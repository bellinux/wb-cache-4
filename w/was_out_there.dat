Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics {{said that he had}} still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and Pat Lawlor.|$|E

500|$|In 1866, a {{year after}} Isabella's death, Samuel was in debt due to the {{collapse}} of Overend and Gurney, a London discount house to which he owed money. To save himself from bankruptcy he sold the copyright to all of his publications for a little over £19,000. Of that, the rights to Household Management were sold to publishers Ward, Lock and Tyler for £3,250.

500|$|Because Perfect Dark Zero was {{intended}} to be an Xbox 360 launch title, the last stage of development was very challenging and several features had to be canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline. The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32, and a [...] "dataDyne TV" [...] mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected. Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed. The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete. Rare later stated they felt very confident they would pass, but it was a significant risk producing 700,000 disks if a bug turned up. According to Botwood, [...] "very few people believed we could make launch, but everything came together in time and it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> for day one." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always very aware of who <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year. By {{the end of the year}} they'd mutate into something much more excited". Gordon credited Memphis for its relaxed atmosphere and cited the album as one of her favorites.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Jason Wade, who {{originally}} finished the song {{in a hotel room}} after he visited a friend in Nashville who needed a kidney transplant. It was produced by John Fields and Scott Faircloff. In an interview with Alternative Addiction, Wade said, [...] "Broken is the song that moves me the most. I wrote it in Nashville, about 6 months ago. I was in my hotel room at 3 AM, I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> visiting a friend... he’s really sick, he needs a kidney transplant." [...] Furthermore, he said, [...] "That [...] song just kinda fell in my lap, and I really haven’t written a song like that since 'Hanging by a Moment' where it just happened within a 15 minute time period." [...] Broken was released as the third single from the album on June 18, 2007. The song was then edited for radio to give it more of a [...] "rock" [...] feel and was released via digital download on July 8, 2008.|$|E

500|$|Rapace {{described}} Shaw, an archaeologist, as {{a believer}} in God with a very strong faith, and said that, [...] "In {{the middle of the}} movie, things happen and she changes into more of a warrior. And in the end, she's such a survivor." [...] To aid her method acting, she developed a complete backstory for Shaw, and worked with a dialect coach to achieve a British accent. She also asked her make-up artist to apply extra blood and sweat during filming to more accurately portray her character. Rapace said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> filming for about six months and it was super-intense, my body was in so much pain sometimes but it was absolutely amazing." [...] She dismissed comparisons to the Alien franchise's Ellen Ripley. Rapace came to director Ridley Scott's attention for her performance as Lisbeth Salander in the 2009 drama film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She met Scott in August 2010, and by January 2011 she had secured the role. Actresses Anne Hathaway, Natalie Portman, Gemma Arterton, Carey Mulligan, and Abbie Cornish were all considered for the role during development. Lucy Hutchinson, who was eight years old in 2012, portrays Shaw as a child.|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{fighting}} {{continued into the}} Makthar Valley, Juskalian {{was assigned to the}} 26th Infantry Regiment's headquarters. When attempting {{to save the life of}} a fellow soldier following heavy fighting, he was captured by German troops at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia on January 28. Juskalian described his capture as follows: [...] "One of our intelligence officers had gone out to check on the situation, and word came back that he'd been wounded and <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere. So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him, but he was dead. Then we came under fire, so we couldn't drag him out of there." [...] After telling the driver to return to the command post, Juskalian investigated the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers. [...] "I thought they were all right because we hadn't heard anything from them, but they'd been overrun by the Germans." [...] Having lost his glasses, Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50feet (15m) away. The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner. Juskalian said about his capture, [...] "I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy, I shouldn't have been there." [...] Juskalian later learned, while still a prisoner of war (POW), that he had been awarded the Silver Star for his rescue attempt. After his first two days of being a POW, he was promoted to major.|$|E

500|$|Rivera {{achieved}} {{a reputation as}} an all-time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers. Hall of Fame starter-turned-closer Dennis Eckersley called him [...] "the best ever, no doubt", while Trevor Hoffman said he [...] "will go down as the best reliever in the game in history". Torre said, [...] "He's the best I've ever been around. Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure, but the calm he puts over the clubhouse." [...] Writer Tom Verducci said, [...] "Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position {{in the history of}} baseball. There is Rivera, a gulf, and then every other closer." [...] He compared Rivera's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said, [...] "Clearly unequivocally, he's the greatest relief pitcher of all time, and did {{it in a way that}} was remarkable." [...] Speaking about Rivera's looming presence at the end of games, Alex Rodriguez said, [...] "He's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen. He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning, because they knew he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that." [...] Gossage said that Rivera [...] "might be the greatest closer of all-time" [...] but suggested that the modern closer's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple-inning [...] "firemen" [...] from Gossage's era; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven-plus outs in his career, whereas Gossage logged 53. Although the Baseball Writers' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame, sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players.|$|E
