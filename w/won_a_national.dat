5|$|In 1997 the UK edition <b>won</b> <b>a</b> <b>National</b> Book Award and a {{gold medal}} in the 9to11year-olds {{category}} of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.

It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults, but did not win. Sandra Beckett comments that books which were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards– for example the literary establishment disdained the works of Roald Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.|$|E
