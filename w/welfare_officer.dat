40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{undergraduate}} thesis was {{to explore}} how the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> at palliative units in Stockholm respond to the patients’ thoughts and experiences during the last phase of life, as well as exploring their picture of the patients experiences. The research questions of the study were: ▪ How do the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> relate to the patients’ experience of their death? ▪ In what way do the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> respond to the dying patient {{and his or her}} experiences? ▪ What knowledge/experience do the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> have and what knowledge/experience do they consider is needed in their profession? To answer the research questions a qualitative method was used where five <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> in three different palliative units were interviewed. The empirical material was analysed through meaning concentration and are presented using exact quotations. It was discovered that the patients experiences cannot be generalized. However, common feelings are those of anxiety, fear and hope, which the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> deal with through methods of counselling, i. e. they listen, ask questions and accommodate. The study revealed that the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> viewed life experience, in different areas, as the most important aspect in order to cope with their work. The result of the study was analysed hermeneutically and phenomenologically. The theoretical framework used in the analysis was experience psychology and counselling as a method...|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 86 % of children aged 2 to 14 are subjected to sexual, emotional and physical abuse globally. Regardless of the vulnerable situations, which expose children {{to the risk of}} being harmed, it is very possible to prevent children from harm by having commitments and deliberate efforts by different actors such as families (including kin), communities, states, NGOs, international organizations, or other stakeholders concerned with the best interests of children. The purpose of this thesis was to explore experiences of collaboration between Advocacy Non Governmental Organizations and Government Social <b>Welfare</b> <b>Officers</b> in preventing children from sexual, emotional and physical abuse in Arusha, Tanzania. The thesis is a fieldwork study employing in-depth interviews as method of data collection. Secondary data was also used in this study. The study included three government social <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> and three representatives from advocacy nongovernmental organizations. The study findings indicated that collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> exists. Furthermore, the study also disclosed opportunities and challenges of collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> Apart from getting their experience of protecting children from harm, the sample was able to demonstrate nature and experience of collaboration between Arusha City Social <b>Welfare</b> <b>Officers</b> and Advocacy NGOs working in the child sector in Arusha...|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, Constantine {{worked for}} the Ministry of Labour and National Service as a <b>Welfare</b> <b>Officer</b> {{responsible}} for West Indians employed in English factories. In 1943, {{the manager of a}} London hotel refused to accommodate Constantine and his family on the grounds of their race; Constantine successfully sued the hotel company. Commentators recognise the case as a milestone in British Racial Equality. Constantine qualified as a barrister in 1954, while also establishing himself as a journalist and broadcaster. He returned to Trinidad in 1954, entered politics and became {{a founding member of the}} People's National Movement, subsequently entering the Trinidad government as minister of communications. From 1961 to 1964, he served as Trinidad's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and, controversially, became involved in issues relating to racial discrimination, including the Bristol Bus Boycott. In his final years, he served on the Race Relations Board, the Sports Council and the Board of Governors of the BBC. Failing health reduced his effectiveness in some of these roles, and he faced criticism for becoming a part of the British Establishment. He died of a heart attack on 1 July 1971, aged 69.|$|E

The authors used a qualitative method and a phenomenological hermeneutics scientific philosophical position. The analys of the data appeared by using three theoretical perspectives; cognitive, coping and Antonovskys Sence of Coherence. The purpose was to get {{a deeper understanding of}} what mindfulness is, how a course in mindfulnessbased stressreduction can be arranged and how it is comprehended by the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> and previous participators of the course. To get an opinion of the issue the authors wanted to know the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> intention of the course, to which patients they provide the course, what the participators thought about their situation before and after the attendence and if they had assimilated the knowledge and if so how it was applicable. The results indicated that the <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> and the patients intentions of the course where incoherent. The <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> intention was to teach the patients a way of manner to incorporate and to handle stress and other disabilities. The patients intention was to get strategies to manage their stress and chronic pain. Their most customary strategies was breathing and consideration of their thoughts...|$|R

40|$|The Aim of {{this study}} was to gain an {{understanding}} of how educational <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> reason and act when there is a suspicion of child maltreatment. An employee who regularly meets children where there is a suspicion of child maltreatment is required by law to report it to social services. Five educational <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> from the Kronoberg county, as well as one from an adjacent county, received vignettes with three fictive accounts of children who were being maltreated.   The educational <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> were then interviewed and asked questions concerning the vignettes. The results and following analysis showed that if there was a suspicion of child maltreatment, then the educational <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> in general reported it to the social services. However, an exception to this was when they believed it not to be in the best interest of the child to report their suspicions. The results further showed that stigma, as described by Goffman (2014), was a factor that could drive the educational <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> towards acting in a way that wasn´t in accordance to what was required by the law. The actions they took could further be understood by using Lipsky´s (2010) “Theory of discretion”, which in this study translated to whether they acted in a way that was either fully in accordance to the law or in a more dubious way. ...|$|R

25|$|Brown {{became a}} medium-paced seamer {{after the war}} and {{organised}} cricket while working as a <b>welfare</b> <b>officer</b> in a Doncaster colliery. When the coal mines were nationalised Brown lost his job and became the captain and assistant-secretary of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club (Northants) in 1949. This revitalised his career as he scored 1,077 runs at 24.47 and took 111 wickets at 27.00 in 1949, Northants improving from seventeenth and last place in the 1948 County Championship to sixth in 1949. As a result, Brown was asked to captain England in the last two Tests against New Zealand, taking two wickets and four catches in a 0–0 series draw. In 1950, he scored 1,108 runs at 38.20 and took 77 wickets at 28.38.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{increase}} our understanding of how secondary schools handle the different forms of bullying in different arenas. The questions we were asking us was how schools work to prevent and treat against bullying based on plans of action, how the schools are responsible in the bullying issues and how the schools and <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> have taken account of sex linkage in bullying issues. Our study is based on the result from seven qualitative semi- structured interviews with secondary school <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> in Sweden.  The study results show that traditional form of bullying takes place through verbal assault, physical violence, ostracism and glances. <b>Welfare</b> <b>officers</b> coincide that there are gender differences in the approach of bullying. In traditional bullying, girls tend to perform the invisible bullying in the form of ostracism and glances while the boys are more represented in the physical bullying and verbal abuse. The results show that some <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> believe that boys and girls bully different amounts on the Internet; girl’s count as overrepresented.  The schools’ work against bullying looks similar; they talk about bullying in classes, they have theme days to increase the community, and they have safe walks, secret notes and peers and break guards. All <b>welfare</b> <b>officers</b> agree that cyber bullying has increased in recent years and many of them believe that the bullying that earlier occurred in the school corridors has been moved to the Internet. All schools have designed plans of action against bullying and the plan is used in the prevention and treatment purpose. The <b>Welfare</b> <b>officers</b> think that cyber bullying is the parents’ responsibility since it takes place at leisure but since the cyber bullying often affects students in school, the school takes responsibility anyway and tries to sort it out between students...|$|R

25|$|Frederick Richard Brown was {{a veteran}} of Douglas Jardine's Bodyline side of 1932-33 and was Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1933. Born in Peru and educated in Chile and Cambridge University he was a big-hearted, self-confident {{red-headed}} all-rounder usually seen wearing a white silk handkerchief round his neck, with a big grin and an avuncular pipe. Over six feet tall and weighing 15 stone (over 200lbs or 100 kilos) he loved to attack the bowling. Captured with Bill Bowes at Tobruk in 1942 Brown {{spent most of the}} Second World War in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy and Germany, where they organised games of cricket, baseball and rugby and lost over 60lbs (30 kilos) before being liberated by the Americans. A leg-spinner for Surrey before the war he became a medium-paced seamer in the late 1940s and organised cricket while working as a <b>welfare</b> <b>officer</b> in a Doncaster colliery. When the coal mines were nationalised Brown lost his job and became the captain and assistant-secretary of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1949. From being in seventeenth and last place in the County Championship in 1948 (and failing to win a county match between 1934 and 1939) Brown led Northants to sixth place in 1949. He was rotated in the England captaincy in 1949-50 with George Mann and Norman Yardley without success. He drew twice against a weak New Zealand in 1949 and lost to the West Indies in 1950. After Mann and Yardley had turned down the Ashes tour Brown impressed the selectors by hitting a six into the Lord's Pavilion while smashing 122 out of 131 runs inside two hours as captain in the Gentlemen v Players match, followed with three quick wickets, and he was offered the post the same afternoon. This was still the age when the England captain had to be a gentleman, even if he was a 'passenger' in the team, Brown having made only 233 runs (23.30) and taken 14 wickets (40.79) in his 9 Tests. Despite his age (he turned 40 on tour) Brown had the most successful series of any England captain in Australia; Taking 18 wickets (21.61) and making 210 runs (26.25), third in the batting averages (behind Len Hutton and Reg Simpson) and in the bowling averages (behind Trevor Bailey and Alec Bedser). Brown's jovial bonhomie and refusal to admit defeat won him many fans in Australia and he was a magnificent ambassador for the game, a role which the MCC regarded quite as important as sporting success, and the scorer Bill Ferguson said it was the easiest, happiest tour he had been on for over 40 years. After losing 4-1 to Australia he won 1-0 in New Zealand and beat South Africa 3-1 at home in 1951. At 42 he was recalled to the England team for the 1953 Lord's Test, where took 4/82 and hit 50 runs to ensure a vital draw in the year England regained the Ashes. Like many amateur captains he was happy to take advice from the senior professional and 'Brown conferred with Len Hutton before he made a bowling change...there was little room for doubt...that Brown had tremendous respect for Hutton's advice on the cricket field', as well he should as the Yorkshireman was recognised as 'a tactical genius, whose advice was often sought', Actually making a northern professional vice-captain was a step too far and this office was granted to the debonair Middlesex batsman Denis Compton, the first professional cricketer to hold that office in living memory. Though Brown also conferred with Compton on the field, it was only after he had spoken to Hutton. The young Trevor Bailey surprised everybody by drawing up plans for dismissing and containing every Australian batsmen, which were used to great effect in the series.|$|E

2500|$|While [...] "wrongful" [...] {{dismissal}} concerns breaches of {{the terms}} of an employment contract, [...] "unfair" [...] dismissal is a claim based on the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 94 to 134A. It governs the reasons for which an employer terminates a contract, and requires they fall into the statutory definition of what is [...] "fair". The Industrial Relations Act 1971, following the Donovan Report 1968, set up its structure. Under ERA 1996 section 94 any employee, who is employed for over two years, may claim for an Employment Tribunal (composed of a judge, an employer and an employee representative) to review the decision. Temporary or seasonal breaks in employment, such as for teachers who are not in class over summer, cannot break the continuity of the contract for the qualifying period, even if a contract purports to be for a fixed term. An employee is only [...] "dismissed" [...] if the employer has decided to end the work relationship, or if they have constructively dismissed the employee through a serious breach of mutual trust and confidence. An employee will not have a claim if they have voluntarily resigned, though a court must be satisfied that someone truly intended to forgo the legal right to sue for unfair dismissal. In Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd v Lineham Mr Lineham used the toilet at work after drinking at the pub. Afterwards, in response to the manager rebuking him in front of other staff, he threw down his keys and drove off. He claimed he was dismissed, and the Tribunal agreed that at no time had Mr Lineham resigned. By contrast in Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp Mr Sharp walked off because the company <b>welfare</b> <b>officer</b> refused to let him collect holiday pay immediately. Although Mr Sharp was in financial difficulty, this was due to his absences, and so he was not justified in leaving, and not constructively dismissed. Under ERA 1996 section 203(1), statutory rights may not be excluded or limited, although section 203(2) and (3) still allows employers and employees to settle a legal claim, so long as the compromise agreement is made freely and with independent legal advice. It has also been held that an employee is not dismissed if the relationship is frustrated. In Notcutt v Universal Equipment Co (London) Ltd a man's heart attack meant he could no longer work. The employer paid no wages during the ordinary notice period, but was successful in arguing that the contract was impossible to perform and therefore void. This doctrine, applicable as a default rule in general contract law, is controversial since unlike commercial parties it will be rare that an employee has the foresight or ability to contract around the rule. The Supreme Court recently emphasised in Gisda Cyf v Barratt that the [...] "need to segregate intellectually common law principles relating to contract law, even in the field of employment, from statutorily conferred rights is fundamental." [...] This meant that when an employee claimed unfair dismissal, after accusations of allegedly inappropriate behaviour at a private party, the three month time limit for her claim only began running when the employer had actually notified her. The general contract law principle that notifications take effect when arriving during business hours was not even [...] "a preliminary guide" [...] to the interpretation of the right to a fair dismissal.|$|E
