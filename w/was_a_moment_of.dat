5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, {{in line with the}} hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

The Test was dominated by an innings of 175 by Ranjitsinhji. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> controversy when Australian batsman Charlie McLeod was run out by Bill Storer when he left his crease after being bowled by a no-ball, when his deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call.

25|$|Benaud, who {{had gone}} in as nightwatchman, {{did not last long}} the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, {{including}} O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254-8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256-8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs.|$|E

500|$|Early in the 2010 {{legislative}} session, Beshear {{presented his}} biennial budget {{proposal to the}} General Assembly. The state projected a $1.5 billion shortfall for the biennium, and Beshear once again proposed {{to make up for}} the shortfall with revenue generated from expanded gambling. Days after Beshear presented the proposal, both House Speaker Stumbo and Senate President Williams declared all gambling legislation [...] "dead" [...] for the session, saying there was no political will in either chamber to pass such legislation ahead of the legislative elections in November. The process of crafting a budget consumed the vast majority of the Assembly's time during the session, but legislators reached the constitutionally mandated end of their session with no agreement. Announcing his intent to call a special session to pass a budget and prevent a state government shutdown, Beshear blasted the leadership of both chambers for discarding his budget proposal. [...] "riting their own budget would be their 'defining moment'," [...] Beshear said the legislators had claimed. [...] "Well, it <b>was.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> abject failure." [...] Beshear said expanded gambling would not be on the agenda for the special session unless an agreement were reached before the session date. In May 2010, legislators reconvened and passed a budget. Beshear utilized his line-item veto on 19 items in the budget, claiming they restricted his ability to implement the reduction in executive expenses mandated by the budget. Legislators were unable to override the vetoes because the special session had already adjourned.|$|E
500|$|The division-rival Braves {{defeated}} the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series; {{on the way}} to doing so, they left the rest of the division behind them.

The Mets and Phillies staged a close battle for second place, with New York coming out ahead, taking 7 victories from the 13-game season series. Both the Mets and Phillies finished {{near the bottom of the}} division in 1996: the Mets ended the season in fourth place, with a 71–91 record, while the Phillies finished last (67–95). The Mets took a second consecutive close season series from the Phillies, with an identical 7–6 record to the prior year. The 1997 Mets improved to 88–74, but that record was only good for third place in the division, as the Braves finished with 101 wins and the Marlins, with a record of 92–70, took the National League wild card and won the 1997 World Series. The Phillies, meanwhile, languished in last place behind the Expos, with a 68–94 record, and only managed to take 5 of 12 games from the Mets that season, including a September 9 game at Shea Stadium that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>of</b> peace in the rivalry to remember former Phillies player and broadcaster and original Met Richie Ashburn, who died that morning.|$|E
