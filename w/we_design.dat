2500|$|The {{philosopher and}} {{psychiatrist}} Karl Jaspers made influential {{use of a}} [...] "biographical method" [...] and suggested ways to diagnose based on the form rather than content of beliefs or perceptions. In regard to classification in general he prophetically remarked that: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>design</b> a diagnostic schema, we {{can only do so}} if we forego something at the outset … and in the face of facts we have to draw the line where none exists... A classification therefore has only provisional value. It is a fiction which will discharge its function if it proves to be the most apt for the time".|$|E

60|$|Now, as was said, {{when they}} had read their letter, and {{perceived}} that it encouraged them in their work, they fell to their way of contriving again, namely, how they might complete their Diabolonian design upon Mansoul. And {{the first thing that}} they agreed upon was to keep all things from Mansoul as close as they could. 'Let it not be known, let not Mansoul be acquainted with what <b>we</b> <b>design</b> against it.' The next thing was, how, or by what means, they should try to bring to pass the ruin and overthrow of Mansoul; and one said after this manner, and another said after that. Then stood up Mr. Deceit, and said, 'My right Diabolonian friends, our lords, and the high ones of the deep dungeon, do propound unto us these three ways.|$|E
