Woolfolk {{noted that he}} was offered under-the-table payments by agents <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in school, as well as cars, and even a job for his stepfather, William Johnson, a Newark dockworker. Woolfolk turned down those offers and signed with Jerry Argovitz.|$|E

5|$|In interviews, Colbert has {{described}} his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children {{that it was}} possible to question the church and still be Catholic. The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> quite young.|$|E

His greatest success came in ECCW, where he had a long rivalry with Kurrgan and won the NWA/ECCW Heavyweight Championship on six occasions. Juggernaut announced his retirement in 2007, as he wanted to quit wrestling <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> healthy.|$|E
5|$|Todd Stone – Gardner's {{son and the}} dealership's Vice President. Stone {{began working}} at G. Stone Motors in 1985 by washing cars <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in school.

5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth. He was sickly as a young child—so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later {{attributed}} his sickness to the poverty his family had to endure. The family moved twice <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, where he would eventually have his funeral service.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1993 (<b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost {{exclusively}} with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began {{to pay off}} in 1999. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 {{and was replaced by}} Sean Foley.|$|E
5|$|Further into chapter 4, Odin {{appoints}} Njörðr and Freyr as {{priests of}} sacrificial offerings, {{and they became}} gods among the Æsir. Freyja is introduced as a daughter of Njörðr, and as the priestess at the sacrifices. In the saga, Njörðr is described as having once wed his unnamed sister <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> among the Vanir, and the couple produced their children Freyr and Freyja from this union, though this custom was forbidden among the Æsir.|$|E
50|$|Kazuya Nanase - Denemon's long lost son. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> {{loved by}} his estranged father, Kazuya is a vengeful man who orchestrates the murders. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> voiced by Eric Kelso in the English version.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{relatively}} {{early in}} Eric's life (<b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> seventeen in the story), he repeatedly expresses {{a desire to}} do good things for other people. This is a thematic element that spans the novel.|$|R

5|$|Harvey {{was also}} notable {{in his time}} for his extravagant lifestyle. The deaths {{of his father and}} elder brother <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a young man {{provided}} Harvey with a considerable fortune, much of which he squandered gambling in London. Harvey's exploits at the gaming tables became legendary, one story claiming that he once bet £100,000 on a single game of chance and lost, only to win most of it back on the following throw. Despite his dissolute lifestyle, Harvey was married and had numerous children; he was survived by six daughters and had three sons who predeceased him.|$|E
5|$|He {{began playing}} for Surrey County Cricket Club's second XI in 1977, but Surrey {{made no move}} to sign him as a player. Leicestershire County Cricket Club did however take note of Agnew's {{impressive}} performances in local club cricket and for Uppingham School, for whom he took 37 wickets at a bowling average of 8 in 1977, and signed him <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a schoolboy in time for the 1978 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as the Republican {{candidate}} for governor. Willson's opponent had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E
50|$|The {{person liable}} for POAT may, <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> alive, elect on a timely basis {{to have such}} {{transactions}} treated as gifts with reservations (thus subject to IHT) with respect to such transactions made in a given tax year.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the album comes from the idea that Caparezza hypothetically dies, like in the last track of the {{previous}} album, but, as he [...] "dies" [...] <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> alive, <b>he</b> can gain from {{the success of the}} album.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the buyer {{may be forced to}} suffer a {{depreciation}} {{in the value of the}} property means that he bears the risk of loss if, for example, the improvements on the property he bought burn down <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in escrow.|$|R
5|$|The inner portion {{contained}} {{the arms of}} Sancho I, {{although the number of}} bezants varied between seven, eleven and sixteen (the latter number was used on Afonso's personal standard <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> Count of Boulogne). This same design was used by the Portuguese kings {{until the end of the}} first dynasty, in 1383; a succession crisis put the country at war with Castile and left it without a ruler for two years.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E
60|$|<b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> {{a little}} boy, {{he will have}} the great {{outlines}} of the human adventure brought home to his mind by all sorts of vivid methods of presentation, such as the poor poverty-struck schools of our own time cannot dream of employing.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Lecter captures Krendler and {{performs}} a craniotomy on him <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> alive. During an elaborate dinner, Lecter scoops spoonfuls of Krendler's forebrain to saute with lemon and capers. In the novel, he feeds Krendler's brain to Starling, who finds it delicious.|$|R
50|$|First, {{it shows}} a {{flashback}} of Gary Wiseman getting a wedgie by some bullies. Than they hang him by his underwear on the flag. Gary takes his revenge by taking the underwear of the bully and putting {{it over his head}} <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> wearing it.|$|R
5|$|As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scamper {{sustained}} a cut to his coronet band {{at the beginning}} of the NFR. James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She wanted that win so she could retire Scamper undefeated <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> in his prime. That year, the pair won both the NFR and WPRA world championships, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history.|$|E
50|$|Deianeira treats his injuries, {{and makes}} love to him <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in a drugged and feverish state. They visit Tiresias, now a prophet, who {{declares}} that {{to atone for}} his sins, he must perform six labors for King Eurystheus and the now Queen Megara.|$|R
5000|$|A {{point is}} scored {{when the ball}} rebounds after hitting either of the 2 frames and touches the ground outside the {{forbidden}} zone, {{any part of the}} defending player's body below the knees, or touches the defending player <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in the forbidden zone.|$|R
