An attempt to assassinate the Pope had been foiled after five street cleaners were spotted <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of Hyde Park, and arrested along with sixth suspect.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1832, {{the militia}} {{caught up with}} Black Hawk's band as they {{attempted}} to cross the Wisconsin River, near present-day Roxbury, in Dane County, near Sauk City, Wisconsin. As the militia approached the battleground, warriors appeared on the surrounding hillsides, attempting to divert their attention. According to Dodge's account, before the militia met {{the main body of}} Black Hawk's band, three U.S. scouts crossed a small band of Sauk or Fox warriors and pursued them to <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of their camp. Scouts also killed two Sauk warriors before the real battle began.|$|E

5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of Massachusetts, {{moving to}} the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of the Catskills and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh {{on its way to}} Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E

5|$|The club {{moved away}} from Filbert Street in 2002 to a new 32,500 all-seater stadium. The stadium was {{originally}} named The Walkers Stadium in a deal with food manufacturers Walkers, whose brand logo can still be found in some areas around {{the outside of the}} stadium. The first match hosted at Walkers was a 1–1 friendly draw against Athletic Bilbao, with Bilbao's Tiko being the first scorer at the stadium and Jordan Stewart being the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford. The stadium has since hosted an England international against Serbia and Montenegro, which finished 2–1 to England, as well as internationals between Brazil and Jamaica, and Jamaica and Ghana. The stadium has been used to host the Heineken Cup European Rugby semi-finals for the Leicester Tigers rugby club, itself based <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of the King Power Stadium.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} {{bank of the}} river, NY31 exits NY690 but joins NY370 {{at the end of}} the exit ramp. Together, NY31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, {{intersecting}} NY48 in the village center. Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander New Community and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E
5|$|The 1843 {{event was}} {{followed}} by eruptions in 1849, 1851, 1852, and 1855, with the 1855 flows being particularly extensive. 1859 marked {{the largest of the}} three historical flows that have been centered on Mauna Loa's northwestern flank, producing a long lava flow that reached the ocean on Hawaii island's west coast, north of Kiholo Bay. An eruption in 1868 occurred alongside the enormous 1868 Hawaii earthquake, a magnitude eight event that claimed 77 lives and remains the largest earthquake ever to hit the island. Following further activity in 1871, Mauna Loa experienced nearly continuous activity from August 1872 through 1877, a long-lasting and voluminous eruption lasting approximately 1,200 days and never moving beyond its summit. A short single-day eruption in 1877 was unusual in that it took place underwater, in Kealakekua Bay, and <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of the shoreline; curious onlookers approaching the area in boats reported unusually turbulent water and occasional floating blocks of hardened lava. Further eruptions occurred in 1879 and then twice in 1880, the latter of which extended into 1881 and came within the present boundaries of the island's largest city, Hilo; however, at the time, the settlement was a shore-side village located further down the volcano's slope, and so was unaffected.|$|E

5|$|York City F.C. {{played at}} Fulfordgate in Fulford, on the {{southern}} outskirts of York, from 1922 to 1932. It was difficult for most supporters to reach, being a good distance from the railway station, and the tram service to Fulford only had a single track. Attendances declined in the club's second and third seasons in the Football League, which the directors blamed on Fulfordgate's location. One director, G. W. Halliday, became convinced that the only solution was {{to move to a}} new ground. York Cricket Club left Bootham Crescent, their home for around 50 years, for a new ground at Wigginton Road in January 1932. Preliminary discussions and visits to Bootham Crescent took place, and the directors believed that renting the ground would be cheaper than repaying the debts on Fulfordgate. Further, Bootham Crescent was situated near the centre of the city, and the population living <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of the site was, at 30,000, 10 times that within a similar radius of Fulfordgate. However, two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Division was {{temporarily}} relieved and to cover its replacement by the US Fifth Army, BSquadron {{was attached to}} the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from Emboli to the Arno River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the Pesa River. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, moving with the division to Iesi on the Adriatic. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to Fano on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at Rimini, advancing along Route 16 towards Ravenna. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility. Wilder Force was re-formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine-gun platoon and it began crossing the Fiumicino River on 15 October. Four days later, Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles. On 21 October, B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around Pisignano and were <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> of the town {{by the end of the}} day. Since it was strongly held by the Axis, the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew.|$|E
