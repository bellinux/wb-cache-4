5|$|The Duke's train had {{run more}} slowly through {{populated}} areas {{owing to the}} cheering crowds, {{and by the time}} it reached Parkside the first two trains on the northern track, Phoenix and North Star, had already passed through Parkside and had pulled up ahead of the station waiting for the Duke's train to depart. By now, the passengers in the Duke's train had been travelling for almost an hour, and the <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> at Parkside was the only scheduled stop on the journey. Although it was beginning to drizzle, and despite a request from the railway engineers for passengers to remain on the trains, at 11.55am around 50 men disembarked from the Duke's train to stretch their legs. The group consisted of many of the most influential figures of the day, including the Marquess of Stafford, Charles Arbuthnot, Prince Esterh√°zy, the Earl of Wilton, L founder Joseph Sandars and William Huskisson. As the rain had formed deep puddles {{on either side of the}} railway embankment, most of the party remained on or near the railway tracks.|$|E
25|$|A <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> on the Santa Fe Railroad since 1882, {{the site}} was largely {{unsettled}} until the early 20th century. In 1910, Ralph, Clifford and Effie Corum built a homestead {{on the edge of}} Rogers Lake. The Corums proved instrumental in attracting other settlers and building infrastructure in the area, and when a post office was commissioned for the area, they named it Muroc, a reversal of the Corum name, because there was already a town named Coram.|$|E
25|$|Freight trains use the {{existing}} loop to allow passenger trains to pass {{them on the}} main line. Steam locomotives on special charters that are not stopping in the station also use the loop as a <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> because nearby road access can allow a water tender to reach the line. It also prevents such trains from blocking the main line or a platform at Newbury. All continuing trains using the loop at the racecourse must also travel through the loop on the down platform at Newbury to rejoin the main line.|$|E

2500|$|Given the headcode 1Z63, Tornado {{was booked}} to {{complete}} the [...] journey in 8hours 2minutes, without any passenger stops in stations, but with four water stops en route at Grantham, York, Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne Yard) and Berwick, totalling 95minutes booked stoppage time. The crew changed over at York; and at the <b>water</b> <b>stop</b> at Tyne Yard Tornado also took on more coal.|$|E

5000|$|Many <b>water</b> <b>stops</b> along new {{railways}} {{evolved into}} new settlements. When a train <b>stopped</b> for <b>water</b> and was positioned by a water tower, the boilerman swung out the spigot arm {{over the water}} tender and [...] "jerked" [...] the chain to begin watering. This {{gave rise to a}} 19th-century slang term [...] "Jerkwater town" [...] for towns too insignificant to have a regular train station. Some <b>water</b> <b>stops</b> grew into established settlements: for example, the town of Coalinga, California, formerly, Coaling Station A, gets its name from the original coal stop at this location. On the other hand, with the replacement of steam engines by diesel locomotives many of the then obsolete <b>water</b> <b>stops,</b> especially in deserted areas, became ghost towns.|$|R
2500|$|The Jaguar {{finally took}} the overall lead from Tornado {{as she was}} {{stationary}} in Tyne Yard taking on coal and water. Having repaired the carburettor, Hammond resumed the race but was way behind, near Leeds by the time Clarkson and May were approaching Newcastle. As Tornado departed Tweedmouth sidings following her final <b>water</b> <b>stop,</b> May has a small lead, being about [...] north of Berwick.|$|E
2500|$|Marfa {{was founded}} in the early 1880s as a {{railroad}} <b>water</b> <b>stop.</b> The town was named [...] "Marfa" [...] {{at the suggestion of}} the wife of a railroad executive. Although some historians have hypothesized that the name came from a character in Fyodor Dostoevsky novel The Brothers Karamazov, Marfa was actually named after Marfa Strogoff, a character in the Jules Verne novel Michael Strogoff. The town grew quickly during the 1920s.|$|E

2500|$|By Colton Junction, Tornado {{had reduced}} the lag to 2minutes, {{but due to}} a series of signals at the yellow warning aspect, on arrival at the York <b>water</b> <b>stop,</b> Tornado was again 5minutes behind schedule. A quick stop meant that she left York on time, having been {{serviced}} by a road tanker. The time taken from London to reach Peterborough, Grantham and York were all preservation era records. Back on schedule and nearing the finish line, Tornado was forced to slow down for a stopping train ahead of her, as she approached Waverley. Also, as revealed on the programme, during {{the latter part of the}} race approaching the Berwick stop, Tornado's speed had to be temporarily reduced to [...] due to one of the steam injectors (which is a device which uses the boiler's own steam to transfer water from the tender into the boiler, over-coming the high pressure within the boiler) failing to operate for 10minutes, risking the boiler running dry which would have necessitated dropping the fire to prevent major damage.|$|E

We will now take a solid cylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water, and plunge 4 inches of it into the water, so {{that the end of the}} cylinder comes down to the 6-inch mark. Well, that displaces 2 pints of water. What becomes of them? Why, if there were no more cylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to the 12-inch mark. But unfortunately there is more cylinder, occupying half the space between the 10-inch and the 12-inch marks, so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there. What becomes of the other pint? Why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and fill the jar up to the 13-inch mark. But unfortunately----Shade of Newton!" [...] he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror.
