500|$|Roy Hrab of the DVD Verdict was {{negative}} towards the DVD, saying [...] "adults <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> further, but, more importantly, I think kids (except {{for the very}} young) will be less then [...] impressed. Without question, the energy and imagination level of the show has dropped precipitously." [...] He criticized the featured song, [...] "Idiot Friends", saying it was [...] "extremely idiotic (and not in a funny way)." [...] Mike McGuire of Napster, on the song [...] "Idiot Friends", said [...] " [...] illustrate SpongeBob's dedication to total absurdity, irreverence and harmlessly off-color gags." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Brannigan Lynch from Entertainment Weekly was {{disappointed}} with the track and called it underwhelming. He added: [...] "Anyone hoping this collaboration with Wayne would mean a new direction for [...] <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> 'Revolver' is pretty standard Top 40 background listening—more of the same electro R she played around with on Hard Candy. [...] It’s not bad by any stretch, but it certainly won’t {{end up on the}} next greatest-hits collection she releases ten years from now." [...] However, he praised the chorus line calling it Madonna's [...] "unnerring knack for writing charmingly frivolous lyrics." [...] While reviewing the album, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "glitched-out dance-floor stomper" [...] and called the chorus a [...] "lyrical come-on".|$|E

We <b>will</b> only <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> if we think that a world conference is supposed to solve problems. Is there any point in {{getting a lot of}} people together, at great expense, just to address a problem without any prospect of solving it? My answer is a qualified yes. A world conference is a cultural artifact. It has an impact upon our collective sense of civilization...|$|R
500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons. The comedy is more targeted at the kids than in the past." [...] In particular, Hrab cited the episode [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] as [...] "tiresome (for adults, anyway; kids will enjoy it)." [...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed,</b> but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for the kids and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement". He added [...] " [...] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave." ...|$|E
500|$|Booth argues that, {{whatever}} Larkin's motive {{in writing}} it, the story follows {{the parameters of}} schoolgirl fiction with some fidelity. Its main characters all have models within the genre; Marie has {{much in common with}} Dorita Fairlie Bruce's recurrent character [...] "Dimsie", while Hilary is likewise based on Dorothy Vicary's villainous [...] "Una Vickers" [...] in Niece of the Headmistress. The usual themes of friendships, rivalries and injustices are explored, and the ending in reconciliation and future hope is entirely true to type. Some scenes—the savage beating endured by Marie, the lingering descriptions of girls dressing and undressing, Hilary's smouldering sexuality—may, Booth asserts, be written with [...] "the lusts of the male heterosexual gaze" [...] in mind but, he continues, the reader looking for explicit pornography <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed.</b> Bradford notes three prose styles combining in the narrative: [...] "cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism... and... its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement". Motion finds the tone of the prose frivolous on the surface, yet fundamentally cold and cruel: [...] "Once its women have been arraigned for pleasure they are dismissed; once they have been enjoyed they are treated with indifference".|$|E
500|$|Of the {{original}} reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan wrote that EarthBound {{was not as}} impressive as Final Fantasy III, although just as fun. He praised the game's humor and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions. Des Barres wrote that [...] "past the graphics", which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an [...] "entry level" [...] or a [...] "child's" [...] RPG, but [...] "highly intelligent" [...] and [...] "captivating". The Brazilian Super GamePower explained that those expecting a Dungeons and Dragons-style RPG <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games. They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners. GamePro gave the game a mixed review, commenting that [...] "he lack of a convincing story line and the dull NES-clone graphics ... will make serious RPG fans a little cautious about approaching EarthBound". They said the [...] "saving graces are the fairly good music" [...] and [...] "hilarious adult humor" [...] but added that [...] "the humor is too mature for little kids, and the gameplay is too immature for older gamers." ...|$|E

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The Guardian, Killian Fox said Between the Times and the Tides was [...] "more interesting sonically in {{the tension between}} questing guitars and straightforward song structures {{than it is in}} terms of lyrics, which aim to be down to earth but end up middle of the road." [...] NME writer John Doran wrote, [...] "sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm-hearted, Neil Young-like intensity. Those wanting clangour and dissonance <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed,</b> but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Grayson Currin deemed it a [...] "motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods, acoustic entreaties, and cloying pop-rockers" [...] but that [...] "Ranaldo's opportunity {{to step out of the}} Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity." [...] Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as: [...] "while it may be traditional in structure, Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance. The playing may draw on jazz, country, rock and Ranaldo's own avant-garde catalogue." [...] In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes found it [...] "great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out.

2500|$|The {{game was}} not {{considered}} either a critical or commercial success. Many reviews called the game uninspired, mediocre, and unable to compete with many other similar, higher reviewed [...] platform games at the time, such as Super Mario 64, Rayman 2, or Banjo Kazooie. A major complaint was the game's camera, with GameSpot's Nintendo 64 version review stating that they felt the camera was on a [...] "kamikaze mission to destroy the game". GameSpot's review of the Windows version was even more negative, concluding with [...] "Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it. Fans of the series <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the lackluster translation of the characters into three dimensions. Everyone else will be frustrated by the horrible camera." [...] IGN was slightly more forgiving for the Nintendo 64 version, giving it a 7.3, praising sound, graphics, and presentation, but still criticizing the camera and lasting appeal.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} post-2013 {{proposal}} by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines {{the lack of}} ambition in tackling the issue. [...] "This CAP reform {{was not intended to}} address the trade barriers used to keep some EU market prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various trade agreements, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing countries <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of direct payments was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets." [...] In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although much depends {{on the size of the}} payments and how they are made.|$|E

2500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{rated the}} album three stars {{out of five}} and {{compared}} it to Janet Jackson's 1986 album Control, commenting: [...] "For the most part, Full Moon is certainly a forward-minded album, lifting Brandy's typically schmaltzy brand of pop-R to a new, edgier plateau [...] The all-grown-up Miss Moesha seems to be making her final transition from sitting up in her room to {{sitting on top of}} the world." [...] Billboard magazine praised Full Moon for its ballads and the leading single but was unsatisfied with the album as a whole, stating that [...] "those expecting more from the same [...] <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed,</b> it's a fairly paint-by-numbers affair." [...] Devon Thomas, writer for The Michigan Daily, was generally disappointed with the album. He said that [...] "heavily producer-driven, the album follows the template that catapulted her sophomore album to multi-platinum status. The tradition (or condition) continues on her junior outing, [...] exhibits the same ole Jerkins production we've heard time and time before, just slightly altered (or [...] "updated") and equipped." [...] Critical with mainstream R in general, he further summed: [...] "We know it'll be another hit, another platinum plaque for the Moe-ster, but will this album go down on any 'Best of the Decade' lists? Highly unlikely." [...] Rolling Stone dismissed the album as [...] "frantic, faceless, fake-sexy R" [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] rating.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller {{scored the}} PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.1 out of 10, calling the game [...] "a satisfying, lengthy adventure," [...] and arguing [...] "it remains {{faithful to the}} classic film while managing to create a compelling story of its own [...] it handles the source material respectfully and manages to offer enough new content to feel like {{more than just a}} by-the-numbers adaptation of the movie." [...] IGN's Douglass C. Perry scored the PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 7.9 out of 10, with the Xbox version finishing as runner-up in the March 2006 [...] "Xbox Game of the Month" [...] award, losing to [...] Perry praised the concept of placing a new character in the existing narrative; [...] "Much of the story is carefully untarnished, so when you see pivotal scenes, they will be left relatively untouched. You'll hear and see these key scenes unfolding in front of you, but you'll be in the house, the car, the church, or the hospital as a close associate, rather than a bystander. You'll feel like an insider who's part of a great powerful narrative, and the feeling is eerily remarkable." [...] Although he was critical of the melee combat and the driving portions of the game, he called the extortion system [...] "awesome fun." [...] He concluded, [...] "people looking for a perfect game <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>disappointed</b> [...] there are elements that totally stand out from any similar games in this genre, from the extortion system to the business take-over model. Despite obvious areas in need of improvement, I had a blast playing The Godfather." [...] GameSpy's Will Tuttle scored the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 3.5 out of 5. Praising the use of the license, he wrote [...] "the game is best viewed as a complementary addition to the Godfather universe," [...] calling it [...] "an ultimately entertaining sandbox game that doesn't really do much to help or hurt the license." ...|$|E
