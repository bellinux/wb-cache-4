After meeting {{her at the}} Naval and Military Club in Piccadilly, he complained of feeling unwell and Victoria persuaded him to rest in a room they had booked in the club annexe. She called a doctor, who {{prescribed}} some medicine and Victoria went out to fill the prescription at a nearby pharmacist's. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Louis was dead. On her widowhood, Victoria moved into a grace-and-favour residence at Kensington Palace and, {{in the words of}} her biographer, [...] "became a central matriarchal figure in the lives of Europe's surviving royalty". In 1930, her eldest daughter, Alice, suffered a nervous breakdown and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. In the following decade Victoria was largely responsible for her grandson Philip's education and upbringing during his parents' separation and his mother's institutionalisation. Prince Philip recalled, [...] "I liked my grandmother very much and she was always helpful. She was very good with children... she took the practical approach to them. She treated them in the right way—the right combination of the rational and the emotional." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and told her they could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to try to write some lyrics, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> Perry would already have the whole song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs. After working with other musicians, Stefani and Perry worked together on [...] "The Real Thing". On October 3, 2005, Interscope Records released the song as a promotional single exclusively in the Philippines. The label released a CD single, which featured the album version and a remix by Wendy & Lisa of the song.|$|E

500|$|A {{part of this}} Mahal was {{converted}} into a temple and named Rama Raja Temple in honour of the god Rama. There is legend associated with naming it as a temple. According to a local legend, the temple was built following Rani Ganeshkuwari, the queen getting a [...] "dream visitation" [...] by Lord Rama directing her to build a temple for Him; while Madhukar Shah was a devotee of Krishna, his wife's dedication was to Rama. Following this a new temple known as the Chaturbuj Temple was approved to be built, and the queen went to Ayodhya to obtain an image of Lord Rama {{that was to be}} enshrined in her new temple. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from Ayodhya with the image of Rama, initially she kept the idol in her palace as the Chaturbuj Temple was still under construction. She was, however, unaware of an injunction that the image to be deified in a temple could not be kept in a palace. Once the temple construction was completed and the idol of the lord had to be moved for installation at the Chatrubhuj Temple, it refused to be shifted from the palace. Hence, instead of the Chaturbhuj Temple, the Rama's idol remained in the palace where as the Chaturbhuj Temple remained without an idol in its sanctum. As Rama was worshipped in the palace, part of the palace {{was converted}} into the Rama Raja Temple; it is the only shrine in the country where Rama is worshipped as a King. The temple is guarded by a police force and the deity, Lord Rama, is considered as the king and is given a gun salute of honour every day.|$|E
500|$|Now {{two years}} since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{never before}} worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup [...] "rather daunting" [...] and {{described}} the three to four hour application process {{before moving on to}} costuming. [...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all was said and done, only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible. [...] After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to overexpress to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. [...] <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. [...] Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting {{was the name of the}} game when working under such protheses.|$|E
