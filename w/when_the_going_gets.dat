Although he called AJ the [...] "family rebel", {{he said that the}} character is [...] "doing what he can to help out with the money problems [...] <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough, AJ will step in to help his loved ones—and while he will probably never take the conventional route, he'll always get something sorted out in the end." [...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her. Sharma explained: [...] "He is ready to test her promise to the limits! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab's buttons, and now he's going {{to take full advantage of}} the fact that she won't let herself be the control freak she normally likes to be!" [...] Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said AJ is [...] "thoroughly enjoying" [...] testing Zainab's new policy.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

He wanted to know more about the Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in my pocket and I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, and you are the first one to chuck the towel in <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite".

5000|$|... "What a Girl Wants" [...] is a teen pop-R&B {{track with}} some {{similarities}} to her debut single [...] "Genie in a Bottle". Written {{in the key}} of C major the track begins with the lyrics [...] "What a girl wants, what a girl needs, whatever makes me happy sets you free" [...] and is set at a tempo 142 beats per minute. The vocal range is F♯3-E♭6. Anthony [...] from Buffalo News described the track as a [...] "light hip-hop song" [...] {{in comparison to the}} previous single. Aguilera's vocals have been compared to that of Mariah Carey, with Carey's single [...] "Emotions" [...] being the grounds for these comparisons. In Aguilera's vocal performance she starts singing in a lower register and [...] "carefully" [...] scales notes until she reaches [...] "the highest echelon of her upper register". During the track Aguilera performs the lyrics [...] "A girl needs somebody sensitive but tough, Somebody there <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>going</b> <b>get</b> rough." [...] <b>The</b> track that was released as a single was a revised version of the song, it focused more upon the [...] "funky R&B edge", and with Aguilera taking participation in the revision her additions made the track lighter and a mix of [...] "pop and R&B". But despite this Aguilera was disappointed in her lack of input into the single saying;"I was held back a lot from doing more R&B ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to hear me out because of my age, and that was a little bit frustrating. But I want to write more about experiences I've gone through. I've gone through bad situations. I come from a divorced home. I've been around abuse. I've lived a different life, been on the outside." ...|$|R
