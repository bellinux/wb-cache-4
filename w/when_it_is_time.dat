25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the balls are physically locked in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual ball locks instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} locked balls and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for them to be released.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for a cell {{to enter}} S phase, {{complexes}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and cyclin A), which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair {{by helping to}} attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by Cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by Cyclin E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has happened in a person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E
25|$|That {{summer and}} fall, the Ingalls again plant a garden and fields, and store {{food for the}} winter. Pa trades labor with other farmers so that his own crops will be {{harvested}} faster <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time.</b> Not all work was farming. Hunting and gathering were important parts of providing for the Ingalls as well. When Pa went into the woods to hunt, he usually came home with a deer and then smoked the meat for the coming winter. One day he noticed a bee tree and returned early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When he returned in winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle; he was too tired from farm work to play during summer. In the winter, they enjoyed the comforts of their home and danced to Pa’s fiddle playing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a couple minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E

The males each have their own area on the forest floor where they make their courts. The size of each court is about [...] in diameter, and the next bird is often about [...] away. The females and males live separately; only <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to mate do females fly over to observe and choose a male. When this occurs, the females tap the males from behind and insemination quickly follows. When females approach a lek, the males stand firmly and present themselves rigidly.|$|E

2500|$|The female common ostrich lays her fertilised eggs in {{a single}} {{communal}} nest, a simple pit, [...] deep and [...] wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest.

2500|$|Pike are {{physically}} capable of breeding {{at an age}} of about two years, spawning in spring when the water temperature first reaches about [...] They {{have a tendency to}} lay a large number of eggs.

In females, the gonads enlarge <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to shed her eggs. However, after they are shed, these eggs will not hatch if the water is below [...] Male pike arrive to the breeding grounds before females do, preceding them by a few weeks. In addition, the males stay after the spawning is finished. Parental stock is vital for pike success. Egg survival {{has been shown to be}} positively correlated with number of eggs laid. For breeding, the more stable the water, the greater the fitness of the pike. Mortality results from toxic concentrations of iron or rapid temperature changes, and adult abundance and the strength of the resulting year classes are not related. It is based upon two points of development: one during embryo stage between fertilization and closure of the blastopore, and the second between hatching and the termination of the alevin stage.|$|E

2500|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which is safer but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are then released into rivers, often in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This practice was very common in countries like Sweden before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies, as anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, limiting a company's chances of benefiting financially from their investment. Because of this, the method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non profit groups like the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association as a way of artificially increasing salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvest, construction of dams, and habitat destruction or disruption. Unfortunately, there can be negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation, including genetic [...] "dilution" [...] of the wild stocks, and many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls and habitat improvement and protection. A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for them to spawn, they return to where they were released where fishermen can then catch them.|$|E
2500|$|American {{crocodiles}} {{breed in}} late fall or early winter, engaging in drawn-out mating ceremonies in which males emit {{very low frequency}} bellows to attract females. Body size {{is more important than}} age in determining reproductive capabilities, and females reach sexual maturity at a length of about [...] In February or March, gravid females will begin to create nests of sand, mud, and dead vegetation along the water's edge. Nest location is crucial, and with the correct amount of vegetation, the eggs will develop within a small temperature range. Because sex determination is temperature-dependent in crocodilians, slight aberrations in temperature may result in all-male or all-female clutches, which would possibly harm the health of the population. About one month later, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> to lay, the female will dig a wide hole diagonally {{into the side of the}} nest and lay 30 to 70 eggs in it, depending on her size. After laying, the female may cover the eggs with debris or leave them uncovered. The white, elongated eggs are [...] long and [...] wide and have a number of pores in the brittle shell. During the 75- to 80-day incubation period, the parents will guard the nest, often inhabiting a hole in the bank nearby. Females especially have been known to guard their nests with ferocity. But in spite of these precautions, American crocodile eggs sometimes fall prey to raccoons (Procyon sp.) (arguably the most virulent natural predator of crocodilian nests in the Americas), coatis, foxes, skunks or other scavenging mammals (even coyotes (Canis latrans) in Mexico and American black bears (Ursus americanus)) in south Florida), as well as large predatory ants, crabs and vultures. In Panama, green iguana (Iguana iguana) were seen to dig up and prey on American crocodile eggs occasionally, although in several cases were caught by the mother American crocodile and subsequently consumed. Crocodilian eggs are somewhat brittle, but softer than bird eggs. Young of this species hatch after 75–80 days.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the large}} flocks break {{up in the}} winter, they form into three loose groups: single males, flocks of between two and fifteen females, and a large flock of yearlings. As this time approaches, males become more {{aggressive}} towards each other. Then they start courting females by calling and raising the front of their body up while keeping their neck straight and ruffling their plumage. They will raise their wings and may run some distance like this, sometime flapping their wings methodically. After doing this and attracting females, they will continue calling at a specific female, and will start to either walk alongside her or {{in front of her}} while spreading his wings and lowering his head. As the display continues, he will get more intense and animated and start waving his neck around and in figure eights. Once he has attracted a first mate he will copulate with her and then lead her to his nest. [...] <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>time</b> for the eggs to be laid, the male will typically be on the nest already and will act aggressive when approached by the female, covering his nest with his wings. He will gradually relax and allow her to crouch and lay the egg {{at the edge of the}} nest. The male will roll the egg into his nest. Males are simultaneously polygynous, females are serially polyandrous. In practice, this means that the females move around during breeding season, mating with a male and depositing their eggs with the male before leaving him and mating with another male. Males on the other hand are sedentary, attending the nests and taking care of incubation and the hatchlings all on their own. Although recent evidence suggest that dominant males may enlist a subordinate male to roost for him while he starts a second nest with a second harem. [...] The nests are thus collectively used by several females and can contain as many as 80 eggs laid by a dozen females; each individual female's clutch numbers some 5–10 eggs. However, the average clutch size is 26 with 7 different females eggs. Recent evidence has shown that some males will utilize subordinate males to help incubate and protect the eggs. If this happens, the dominant male will find a second harem and start the process over again.|$|E
