5|$|In December, Kan Ek' {{despatched}} AjChan {{to negotiate}} peace with Spain, with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida {{by a small}} number of Mopans from the Tipuj region. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from Chichen Itza in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza–Kowoj hostility. Kan Ek' sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain. The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery. The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Hopewell again {{received}} {{negative publicity}} {{from the national}} news media when {{it was discovered that}} Evelyn Rust Wells, an elderly <b>woman,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> held captive and terrorized in her home in the City Point section. Her captors, mostly male teenagers under 18, cashed her Social Security checks at local grocery stores. A local grocer noted a change in purchases from when neighborhood kids assisted Wells, and called the police. They investigated and freed Wells who was by then severely malnourished.|$|E
25|$|Long {{moved to}} the Tampa area in 1983. Hillsborough County had been {{averaging}} about 30 to 35 homicides {{per year in the}} eighties. Then, in 1984, the murder rate escalated. During one eight-month period, a killer with a unique method of binding, raping and killing his victims, then dumping them in unusual positions and poses, was averaging a murder every other week. The first victim was discovered in May 1984, when the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (HCSO) was called to a crime scene where the body of a nude <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found.|$|E

25|$|The corpse {{was badly}} decomposed, {{although}} the pathologist who examined Fleszar's remains {{was able to}} determine the young <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stabbed approximately 30 times {{in the chest and}} abdomen with a knife or other sharp object, that her feet had been severed just above the ankle, the thumb and sections of the fingers of one hand were missing, and that one forearm had been severed from her body (these severed appendages were never found). Despite the advanced state of decomposition, the pathologist was also able to locate multiple lineal abrasions upon the victim's chest and torso, indicating that Fleszar had been extensively beaten before her death. Although police theorized that Fleszar had been raped, the advanced state of decomposition of the corpse had erased any conclusive evidence of sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{occasions}} were the bullying was not intentional, but still occurred. It {{should be noted}} that even if the bullying was not consciously intended it can still have awful impacts. One study concluded that people had been ostracised online as a way of protecting another group of people. One <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being the bullied person. While the motivations {{of the authors of the}} website are unknown, it can be assumed that they did not specifically aim to target the person effected and thus the bullying was an inconsiderate result.|$|E
25|$|Little {{physical}} evidence existed beyond eyewitness descriptions and forensic reports. Police had noted (and {{would continue to}} note) common denominators in the physical characteristics of the victims, {{and the manner in}} which they died: all of the victims had been brunette Caucasians; each (excluding Mixer) had been the recipient of extensive violence inflicted with a blunt and/or bladed instrument prior to her murder; each of the victims' bodies had been found within a 15-mile radius of Washtenaw County; and each victim (again excluding Mixer) had received knife wounds to the neck. Furthermore, each victim had been found with an item of clothing tied around her neck, and each <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> menstruating at the time of her death. These factors led police to publicly conclude the same perpetrator was responsible for at least three of the murders thus far committed.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times, murdering an {{unidentified}} woman in Krasny Sulin in April and two boys in May and July. His first murder victim was lured off a train at Krasny Sulin before Chikatilo bound her hands {{behind her back}} and stuffed her mouth with dirt, before severing her nose from her face and inflicting numerous knife wounds to her neck. Chikatilo then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} slab of concrete; her body was found on 6 April. Investigators noted that the knife wounds inflicted upon this victim were similar to those inflicted on the victims linked to the manhunt and killed between 1982 and 1985, but as the <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed with a slab of concrete and had not been disemboweled, investigators were unsure whether to link this murder to the investigation. In May, Chikatilo killed a 9-year-old boy, named Aleksey Voronko, in Ilovaisk, Ukraine. The boy's wounds left no doubt the killer had struck again, and this murder was linked to the manhunt. On 14 July, Chikatilo killed 15-year-old Yevgeny Muratov at Donleskhoz station near Shakhty. Muratov's murder was also linked to the investigation, although his body was not found until April 1989. Although his remains were largely skeletal, Muratov's autopsy revealed he had been emasculated, and suffered at least 30 knife wounds.|$|E
25|$|Regan's patrol left Wyndham on 1 June, to {{hunt for}} Hay's unknown killer, meeting up with St Jack's patrol at Jowa. The police patrol now {{consisted}} of four whites, one of them Fred Hay's partner Leopold Overheu, two settlers specially sworn in by Gribble as policemen, seven Aboriginal trackers, 42 pack horses/mules and led by Constables James St Jack and Denis Regan. On 4 July, the patrol returned to the Forrest River mission with some 30 Aboriginal men in chains, among them Lumbia, who, when questioned through an interpreter, confessed to having killed Hay. Over the following weeks several Aboriginal women attended the mission to have bullet wounds treated and it was claimed that the sister of another <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot dead by the patrol and her baby bashed to death. In the months that followed, rumours circulated of a massacre by the police party. Attempts by the sergeant of police at Wyndham to investigate the rumours were met by refusals by those implicated to cooperate or answer claims they were involved. Rev. Gribble alleged that 30 {{men and women were}} missing who he suspected had been killed by the police party. Local Aborigines claimed up to 100 men women and children had been killed. Two years later Professor A. P. Elkin visited the area and estimated 20 had been killed.|$|E
25|$|Jerusalem {{was still}} being rebuilt {{following}} the destruction caused by Titus in AD 70. Emperor Hadrian had built during the 130s a temple over the site of Jesus's tomb near Calvary, and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to Venus or Jupiter. According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose {{at the end of}} the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in Ambrose, On the Death of Theodosius (died 395) and at length in Rufinus' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, the main body of which does not mention the event. Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to be swayed by anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered, and Helena declared the cross with which the <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> touched to be the True Cross. On the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena. Sozomen and Theodoret claim that Helena also found the nails of the crucifixion. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse.|$|E

A KVM monitor told reporters: [...] "Our initial feelings are that this was a normal military operation... not a set-up."

Eight KLA fighters had been killed near the site of the ambush just eleven days prior.|$|E
500|$|In early 2001, Baird {{announced}} that his government's proposed drug-testing {{plan would be}} extended to identify welfare recipients addicted to prescription drugs and alcohol. He later {{announced that}} provincial welfare applicants {{would be required to}} pass a literacy test. The Harris government's welfare policies were put under scrutiny in August 2001 after a pregnant woman in Sudbury, Kimberly Rogers, died while serving a house arrest for welfare fraud. The <b>woman</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> confined to her apartment for three months and reports indicated that her pregnancy was [...] "exacerbated by sweltering conditions in her apartment". Responding to criticism, Baird said that he could not comment on the specifics of the case until a coroner's inquest was completed. He defended his government's general policy on welfare issues. A subsequent inquest did not assign blame to the government for the woman's death, but recommended that lifetime bans for fraud be eliminated, and that adequate food, housing and medication be provided to anyone under house arrest.|$|E
