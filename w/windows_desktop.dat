25|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search was {{initially}} released as MSN Desktop Search, {{as a part}} of the MSN Toolbar suite. It was re-introduced as <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search with version 2, while still being distributed with MSN Toolbar Suite.|$|E

When sharing applications individually (rather than the entire desktop), the windows are managed (whether they are minimized or maximized) independently at the server and the client side.|$|E

25|$|For Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, {{it came in}} two flavors, one {{for home}} users {{and the other for}} {{enterprise}} use. The only difference between the two was that the latter could be configured via group policy. The home edition was bundled with MSN Toolbar, while the other was available as a standalone application. Later, when MSN Toolbar was discontinued in favor of Windows Live Toolbar, the home edition of <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search was discontinued as well.

25|$|Windows Search collectively {{refers to}} the indexed search on Windows Vista and later {{versions}} of Windows (also referred to as Instant Search) as well as <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search, a standalone add-on for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 made available as freeware. All incarnations of Windows Search share a common architecture and indexing technology and use a compatible application programming interface (API).|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{features}} Prioritized I/O {{which allows}} developers to set application I/O priorities for read/write disk operations, similar to how currently application processes/threads {{can be assigned}} CPU priorities. I/O has been enhanced with I/O asynchronous cancellation and I/O scheduling based on thread priority. Background applications running in low priority I/O do not disturb foreground applications. Applications like Windows Defender, Automatic Disk Defragmenter and <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search (during indexing) already use this feature. Windows Media Player 11 also supports this technology to offer glitch-free multimedia playback.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} via a Windows Taskbar mounted deskbar. It provides a text field to type the query {{and the results}} are presented in a flyout pane. It also integrates as a Windows Explorer window. On selecting a file in the Explorer window, a preview of the file is shown in the right hand side of the window, without opening the application which created the file. Web searches can be initiated from both interfaces, but that will open the browser to search the terms using the default search engine.|$|E

25|$|Windows Search is the indexed search {{platform}} in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, {{and offers a}} superset of the features provided by <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Search, while being API compatible with it. Unlike WDS, it can seamlessly search indexed as well as non-indexed locations – for indexed locations the index is used and for non-indexed locations, the property handlers and IFilters are invoked on the fly as the search is being performed. This allows for more consistent results, though {{at the cost of}} searching speed over non-indexed locations. Windows Search uses Group Policy for centralized management.|$|E
25|$|The first {{versions}} of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were actually just programs run from MS-DOS which then {{took over the}} screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current {{versions of}} Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, {{such as the ability}} to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when plugged in instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.|$|E
25|$|Windows 95 was {{followed}} up {{with the release of}} Windows 98 on June 25, 1998, which introduced the Windows Driver Model, support for USB composite devices, support for ACPI, hibernation, and support for multi-monitor configurations. Windows 98 also included integration with Internet Explorer 4 through Active Desktop and other aspects of the <b>Windows</b> <b>Desktop</b> Update (a series of enhancements to the Explorer shell which were also made available for Windows 95). In May 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, an updated version of Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added Internet Explorer 5.0 and Windows Media Player 6.2 amongst other upgrades. Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002, and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.|$|E
