The annual asymmetric component in N 2 density corresponds to an increase of about 400 K between <b>winter</b> and summer <b>poles,</b> which is about a factor of three greater than in the Jacchia model. However, the corresponding oxygen component at satellite altitudes reflects an increase between winter and summer comparable to that in the Jacchia model; this implies that at 120 km atomic oxygen increases by more than a factor of two between summer and <b>winter</b> <b>poles.</b> The amplitude of the symmetric semiannual component in N 2 is larger at the poles than the equator. At the poles, the N 2 variation corresponds to a temperature decrease of about 70 K from mid-April to mid-July.

50|$|Another {{feature is}} that the summer {{mesopause}} is cooler than the winter (sometimes {{referred to as the}} mesopause anomaly). It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the summer pole and downwelling at the <b>winter</b> <b>pole.</b> Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer mesopause and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter mesopause. In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to gravity wave dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east-west flow, resulting in a small north-south circulation.|$|E

40|$|Regions of very low, rapidly varying {{brightness}} temperatures {{have been}} observed near the martian <b>winter</b> <b>poles</b> by several spacecraft. One possibility is that the CO 2 condensation temperature is lowered by depletion of CO 2 {{in the air at}} the surface. We estimate the rate at which this low-molecular-weight air would disperse into the high-molecular-weight air above and show that it is generally faster than the rate of supply. This dispersal could be prevented if there is a strong temperature inversion (warm air above colder air) near the surface. Without an inversion, the entire atmospheric column could become depleted. However, depleted columns {{take a long time to}} form, and they are inconsistent with the rapid fluctuations in the cold spot locations and temperatures. Because low-altitude temperature inversions cannot be ruled out by existing observations, CO 2 depletion is still a viable explanation for the martian cold spots...|$|R

30|$|Large wave amplitudes lead to wave {{breaking}} and hence momentum deposition. This, in turn, produces body forces that drive large scale residual circulations. In the winter stratosphere (approximately 20 to 60 km), planetary wave breaking drives a residual circulation from the equator to the <b>winter</b> <b>pole,</b> {{while in the}} mesosphere, gravity wave {{breaking and}} dissipation drives a circulation from the summer to <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> (e.g. see Andrews et al. 1987). The combined effects of these large-scale circulation patterns, usually {{referred to as the}} Brewer-Dobson circulation, can be profound. For example, the pole-to-pole circulation at the mesopause (approximately 85 to 90 km) leads to rising (descending) motions over the summer (<b>winter)</b> <b>pole</b> with associated adiabatic cooling (heating). These vertical motions produce temperatures that are more than 50 K cooler or warmer than would be expected by radiative equilibrium alone. In fact the summer polar mesopause is the coldest place in the Earth’s environment with temperatures of 120 K or lower. Temperatures below about 130 K are sufficient for ice particles to form, leading to a phenomena such as noctilucent clouds.|$|E

When the eddy viscosity is greater than 1 million sq cm/sec, the boundary layer extends far up into the atmosphere, making the geostrophic approximation invalid for the bulk of the atmosphere. A temperature model for Mars was used which was based on Mariner 9 infrared spectral data with a 30 % increase in the depth averaged temperature from the <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> to the subsolar point.

Prominent features such as the double peaked uplift structure in the April-May SAMS data are clearly evident in all three CLAES tracers. Contours of SAMS CH 4 and N 2 O occur mostly at higher pressures than in the CLAES data, presumably due in part to increased tropospheric content of these gases, and/or perhaps some dynamic difference associated with the 15 years time difference between the data sets. The CLAES F 12 are the first long time base global data sets. These show more tropical uplift than climatology or models. This might suggest a somewhat shorter lifetime of F 12 in the stratosphere than is currently accepted...|$|R

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is assumed to}} be driven by a polar symmetric temperature field. The surface pressure gradient exhibits a latitudinal dependence opposite that of the depth-averaged temperature. The magnitude of the gradient is dependent upon the depth of the boundary layer, which depends upon the eddy viscosity, the boundary conditions imposed at the surface, and upon the temperature lapse rate. Using a temperature model for Mars based on Mariner 9 infrared spectral data with a 30 % increase in the depth-averaged temperature from the <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> to the subsolar point, the increase in surface pressure from the subsolar point to the <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> was calculated as a function of eddy viscosity with no-slip conditions imposed at the surface. The meridional cellular flow rate is correlated with the eddy viscosity, causing a complete overturning of the atmosphere in tens of days for an eddy viscosity of. 1 billion sq cm/sec and in hundreds of days for 1 million sq cm/sec. The implication of this overturning in the dust storm observed during {{the early part of the}} Mariner 9 mission is discussed briefly...|$|E

40|$|Titan's {{atmosphere}} {{has provided}} an interesting study in contrasts and similarities with Earth's. While both have N_ 2 {{as the dominant}} constituent and comparable surface pressures ∼ 1 bar, Titan's next most abundant molecule is CH_ 4, not O_ 2, and the dissociative breakup of CH_ 4 and N_ 2 by sunlight and electron impact leads to a suite of hydrocarbons and nitriles, and ultimately the photochemical smog that enshrouds the moon. In addition, with a 15. 95 -day period, Titan is a slow rotator compared to Earth. While the mean zonal terrestrial winds are geostrophic, Titan's are mostly cyclostrophic, whipping around the moon {{in as little as}} 1 day. Despite the different dynamical regime, Titan's winter stratosphere exhibits several characteristics that should be familiar to terrestrial meteorologists. The cold <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> near the 1 -mbar level is circumscribed by strong winds (up to 190 m/s) that act as a barrier to mixing with airmasses at lower latitudes. There is evidence of enhancement of several organic species over the <b>winter</b> <b>pole,</b> indicating subsidence. The adiabatic heating associated with this subsidence gives rise to a warm anomaly at the 0. 01 -mbar level, raising the stratopause two scale heights above its location at equatorial latitudes. Condensate ices have been detected in Titan's lower stratosphere within the winter polar vortex from infrared spectra. Although not always unambiguously identified, their spatial distribution exhibits a sharp gradient, decreasing precipitously across the vortex away from the <b>winter</b> <b>pole.</b> The interesting question of whether there is important heterogeneous chemistry occurring within the polar vortex, analogous to that occurring in the terrestrial polar stratospheric clouds in the ozone holes, has not been addressed. The breakup of Titan's winter polar vortex has not yet been observed. On Earth, the polar vortex is nonlinearly disrupted by interaction with large-amplitude planetary waves. Large-scale waves have not been identified in Titan's atmosphere, so the decay of its polar vortex may be more gradual than on Earth. Observations from an extended Cassini mission into late northern spring should provide critical data indicating whether the vortex goes away with a bang or just fades away...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} {{dynamics of}} the Martian upper thermosphere near the exobase (~ 160 - 200 km) are still relatively poorly constrained by data. Electron reflectometry (ER) provides a way to derive, from electron loss cones, neutral mass densities at these altitudes in the night hemisphere. Because the Mars Global Surveyor Electron Reflectometer was not designed for this purpose, uncertainties in individual measurements are large and thus upper thermospheric variability can be characterized only on time scales of weeks or longer. Density measurements are presented at 2 A. M. local time and 185 km altitude, from April 1999 until November 2006, spanning ~ 4 Martian years. We observe a weaker correlation with lower atmospheric dust activity than {{is seen in the}} lower thermosphere and a weaker correlation with solar EUV flux than is observed in the dayside exosphere. Seasonally repeating features are (1) overall expansion/contraction of the nighttime thermosphere with heliocentric distance, (2) much lower densities at the aphelion <b>winter</b> <b>pole</b> compared to the perihelion <b>winter</b> <b>pole,</b> and (3) a short-lived local density maximum at aphelion in the southern hemisphere. Interannual differences are also observed; in particular, the interval of low densities in the southern winter occurs progressively later as solar EUV flux decreases from solar maximum to solar minimum. Results are compared with predictions from the Mars Thermosphere General Circulation Model and LMD Mars Global Circulation atmospheric model frameworks for Ls = 90 °- 180 °, which generally underestimate and overestimate neutral densities, respectively.

40|$|The first {{detection}} in {{the atmosphere}} of Mars of the night side O 2 (a 1 Δg) emission at 1. 27 mm from limb observations of the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board Mars Express was reported earlier (Bertaux et al., JGR, 2012). The emission, detected in 3 cases out of 40 observations is due to recombination in a downwelling air parcel of O atoms produced by photodissociation of CO 2 on the dayside in the upper atmosphere (O+O+M® O 2 *+M), and not from ozone UV photodissociation, as is often seen on the day side. This emission was also detected with SPICAM/MEX. It {{is similar to the}} strong O 2 Venus nightglow, which traces the transport of thermospheric air from the day side to the night side. However, in the case of Mars, it traces a meridional transport from the summer pole to the <b>winter</b> <b>pole,</b> along a single Hadley's cell, similar to the terrestrial case. This can be explained in the frame of a general circulation model (GCM) of Mars. As predicted by the GCM, all positive observations were obtained at high latitudes, during the winter night or near the equinox. An interesting feature of the model is that it predicts that near both equinoxes, this emission may happen simultaneously at both pole regions, showing that the circulation is then characterized by two Hadley's cells, ascending at equator and downwelling at both poles. The search for such a situation in Mars Express data will be reported. The model is validated, which simulates the large Hadley cell characterizing the meridional circulation, ascending from the summer pole and descending to the <b>winter</b> <b>pole.</b> This new emission is tracing uniquely a downward advection transport mechanism, and therefore its detailed study will provide important constraints on the overall aeronomy and dynamics of Mars...|$|E

40|$|We {{summarize}} recent observations by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer of Saturn, its rings, Titan, and the icy satellites. Limb {{observations of}} Saturn show vertical oscillations of temperatures and zonal-wind shears in the equatorial region {{that may be}} related to a temporal oscillation similar to the terrestrial QBO and Jupiter's QQO. There is also evidence of subsidence at mid-northern latitudes driven by the equatorial activity. Nadir-viewing observations show compact warm spots in the troposphere and stratosphere at both (summer and <b>winter)</b> <b>poles,</b> likely associated with subsidence. Observations of Titan have defined better the characteristics of the northern winter polar vortex, with 190 m/s winds surrounding a cold atmosphere at 1 microbar. The very warm polar stratopause at 10 microbar and the enhanced abundances of organic compounds suggest subsidence within the vortex. Analysis of the zonal structure in temperature indicates that the stratospheric zonal winds rotate about an axis that is displaced approximately 4. 1 deg from the IAU pole. Additional flybys, including a close one in March 2008, continue to characterize the endogenic activity in Enceladus s south polar region. Temperature maps of bright and dark terrains on Iapetus indicate that its ice is approximately stable to sublimation in the bright regions and highly unstable in the dark regions. Thermal mapping of Saturn s rings continues to constrain their composition, and observations at different solar phase angles, spacecraft elevations, solar elevations, and local hour angles have elucidated the effects of ring-particle shadowing and vertical motions on the thermal structure, and revealed the presence of small-scale structure associated with self-gravity wakes...|$|R
