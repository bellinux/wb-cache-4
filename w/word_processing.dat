The results show that other-relevant words are associated with a more negative ERP than possessor-relevant words during 300 - 900 ms whether in the implicit or the explicit memory tests. The N 400 effect is also found in semantic processing of social materials. There is an ERP dissociation of retrieval formats between the implicit and the explicit memory tests during 700 - 900 ms, namely, there is no difference between other-relevant words and possessor-relevant words in the implicit memory while there is a significant difference between them in the explicit memory. Observed through Curry 6. 0, the analysis of neural sources for other-relevant words and possessor-relevant words indicates that they have different locations.

40|$|Recent {{functional}} imaging {{studies have}} referred to a posterior region of the left midfusiform gyrus as the “visual word form area” (VWFA). We review the evidence for this claim and argue that neither the neuropsychological nor neuroimaging data are consistent with a cortical region specialized for visual word form representations. Specifically, there are no reported cases of pure alexia who have deficits limited to visual <b>word</b> form <b>processing</b> and damage limited to the left midfusiform. In addition, we present functional imaging data {{to demonstrate that the}} so-called VWFA is activated by normal subjects during tasks that do not engage visual <b>word</b> form <b>processing</b> such as naming colors, naming pictures, reading Braille, repeating auditory words, and making manual action responses to pictures of meaningless objects. If the midfusiform region has a single function that underlies all these tasks, then it does not correspond to visual <b>word</b> form <b>processing.</b> On the other hand, if the region participates in several functions as defined by its interactions with other cortical areas, then identifying the neural system sustaining visual word form representations requires identification of the set of regions involved. We conclude that {{there is no evidence that}} visual word form representations are subtended by a single patch of neuronal cortex and it is misleading to label the left midfusiform region as the visual word form area. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We present a connectionist model of reading that predicted distinct processing of pre- and post-literacy acquired words. For reading for meaning, words learned prior to literacy were processed more indirectly via phonological representations, whereas for post-literacy acquired <b>words,</b> <b>processing</b> was more direct along the orthography to semantics pathway. This more computationally intensive route was prioritised because indirect phonology to semantics mappings were unavailable. Such an effect was less apparent for naming, because learning direct orthography to phonology mappings is less computationally intensive.

Methods In the present study, we investigated the <b>processing</b> of <b>word</b> stress and vowel quality using an identity matching task with pseudowords. Results In line with previous studies, a bilateral fronto-temporal network comprising the superior temporal gyri extending into the sulci {{as well as}} the inferior frontal gyri was observed for <b>word</b> stress <b>processing.</b> Moreover, we found differences in the superior temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus, bilaterally, for the processing of different stress patterns. For vowel quality processing, our data reveal a substantial contribution of the left intraparietal cortex. All activations were modulated by task demands, yielding different patterns for same and different pairs of stimuli. Conclusions Our results suggest that the left superior temporal gyrus represents a basic system underlying stress processing to which additional structures including the homologous cortex site are recruited with increasing difficulty. </p...|$|R

We examined whether HA differences in visual tasks can also be observed in bilinguals with different language backgrounds. We compared the behavior of three groups in a tachistoscopic English word sequential matching task: English monolinguals (alphabetic monolinguals, A-Ms), bilinguals with an alphabetic-L 1 and English-L 2 (alphabetic-alphabetic bilinguals, AA-Bs), and bilinguals with Chinese-L 1 and English-L 2 (logographic-alphabetic bilinguals, LA-Bs). The results showed AA-Bs had a stronger left hemispheric lateralization than A-Ms and LA-Bs, suggesting different language learning experiences can influence visual <b>words</b> <b>processing.</b> Our computational model could explain this effect, based on a perceptual HA theory; the modeling data suggested this difference {{may be due to}} the differences in both participants’ vocabulary size and word-to-sound mapping between alphabetic and logographic languages. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} multimodal optimization (MMO) methods {{aiming to}} locate multiple optimal (or close to optimal) solutions for an optimization problem. MMO {{is an important}} topic that has practical relevance in problem solving across many fields. Many real-world optimization problems are multimodal by nature - in other <b>words,</b> <b>processing</b> {{in more than one}} mode. There often exist multiple satisfactory solutions. For such an optimization problem, it may be desirable to locate all global optima and/or some local optima that are considered as being satisfactory. MMO has practical relevance to many engineering problems. Optimization methods specifically designed for solving MMOproblems, often called nichingmethods, are predominantly developed from the field of evolutionary computation that belongs to a family of stochastic optimization algorithms (or metaheuristic algorithms), including genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and so on. This class of stochastic optimization algorithms, typically evolutionary algorithms (EAs), have shown to be effective and robust optimization methods for solving difficult optimization problems...|$|R
