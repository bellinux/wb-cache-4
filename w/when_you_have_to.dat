500|$|Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as [...] "by far the world's most popular unsigned band".|$|E
500|$|As Radiohead's six-album {{contract}} with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I {{like the people}} at our record company, but the time is at hand <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask why anyone needs one.

500|$|In early 2004, Usher {{broke up}} with Chilli due to [...] "irreconcilable {{differences}} and because they found {{it almost impossible to}} make compromises." [...] Usher said in an interview: [...] "It's unfortunate <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> let a situation go because it's not working", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact {{broke up with}} Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.|$|E

500|$|In April 1965, McCain led the United States {{invasion}} of the Dominican Republic as commander of Task Force 124, which maintained a military occupation until civil unrest had ended. [...] McCain later said, [...] "Some people condemned this as an 'unwarranted intervention,' but the Communists were all set to move in and take over. People may not love you for being strong <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be, but they respect you for it and learn to behave themselves when you are." [...] He also worked closely with U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States Ellsworth Bunker, who was handling negotiations between local factions. [...] For this operation, McCain was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
500|$|On 27 May 1995 at 4:30 am, VRS {{soldiers}} {{posing as}} French troops captured the UN observation posts {{on both ends}} of the bridge without firing a shot. They wore French uniforms, flak jackets, helmets, and personal weapons and drove a French armoured personnel carrier (APC) – all stolen from UN troops detained outside the city. The Serbs disarmed the 12 peacekeepers on the bridge at gunpoint. Ten were taken to an unknown destination while two remained on the site as human shields. According to Colonel Erik Sandahl, commander of the 4th French Battalion (FREBAT4) which was at that time provided by the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment, [...] "when the Serbs took our soldiers under their control by threat, by dirty tricks, they began to act as terrorists, you cannot support this. You must react. The moment comes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop it. Full stop. And we did." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{had kept}} mementos of Lennon for years, but began {{auctioning}} them off after his death, including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. [...] With her finances in an unsteady state – {{she would say}} in 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I have {{fallen in love with}} have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's final {{progression}} to its heavier sounds {{begins with}} [...] "The Pledge", which for Kyo, uses his full vocal range. [...] "Repetition of Hatred" [...] is another heavy track to the album, which gives a strong {{example of the}} backing vocal aspect, performed by Kaoru, Toshiya and Die, the latter who commented [...] "It's tough sometimes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sing and play your guitar at the same time. Kyo [...] doesn't think about how difficult it can be." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was a {{tough thing}} for me. I kicked two calls {{in the fourth quarter}} and I {{impacted}} the game and as an official you never want to do that. It left me with a lot of sleepless nights and I think about it constantly. I'll go to my grave wishing that I'd been better. I know that I did my best at that time, but it wasn't good enough. When we make mistakes, you got to step up and own them. It's something that all officials have to deal with, but unfortunately <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with it in the Super Bowl it's difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".|$|E

2500|$|After Radiohead's six-album record {{contract}} with EMI {{ended with the}} release of Hail to the Thief (2003), Yorke told Time: [...] "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." [...] In 2006, he called major record labels [...] "stupid little boys' games – especially really high up." [...] In 2007, Radiohead independently released their album In Rainbows as a download for which listeners could choose their price; Yorke said the [...] "most exciting" [...] part of the release was the removal of the barrier between artist and audience.|$|E
2500|$|They {{began working}} more quickly on {{material}} then they ever had. [...] "We write songs in like five minutes now," [...] Maida {{said at the}} time, [...] "The energy's there." [...] For the first time, Mazur {{was included in the}} songwriting process, having not been in the band yet while Gravity was being written. [...] "On this record we really tried to write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to come in with a song, say here it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sit in your rehearsal hall and you wait for that magic to happen, well, it doesn’t always happen right away, but that was the M.O. for this record and it worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for President, Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, [...] "There does come a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take the gloves off and that time is right now." [...] In a campaign appearance on October 4, Palin accused Obama of regarding America as [...] "so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country." [...] The accusation referred to Obama's contacts with Bill Ayers, {{a founder of the}} 1960s radical group called the Weathermen, and a New York Times article describing such contacts. The Obama campaign called the allegation a [...] "smear", citing newspaper commentaries critical of Palin's attack. Obama has condemned the Weathermen's violent actions. The criticism of Obama based on his purported relationship with Ayers was subsequently carried on by McCain himself.|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
2500|$|No, we do {{not love}} humanity; {{but on the other}} hand we are not nearly [...] "German" [...] enough, in the sense in which the word [...] "German" [...] is {{constantly}} being used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and race hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning that now leads the nations of Europe to delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if it were a matter of quarantine. For that we are too open-minded, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too [...] "traveled": we far prefer to live on mountains, apart, [...] "untimely," [...] in past or future centuries, merely in order to keep ourselves from experiencing the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics that are desolating the German spirit by making it vain and that is, moreover, petty politics:—to keep its own creation from immediately falling apart again, is it not finding it necessary to plant it between two deadly hatreds? must it not desire the eternalization of the European system of a lot of petty states? ... We who are homeless are too manifold and mixed racially and in our descent, being [...] "modern men," [...] and consequently do not feel tempted to participate in the mendacious racial self-admiration and racial indecency that parades in Germany today as a sign of a German way of thinking and that is doubly false and obscene among the people of the [...] "historical sense." [...] We are, in one word—and let this be our word of honor!— good Europeans, the heirs of Europe, the rich, oversupplied, but also overly obligated heirs of thousands of years of European spirit: as such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it, and precisely because we have grown out of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were uncompromisingly upright; for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions and position, blood and fatherland. We—do the same. For what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief? No, you know better than that, my friends!
