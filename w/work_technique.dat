40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore and develop methods for describing, {{analysing}} and assessing <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in lifting and patient transfer tasks, and to study how the <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> is related to personal factors and aspects of patient quality and safety. The focus was on <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> features with implications for musculoskeletal load and {{for the development of}} musculoskeletal disorders. <b>Work</b> <b>technique</b> was viewed in two basic elements: method and individual performance. The thesis is based on biomechanical model studies in the laboratory and observational studies in the field. Results from lifting experiments implied that separate variables should be used for descriptions of work methods and task performances. The <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> varied between the subjects {{to a greater extent than}} the individual variability over repetitions of a lift task. Differences between men and women in lifting kinematics were found, e. g. in trunk motion, knee angle ranges and hip-knee inter-joint coordination. An observation instrument for description and a quantitative assessment of <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in videotaped patient transfer tasks was developed, and an overall score with regard to musculoskeletal hazard and safety was calculated. The validity and reliability of the instrument were mostly satisfactory, both when evaluating the agreements between the observations of each item and when evaluating the agreements between the overall scores. Observations of nurses at orthopaedic wards revealed that a variety of strategies were used to perform two patient transfer tasks. Being older, suffering from low back symptoms and being male were associated with a poor <b>work</b> <b>technique.</b> Patients perceptions of safety and comfort when being transferred were related to the <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> of nurses, both regarding the <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> score, and the nurses own subjective assessments of their <b>work</b> <b>technique.</b> In conclusion, inter-individual variations regarding <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in lifting and patient transfers tasks suggest that evaluations of <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> may need to be carried out on an individual level. Evaluations should also consider possible differences in <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> between women and men, younger and older persons, and persons with and without low back symptoms. Finally, the transfer skill of nurses could also be regarded as a matter of quality of care...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} move is an {{important}} part of everyday life. Assisted transfers, at hospitals or at home, can lead to high physical load on the nurse's musculoskeletal system, which in turn could cause musculoskeletal problems. The overall aim of this thesis, comprising five studies, was to develop methods for assessing the nurse's <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in patient transfers tasks, with the focus on the load on the musculoskeletal system, and to evaluate <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> after participation in training programmes. Further aims were to evaluate the patient's safety and comfort in transfer situations, and to describe older people's experiences of transfer situations. In Studies I-II, two observation instruments for assessment of nurses' <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> were developed (Pate and DINO). The tests of validity and reliability for both instruments were acceptable to satisfactory, and the evaluations of <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> showed that they functioned as intended. In Study III, the video observation instrument (Pate) was used. The training programme consisted of two models of learning, traditional groups and quality circles, and was evaluated by using the video observation instrument. The patient rated perceived safety and comfort, while the participants rated their own <b>work</b> <b>technique,</b> comfort and perceived exertion during the transfer, using rating scales. The result showed that immediately after training the participants in both models of learning had improved their <b>work</b> <b>technique,</b> and that both the patient and the nurse perceived the transfer to be more comfortable. There was no difference in the effect of the two models of learning. No reduction of musculoskeletal problems was reported by the participants six months after training. In Study IV, the <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> of nursing students after proficiency training in patient transfer methods was evaluated by using the direct observation instrument (DINO). The results showed that the students improved their <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> after training. Both the patient and the students perceived the transfer to be more comfortable. There was also a positive correlation between the student's <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> and the patient's perceptions of safety and comfort during transfer. Study V focused on the older people's experiences of being assisted in transfers, using a qualitative method with semi-structured interviews. The results showed that older people experienced fear of falling and fear of pain, and thus of endangering the healing process in assisted transfers. The participants considered that this fear depended both on their own inability and on the nurse's lack of knowledge in performing safe patient transfers. This thesis indicates that the instruments showed acceptable to satisfactory reliability and validity; and that the <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> of the participants improved directly after training. Furthermore, patient ratings of perceived safety and comfort increased. Using training programmes in recommended patient transfer methods can be seen as primary prevention, since these programmes make it possible for the nurse to learn <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> that could lead to a decreased load on the musculoskeletal system. For the patient, the nurse's acquired skills could lead to a safer and more comfortable transfer, and to improved quality of care...|$|E

40|$|Keyterms: Cooperative Learning approach, STAD technique, Group <b>Work</b> <b>technique,</b> {{teaching}} grammar. In learning English, grammar is a {{main key}} {{and we always}} find grammar in four skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writ ing. Unfortunately, most the learners are not interested to study grammar because it is considered as the most difficult and boring lesson. In order to overcome the problems, in this study, the writer suggests using Student Teams -Achievement Divisions (STAD) technique as one technique of Cooperative Learning. When using STAD technique, the learners will be more active and challenged to study grammar because {{all members of the}} group will have responsibility for their teammates’ learning as well as their own. Therefore, they do not only have higher motivation to increase their gramma r’s score, but are also expected to build a better interaction with each other. In this study, the writer investigated whether there is any significant difference on the students’ grammar achievement between the students taught using STAD technique and those taught using Group <b>Work</b> <b>technique.</b> Besides that, she also wanted to know whether the students taught using STAD technique have significantly better grammar achievement than those taught using Group Work. This study was a quasi-experimental study employing two groups using pretest-posttest design. To carry out her study, she used two classes of the eighth grade students of YPPI 2 Surabaya as the subjects of her study. Each class was taught by using STAD technique and Group <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in turns. The Statistical Data Analysis proved that there was a significant diffe rence in students’ grammar achievement found between the students taught using STAD technique than those taught using Group <b>work</b> <b>technique.</b> Furthermore, it proven that STAD technique has significantly better grammar achievement than those taught using Group <b>Work</b> <b>technique.</b> Thus, it is suggested for the English teachers to use STAD as the technique when teaching grammar...|$|E

Pd Keywords: improving, the students’ {{speaking}} ability, pair <b>work</b> <b>technique.</b> The {{present research}} was categorized into Classroom Action Research (CAR) applying Pair <b>Work</b> <b>technique.</b> It {{was applied to}} solve the students’ problem in learning especially in speaking class. This research was intended to answer the single question “How can “Pair work” technique improve students’ speaking ability at eight grade of SMPN 2 GondangTulungagung?” The subject {{of the study was}} the VIII G students of SMP N 2 Gondang Tulungagung in the period 2014 / 2015, which involves 28 students. This study applied collaborative classroom action research between the researcher and English teacher. In this study, the researcher conducted two cycles that covered planning, implementation, observation and reflection. Each cycles of this study consisted of two meetings. The instruments of this research were questionnaire, interview guide, observation sheet and field note. The data of this study were the students’ score and the students’ performance during the process of teaching and learning process, which were analyzed descriptively. The criteria of success in this research were if the mean score of students’ ability on language function which consist of four aspects pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, grammar are {{greater than or equal to}} 75, and the students’ participant and activeness in speaking activity and group working. Based on the observation sheet from the analysis of the teaching and learning process in speaking by using pair <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in cycle 1, it was found that most of the students still have low in speaking. Although some of them could get improvement in their score, but the criteria of success have not achieved yet. In conclusion, the implementation of the strategy in cycle 1 is still needed to be revised. Based on the observation sheet from the analysis of the teaching and learning process in speaking by using pair work pair <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> in cycle 2, it was found that most of the students got improvement in speaking. The students were more active and enthusiastic during teaching and learning process. There were four pair works or 8 students who could not achieve the criteria of success. They can not speak the pronunciation well and less of grammar so it makes them could not achieve SKM (Standard of minimum score) so, 20 of the students were success and the criteria of success could be achieved.

Based on the finding of this study, it can be concluded that there was a significant effect of students??? achievement in English grammar after being taught through the use of group <b>work</b> <b>technique.</b> The descriptive analysis proves also that the mean score of students??? achievement in english grammar before applying group <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> is low category. It is indicated the mean mark in pre test is 5. 58 or it was low category. Meanwhile, the mean score of students??? achievement in english grammar after applying Group <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> is high category. It is indicated the mean score in post test was 7. 55 which meant that in high category. So, it can be drawn an evidence that group work as an effective learning technique to student that can be used to improve the students??? achievement in learning grammar particularly in form of past tense for senior high school student. Furthermore, by considering the finding of this study, the researcher suggested to the English teacher since the researcher was proved that group <b>work</b> <b>technique</b> contributed to students??? achievement in grammar mastery, English teacher are highly recomended to impelement this technique to teach grammar as the intentional grammar learning instruction. Grammar {{is one of the}} English language elements which is very important to be mastered in all skill of language such as speaking, reading, and writing. In English learning subject, teacher emphasizes student to be focus best on grammar if they want to master English. However, many students still low in grammar skill. They felt that learning grammar is difficult. Students tend to be passive because of the way teacher brings the material is monotonous. The aim of this paper is to find out the increase of students??? achievement in learning past tense grammar by applying group work. This study used a descriptive quantitative research. The sample of this study was 40 students by using purposive sampling. The instrument of this study was an instructional past tense test that consisted of 40 items. The procedure of collecting data used test distribution and analysis data. The finding showed that students had high achievement in grammar through group work learning.
