5|$|Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. Sima Qian {{and other}} {{traditional}} historians placed {{him as a}} minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC.

Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled The Art of War. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin <b>were</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.|$|E

The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E
