But before Castro leaves, he <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Johnson that somebody will whistle and Johnson must reply to confirm that the place is clear.

In the days that follow, while looking at the {{underside}} of the snow globe, Connie discovers a hidden compartment containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message instructing her not to read the message until their 25th wedding anniversary. As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they {{will find a way to}} move on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E
25|$|In the Matrix, the Agents {{interrogate}} Morpheus in {{an attempt}} to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, the rebel humans' last refuge in the real world. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, who believes that he is not the One, resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists on accompanying him. They rescue Morpheus, and in so doing, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith thwarts Neo's escape. Now surer of himself, Neo fights Smith as a near equal and defeats him, but Smith's nature as an Agent allows him to survive. Neo flees the converging Agents and locates an exit in the hotel from which Trinity had escaped earlier, but Smith shoots him dead. In the real world, machines known as Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, while Trinity <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Neo that the Oracle told her that she would {{fall in love with the}} One, and that Neo cannot be dead because she loves him. She kisses Neo, and he revives, this time with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix in time for the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the attacking Sentinels.|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} Pretty on the Inside {{is most often}} noted for its {{abrasive}} instrumentation and for its sophisticated use of melody buried under arrangements. The album's sonic elements are heavily influenced by Los Angeles hardcore punk as well as New York's no wave scene; many of the tracks are accompanied by overt use of feedback, experimental playing, wah pedals, and use of sampling and interpolation. Rapid sliding techniques and string muting are also heavily present on the album, {{as well as what}} Love and Erlandson describe as [...] "Sonic Youth tunings." [...] Love's vocals range from <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> violent screaming, often in succession with the extreme shifts in speed and volume.|$|E

[...] Mogwai's mix of [...] "Plans" [...] adds an extensive use of echo to the original song, while Nick Zinner's remix of [...] "Compliments" [...] created in Shibuya, Tokyo accentuates Okereke's <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> create vocal effects {{similar to those of}} The Cure's Robert Smith according to Adebe.|$|E
500|$|The Downward Spiral {{features}} {{elements of}} industrial rock, techno, and heavy metal, {{a change from}} the synthpop-influenced Pretty Hate Machine. Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow verse–chorus form, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony (or both). The treatment of metal guitars in Broken is carried over to The Downward Spiral, which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures. The album features {{a wide range of}} textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of the central protagonist. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end, frequently moving from <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> screams. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which features a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played.|$|E
500|$|... "The General Operation" [...] ("L'Opération Générale") : Established by Antoine in 1910, {{it begins}} and ends with three strokes of bell. It is briefly {{announced}} by a dressed member. After meditating in a room {{on the back of}} the temple, a desservant climb to the highest platform, and the dressed follower goes to the other platform. Both are standing and pray for a few minutes to transmit the fluid to the churchgoers. Then, if the reading of the sacred texts is scheduled just after, as it is the case in France, the desservant <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> the dressed follower to perform the reading. Originally Antoine practiced this form of worship only on holidays (except Sundays) and on the 1st and 15th days of each month, before extending it to the first four days of the week. It was in 1932 that the General Operation was performed in all Antoinist temples, and no longer only in the one of Jemeppe; furthermore, on 3 December 1933, Catherine decided that the ritual would be also perform every Sunday.|$|E

500|$|Music critic Henry Pleasants {{observes that}} [...] "Presley has been {{described}} variously as a baritone and a tenor. [...] An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color {{have something to do}} with this divergence of opinion." [...] He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, [...] "from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. [...] Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down." [...] In Pleasants' view, his voice was [...] "variable and unpredictable" [...] at the bottom, [...] "often brilliant" [...] at the top, with the capacity for [...] "full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy". [...] Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as 2¼ octaves, emphasizes that [...] "his voice had an emotional range from tender <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear." [...] Presley was always [...] "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers," [...] writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} the hospital, Peter {{is confronted}} by a little girl, who says she holds the answer to his problem. He talks to the little girl, who runs off. While {{pursuing}} her, Peter encounters a group of men; a woman in red informs him these are alternate versions of himself, from alternate timelines where he never became Spider-Man. The woman in red transforms into the demon Mephisto, who tells Peter he can save Aunt May. As payment, Mephisto wants not Peter's soul, but his marriage to Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane are given until midnight the following night to decide their answer and, after several hours agonizing over the choice, they agree to the deal, as long as knowledge of Peter's secret identity is erased from the world. Mary Jane also <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Mephisto another, unspecified offer in return for Mephisto putting Peter's life back exactly how it was and [...] " [...] him a chance at happiness." [...] Finally, Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the little girl was in fact their future daughter, but she will never exist because of their decision. [...] This future daughter is {{not to be confused with}} May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker (Spider-Girl). [...] May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker is the baby that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had at the end of the Clone Saga from the 1990s and would grow up to be Spider-Girl if Norman Osborn never killed her.|$|E
500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{techniques}} and styles {{can be found}} throughout Nine Inch Nails' catalog. Songs such as [...] "Wish", and [...] "The Day the World Went Away" [...] exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in [...] "Starfuckers, Inc." [...] and [...] "Burn". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in [...] "The Collector", from With Teeth, and concert favorite [...] "March of the Pigs". Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements, and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song [...] "Hurt", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word [...] "I" [...] every time the B/E# dyad is played. [...] "Closer" [...] concludes with a chromatic piano motif: The melody is debuted during the second verse of [...] "Piggy" [...] on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of [...] "Heresy", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout [...] "A Warm Place", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on [...] "The Downward Spiral". On The Fragile, Reznor revisits this technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument, with a transposed harmony, or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire {{second half of the}} three-minute long [...] "The Great Destroyer". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: [...] "guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} musical number, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] / [...] "Someone Like You", was acclaimed as {{its main}} highlight. Raymund Flandez described Rivera's vocals as [...] "electrifying" [...] and [...] "golden". Futterman {{wrote that the}} performance was one of Glee best sequences: [...] "Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks {{from one of the}} year's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment." [...] Votta called it the best performance since the cast's rendition of [...] "Don't Stop Believin' in the season one finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", and stated, [...] "Naya Rivera's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting." [...] Chaney awarded the sequence a [...] "A+" [...] grade: [...] "Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana's outing, which happened in the scene right before this performance, {{and the fact that it}} marked the series's 300th musical performance, this marriage" [...] of the two Adele songs, [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", was [...] "all the more powerful". Moyler asserted that the number was [...] "perfection" [...] and said, [...] "This is why I watch Glee. It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little <b>whispers</b> <b>to</b> Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing 'Someone Like You' as if it was the last song she'll ever sing in her damn life." [...] Cinema Blend's Melissa Duko stated that the show [...] "hit it out of the park" [...] and added that it was her favorite performance of the season. Slezak gave the number an [...] "A+" [...] and wrote, [...] "Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele, and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele's glorious original parts." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named the mash-up one of Glee best performances.|$|E
