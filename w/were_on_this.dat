5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> basic pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was reassigned from Hazen's Brigade to the Middle Department on December 6, 1781. On this date, {{a portion}} of the regiment went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they guarded prisoners taken at Yorktown. They <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> detail for 10 months with prisoners under guard at Lancaster, York and Reading. The most notable prisoner under Hazen's watch during this time was 20-year-old Captain Charles Asgill. On May 3, 1782, upon orders by Washington, he was selected to hang in retaliation for the brutal summary execution of American Captain Joshua Huddy by the British. In November 1782 his life was spared after heartrending correspondence by his family and intervention by the Queen of France.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that it could be {{considered}} against the interest of himself and his class, he campaigned long and hard for repeal of the Corn Laws. The great majority of his contributions in parliament <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> subject. He continued to campaign even after he left parliament. His successor in the Wolverhampton seat was Charles Pelham Villiers, another radical Whig who continued his anti-Corn Law work. The repeal was not achieved until 1846, when the Tory leader, Robert Peel, split his party to force the measure through with Whig support.|$|E

This whale was very curious and active; it swam around a vessel for more than 2 hours, displayed all the aerial actions several times (breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, pec-slapping) alongside the vessel, and the vessel had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following the vessel. Many professional whale photographers <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> tour, {{some of them were}} also on the board when this tour operator during the 2006 sightings.|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. The austerity, shortage of materials and need for rapid building, discouraged the development of innovative design. This was accompanied by the rejection by most architects of traditional forms in favour of [...] "international modernism", characterised by simple outlines, uncluttered internal spaces, absence of colour, and flat roofs. The Catholic Church, whose traditional membership was most affected by the changes in housing, {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone.

Linda and I <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 955, in {{the face}} of an {{impending}} major invasion by Later Zhou's Emperor Shizong, Emperor Yuanzong reengaged Song as a key advisor to plan the defense against Later Zhou forces. [...] Song advocated the strategy of spreading out the Southern Tang forces near the Huai, to try to confuse the Later Zhou forces so that they would not dare to advance deeply into Southern Tang territory, and then cutting off their food supply routes, forcing them to retreat and sue for peace. [...] Emperor Yuanzong, who was fearful of Later Zhou forces, decided to follow Song's strategy. [...] However, Southern Tang suffered repeated defeats, and its main garrison on the Huai, Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), became desperately sieged by Later Zhou. [...] Emperor Yuanzong sent the official Li Deming (李德明) to Emperor Shizong to sue for peace, which Emperor Shizong refused; upon observing how massive the Later Zhou forces <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> mission, however, Li Deming returned to Jinling and advocated ceding all of the Southern Tang lands north of the Yangtze to Later Zhou, which Emperor Shizong indicated that he would be satisfied with. [...] Song spoke against the proposal heavily, however, and Chen (who had since returned to the imperial government as Emperor Yuanzong's chief of staff) and Chen's deputy Li Zhenggu (李徵古) subsequently accused Li Deming of treason. [...] Emperor Yuanzong executed Li Deming, and that, for the time being, ended hopes of a negotiated peace between Southern Tang and Later Zhou.|$|E
