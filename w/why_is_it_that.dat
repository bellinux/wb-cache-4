Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps {{important to note that}} this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E

Her final sniper tally reached fifty-nine confirmed kills (fifty-four, according to other sources), including twelve kills during the Battle of Vilnius, with sixty-two enemies knocked out of action. Domestically her achievements were acknowledged particularly by the war correspondent Ilya Ehrenburg and in the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, which said that Shanina {{was one of the best}} snipers in her unit and that even veteran soldiers were inferior to her in shooting accuracy. Shanina's exploits were also reported in the Western press, particularly in Canadian newspapers, where she was called [...] "the unseen terror of East Prussia". She paid no special attention to the achieved renown, and once wrote that she had been overrated. On 16 January 1945 Shanina wrote in her combat diary: [...] "What I've actually done? No more than I have to as a Soviet person, having stood up to defend the motherland." [...] She also wrote, [...] "The essence of my happiness is fighting for the happiness of others.

[...] Thorne tried to explore the theoretical ridge between the two phenomena. [...] He found out eventually that the gravitational force can overcome all interior pressure only when an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his hoop conjecture, which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference [...] can be spun must be a black hole.|$|E

The paper explains the outcomes of China's labor reforms in a statist perspective. The hypothesis is that, despite labor reforms of 1978 to 1995, due to the limited autonomy of {{the central government}}, China has not successfully formulated and implemented employment reforms. Ideological coherence and organizational unity among the central party-state elites are the preconditions for the autonomy, or more accurately, relative autonomy of central governments. Conflicts and debates among various factions destroy the cohesion {{of the central government}}, weakening the relative autonomy of the central government to act as a coherent entity. ...|$|R

In his view, the Iron Dome allows the various Israeli governments to undertake a [...] "limited (military) operation" [...] and therefore shift discussion away from other topics such as the economic recession and corruption concerns. According to Misgav, the Iron Dome does not only shoot down missiles, it also [...] "shoots {{down some of the}} capacity of Israelis for free thought, [...] it reduces their motivation to ask themselves how and why the present 'round of escalation' has started, who escalated it?

2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Liu Shouwen's acts was in 898, {{at which time}} Liu Rengong was embroiled {{in a dispute over}} salt rights with Lu Yanwei, then the military governor of Yichang. [...] Liu Rengong thus sent Liu Shouwen to attack Yichang's capital Cang Prefecture (滄州). [...] Lu, unable to withstand his attack, abandoned the circuit and fled to Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). [...] Liu Rengong thus took over the three prefectures of Yichang (Cang, Jing (景州, in modern Cangzhou), and De (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) Prefectures) and commissioned Liu Shouwen as the acting military governor. [...] He sent a request to then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong to grant Liu Shouwen banners and rods of a military governor (i.e., to make Liu Shouwen military governor). [...] Emperor Zhaozong initially refused. [...] Liu Rengong, who had then become arrogant and was planning to take over the entire region north of the Yellow River, responded to Emperor Zhaozong's eunuch messenger, [...] "I myself have banners and rods. [...] All I want are the authentic colors from [...] Chang'an. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> I made so many petitions and still do not receive them? [...] Tell them this!"

2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E

Part of the answer undoubtedly has to do with place. The ambience and atmosphere, coupled with the history and heritage of Brazilian football seemed to impact on the players (arguably in a negative way for the local team). This, albeit, over simplistic example, illustrates well the invisible connections that influence how sport tourists (in all their guises) feel, perform and behave in designated areas primarily designed for sport...|$|R

40|$|The Rand Revolt, the {{culmination}} of major strikes by white workers, was a pivotal event in South African history. More than 200 lives were lost, the workers and their unions were crushed, and an era of working-class militancy was brought, abruptly, to a close. Defeat led, in March 1924, {{to the passage of}} an Industrial Conciliation Act that further bureaucratized the mainly white unions and institutional-ized a deep divide between these organizations and African workers. It also, however, produced a reaction against the prime minister, General Smuts, who was removed from office in the general election of June 1924. For historians, the revolt, and the strikes preceding it, present an enigma. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> whites, a relatively well-paid elite, were so militant, whilst the majority of the workforce, poorly-paid Africans, did not strike at all?
