5|$|Ebla's first kingdom is {{an example}} of early Syrian {{centralized}} states, and {{is considered one of the}} earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> it the first-recorded world power. Ebla's discovery changed the former view of Syria's history as a bridge between Mesopotamia and Egypt; it proved the region was a center of civilization in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E
50|$|During August, 1864, Poindexter {{was forced}} to leave his home fearing both the wrath of Unionists <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> him a bushwacker and Southern sympathizers <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> him a traitor. He sought the {{protection}} of Union authorities from both threats.|$|R

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|During the mid nineties, Moran co-founded {{and later}} co-chaired the New Democrat Coalition, a {{coalition}} of Democratic lawmakers <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> themselves to be moderates with regard to commerce, budgeting, and economic legislation, but vote as liberals on social issues. Moran was {{also a member of}} the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance progressive issues and opinions. He joined the caucus prior to the 111th Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
50|$|The jurist Wasil ibn Ata (700-748 CE) {{submitted}} that a fasiq {{remained a}} member of Muslim society, so retained rights to life and property though he could not hold a religious position. This opinion set him at odds with Mu'tazilite jurists <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> a fasiq to be a munafiq (hypocrite), and the Kharijites <b>who</b> <b>considered</b> the fasiq a kafir.|$|R

5|$|The revisionist {{tradition}} {{continues to}} the present time, through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the military aspects of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. Adding to the volume of material are groups of international admirers <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 has {{received}} universal acclaim from modern critics <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the title {{to be one}} of the best games of all time. Edge considered Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo's standout title of 1989, and commented that its success outshone the first Super Mario Bros.s sales milestone; the first title sold 40million copies but was bundled with the NES. They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. Allgame's Skyler Miller praised the game's level design, graphics, music, and nonlinearity. Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its re-release on the Game Boy Advance system. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction. Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game made. GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre, Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} Gotham City where Batman {{attempts}} to thwart a crime {{but he is}} being pursued by the police force <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> him a villain. In Metropolis Superman {{is seen as a}} hero as he rescues a sinking passenger boat. Lex Luthor, head of LuthorCorp, is allying himself with Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov who is mining and experimenting with kryptonite in Siberia. Luthor intends to stoke fears of an alien invasion and sell anti-alien defenses to world governments. What appears to be an alien spacecraft flies over United States airspace and is confronted by the air force and Superman, but is ultimately stopped by LutherCorp airplanes. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter-ego, discovers that Lex Luthor is blackmailing members of Wayne Enterprises' board of directors to steal technology designs, allowing him to beat Wayne Enterprises on military contracts. As Batman, Wayne infiltrates Luthor's mansion to gather evidence but also steals Luthor's sample of kryptonite which sets off alarms. Superman and Batman confront each other, suspicious of the other's motives, but both flee as security forces respond to the alarms. Wayne turns his board of directors into double agents, having them give faulty technology to Luthor. To demonstrate his defensive capabilities, Luthor has Ceridov launch nuclear missiles from Russia to the US but Luthor's faulty systems fail and Superman stops the missiles.|$|E

25|$|The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs {{contain a}} {{substantial}} amount of prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah. From a Christian perspective, a number of statements can be associated with events in the life of Jesus. Many consider this significant since several of the books are thought to predate Jesus. This opinion, first propagated by Bacon in his Opus Majus, is hardly defended in modern scholarship, where all passages that clearly refer to Jesus are either considered Christian interpolations (by those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the author to be Jewish) or Christian writings (by those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the author to be Christian).|$|E

25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and {{behavior may be}} due to social stereotypes making people with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave in certain ways, without any biological link between the genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> them to be biological than by those <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number of}} minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E
