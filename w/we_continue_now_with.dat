We reuse Kleinberg’s [1] algorithm from Lecture 15. Algorithm: At each step, select an edge that gets you closest to the destination. Proof: In order to show that this algorithm takes O(log n) steps, we will divide it into phases. We {{will say that the}} algorithm is in phase j if the distance between the current vertex u, and the destination vertex t, is in the range (2 j, 2 j+ 1] as shown in Figure 1. Thus, the expected running time is equal to the expected number of phases, which is O(log n), multiplied by the expected time spent in each phase. Figure 1 : Escape from phase j into phase j + 1. First recall that for small world graphs we have P (u → v) ∝ d −r (u, v) or, equivalently for r = 2 : P (u → v) = where the denominator is a normalizing factor. d− 2 (u, v) w̸=u d− 2 (u, w...|$|E
40|$|Verifying systems using net unfoldings to {{represent}} the state space is a process containing two steps: generation of the unfolding and reasoning about the unfolding. In a recent paper [AIN 00] we generalized the notion of unfoldings to unbounded Petri nets and showed how to capture a symbolic representation of the state space of these nets, thus completing {{the first of the}} two steps discussed above. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> our experimentation and show how to reason with the unfolding obtained. In particular, we show how to use a SAT-solver to solve the coverability problem for unbounded Petri nets. The results of our experiments show that the use of unfoldings, in spite of the two-step process, has better time and space characteristics than an implementation that does not use unfoldings. In effect, we provide the first evidence for the conjecture that the two step process based on unfoldings could be better than a single step verification process that considers all interleavings...|$|R

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself. Traditional crystal sets use half-wave rectifiers. As AM signals have a modulation factor of only 30% by voltage at peaks, no more than 9% of received signal power (...) is actual audio information, and 91% is just rectified DC voltage. Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into sound energy. Some earlier attempts include a one-transistor amplifier in 1966. Sometimes efforts to recover this power are confused with other efforts to produce a more efficient detection.

The measurements of quasi-free reactions off the neutron include the observation of a narrow structure, of as yet unknown nature, in the excitation function of eta production off the neutron. These experiments <b>continue</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> the measurement of single and double polarization observables.

40|$|This is a {{pilot study}} to {{investigate}} icing on wings of wind power turbines. In this report we present and discuss various ways and means to either heat water droplets or melt ice when formed {{on the wings of}} wind turbines. The situation is different from icing on wings of airplanes in that (1) the wings of wind turbines spend all of their time in the atmosphere where the risk of icing is highest and (2) the speed of wing to air varies over the wing where it is constant for an airplane. The form of the wind turbine wings also varies from tip to centre, to compensate for the varying relative air speed. We have concentrated on icing conditions at temperatures - 10 °C – 0 °C and droplet sizes of 1 - 10 μm. Icing occurs also at much lower temperatures, but this will probably be because of direct freezing of water vapour to ice. This is presently outside the scope of our pilot project report. We conclude that The form of the wing, especially on the contact area may be crucial to the icing problem. Also the nano-metric structure of the wing surface can probably be designed so that the water droplets have a minimized contact area to the wing. Our pilot investigation also suggests the following: Microwaves are much too inefficient to heat water or melt ice. Direct microwave devices should therefore not be developed. Indirect heating with microwaves is possible. Millimeter waves are sufficiently efficient, but the generation is most probably too inefficient to be of any practical use. Infrared waves are very efficient to heat water and melt ice and should be investigated. Heat conduction is also efficient and should be pursued. Using microwaves to heat the wing surface which then conduct heat to the water/ice is a very efficient and robust method. Our pre-study suggests that the solution to avoid icing or de-ice wings of wind turbines most probably is not one single technology. The form and surface structure of the wings play important role for icing conditions. Both variables have to be modified depending on the latitude and atmospheric climate. The surface structure also has to be designed to vary over the wing, both along and across to be optimized for the mean conditions at the site. In addition, heating of the impact area, or at least the possibility to heat this, may be important to avoid loss of energy output due to ice. Further research is required. We strongly suggest investigating the water droplet flow over the wing as function of the cross section form, and the contact with the wing surface as function of the surface structure (e. g. Lotus effect). The present report {{is the result of a}} pre-study project. <b>We</b> will <b>now</b> <b>continue</b> <b>with</b> a deeper project which will concentrate on the form and surface structure suggestions which results from our analysis and flow simulations. Denna rapport presenterar resultatet av en förstudie om tekniker för avisning av vindkraftverk. Rapporten presenterar och diskuterar möjliga metoder och tekniker för att antingen värma vattendroppar till över fryspunkten, eller smälta is som har bildats på vingen. Problematiken för vingar på vindkraftverk skiljer sig markant från nedisning av flygplansvingar i att: (1) vingar på vindkraftverk tillbringar all sin tid i den delen av atmosfären där risken för nedisning är som störst; och (2) hastigheten för vingen mot luft varierar med avstånd från rotationscentrum medan den är konstant över vingen på ett flygplan. Formen på vingen på ett vindkraftverk varierar också från toppen in till centrum för att kompensera för variationen av relativ hastighet mot luften. Rapporten koncentreras på isbildning inom temperaturintervallet - 10 °C – 0 °C och droppstorlekar av 1 - 10 μm. Nedisning sker även vid mycket lägre temperaturer, men då sker troligen isbildningen direkt från vattenånga. Vi drar följande slutsatser från vår studie: Formen på vingen, speciellt vid kontaktytan mot gasflödet, kan ha betydelse för nedisning. Nano-strukturen av ytan på vingen kan troligen konstrueras så att vattendropparna får enminimal kontaktyta mot vingen. Vår förstudie visar dessutom: Mikrovågor är alltför ineffektiva för att värma rent vatten eller smälta is. Tekniker för direktstrålning av mikrovågor mot vatten eller is på vingar bör således inte vidare utvecklas. Millimetervågor är tillräckligt effektiva, men generationen av vågor på så höga frekvenser ärtroligen alltför ineffektiv för att detta ska vara en möjlig väg framåt.

En robust och effektiv metod kan vara attvärma vingytan med mikrovågor så att kontakten mot den varma ytan smälter isen. Vår förstudie visar att problematiken med undvikande av isbildning på, eller avisning av, vindkraftsverk inte har sitt svar i en enda teknik. Formen på vingen och strukturen på dess yta kan spela en viktig roll i förhållandena för isbildning. Båda dessa variabler kan behöva varieras beroende på latitud och atmosfäriskt klimat. Ytstrukturen måste troligen också variera över vingytan, både längs med vingen och tvärs, för att optimera för de lokala förhållandena. Dessutom kan smältning av is medelst värmning av vingytan vara en viktig extra möjlighet för att undvika effektförluster.
