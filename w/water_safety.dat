5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about <b>water</b> <b>safety,</b> and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{classification}} of national level poverty-stricken counties, the intra-classification differences of different indicators’ contributions are larger than those of other classes, except for the housing indicator; the inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those}} of other classes, except for the two indicators of drinking <b>water’s</b> <b>safety</b> and sanitary facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is quite larger among different poverty level of counties, while the internal difference among those counties at the same poverty level is comparatively smaller. In {{terms of the}} classification of minority autonomous counties, the intra-classification differences of indicators’ contributions are larger than those of historic revolutionary base classes, except for the indicators of adult’s illiteracy, drinking <b>water’s</b> <b>safety</b> and sanitary facilities. The inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those of}} other classes, except for drinking <b>water’s</b> <b>safety</b> and sanitary facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is greater between minority autonomous counties and non-minority autonomous counties, while the internal difference of the same classes is comparatively smaller. Overall, the poverty contributions of the two indicators, i.e., housing and adults’ illiteracy, show bigger intra-classification differences, while those of the other two indicators, drinking water’s availability and sanitary facilities, show bigger difference not only in intra-classification, but also in inter-classification. Which indicates there exist significant difference among those counties from three different classifications, as well as from the same classification, when regarding to the poverty degree of two indicators of drinking water’s availability and sanitary facilities.|$|R

2500|$|On another occasion, Crowe donated $200,000 to a {{struggling}} primary school {{near his home}} in rural Australia. The money went towards an $800,000 project to construct a swimming pool at the school. Crowe's sympathies were sparked when a pupil drowned at the nearby Coffs Harbour beach in 2001, and he believes the pool will help students become better swimmers and improve their knowledge of <b>water</b> <b>safety.</b> At the opening ceremony he dove into the pool fully clothed as soon as the venue was declared open.

2500|$|Service {{quality is}} highly {{variable}} and data is sketchy. In 2003, 63% of municipalities {{were not able}} to say if they met drinking water quality standards or not. Water supply to 37% of households was interrupted for at least one day in 2003. Customers did not and often still do not trust that drinking water quality is adequate. This is why the Department of Water Affairs introduced in 2008 a so-called [...] "blue drop" [...] incentive-based water quality regulation strategy. Under the strategy municipal service providers are certified with a [...] "blue drop" [...] if they fulfill certain requirements. These include not only compliance with water quality standards, but also the existence of a <b>water</b> <b>safety</b> plan, process controlling and the credibility of sample results, among others.|$|E

2500|$|The Walkerton tragedy {{had serious}} ramifications for Harris's government. [...] David Peterson later {{acknowledged}} {{that it could have}} happened under any Premier's watch, and it was often noted that Koebel's lying and falsification of records had gone unnoticed by governments of different political stripes. [...] Harris's handling of the tragedy was also criticized, as he initially attempted to place some of the blame on previous Liberal and NDP governments. Harris called a public inquiry, headed by Justice Dennis O'Connor, which later noted that in addition to Stan Koebel's failure to properly monitor and treat the water supply, deregulation of water quality testing and cuts to the Ministry of the Environment were contributing factors. The inquest into the tragedy found that the government cuts to inspection services and their privatisation had created a situation in which future <b>water</b> <b>safety</b> could not be guaranteed. [...] The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place.|$|E
2500|$|The summary Selwyn District Council report, by Nick Boyes of Resource Management Group Ltd, {{recommended}} declining {{both the}} Notice of Requirement and the applications for land use consents.

2500|$|According to this {{indicator}} on improved water sources, the MDG was met in 2010, {{five years}} ahead of schedule. Over 2 billion more people used improved drinking water sources in 2010 than did in 1990. However, the job is far from finished. 780 million people are still without improved sources of drinking water, and many more still lack safe drinking water: complete information about drinking <b>water</b> <b>safety</b> is not yet available for global monitoring of safe drinking water. Estimates suggest that at least 25% of improved sources contain fecal contamination and an estimated 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water which suffers from fecal contamination. The quality of these sources vary over time and are typically of worse quality in the wet season. Continued efforts [...] are needed to reduce urban-rural disparities and inequities associated with poverty; to dramatically increase coverage in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania; to promote global monitoring of drinking water quality; and {{to look beyond the}} MDG target towards universal coverage.|$|E
