5|$|In Bird of Paradise, a <b>white</b> <b>American</b> man (Joel McCrea) {{enjoys a}} torrid {{affair with a}} Polynesian princess (Dolores del Río).

5|$|The {{structure}} and biology {{of the genus}} Crucibulum was better known by the mid-19th century, when the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne published a monograph on the bird's nest fungi. Subsequently, monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. <b>White</b> (<b>American</b> species),Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906, Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 (New Zealand species), and Harold J. Brodie in 1975.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority <b>white</b> <b>American</b> population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E

50|$|A December 2014 {{opinion poll}} by Washington Post-ABC News showed a {{majority}} of blacks {{do not believe that}} they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system.

50|$|DNA {{analysis}} shows varied results regarding non-European ancestry in self-identified <b>White</b> <b>Americans.</b> A 2002 DNA analysis found that about 30% of self-identified <b>White</b> <b>Americans</b> have recent sub-Saharan African ancestry.

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. <b>White</b> <b>American</b> women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. <b>White</b> <b>American</b> audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While {{she and her husband were}} travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E
5|$|In September {{questions}} were asked in the House of Commons about the incident, by which time Constantine had decided to take legal action. In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court. Although there was no law against racial discrimination in Britain at the time, Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him. Constantine informed the court that {{the attitude of the}} hotel changed between his booking and arrival, owing to the presence of <b>white</b> <b>American</b> servicemen. The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily. The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used. After two days of evidence, the judge found in Constantine's favour, rejecting the defence's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation. Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas, Constantine was vindicated. He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised the issue of racism in the public eye; the case was widely reported in the press, and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government.|$|E

50|$|DNA {{analysis}} on <b>White</b> <b>Americans</b> by geneticist Mark D. Shriver showed {{an average of}} 0.7% Sub-Saharan African admixture and 3.2% Native American admixture.

40|$|Objective.   Emerging {{comparative}} literature documents significant racial {{differences in the}} chronic pain experience in terms of physical, psychological, and social well-being. However, the intrarace differences of chronic pain among black <b>Americans</b> and <b>white</b> <b>Americans</b> has not been extensively investigated. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to examine the potential within-race-group differential effects and the psychosocial aspects of chronic pain in black and <b>white</b> <b>Americans</b> across age groups. Design.   A retrospective study of patients presenting for chronic pain management. Setting.   A tertiary care multidisciplinary pain center. Patients.   Patients were younger (< 50 [*]years) (mean[*]±[*]SD: 36. 7 [*]±[*] 8. 4) and older (≥ 50 [*]years) (60 [*]±[*] 9. 3) black Americans (N[*]=[*] 525), and younger (36. 6 [*]±[*] 8. 1) and older (63 [*]±[*] 9. 8) <b>white</b> <b>Americans</b> (N[*]=[*] 5, 298). Outcome Measures.   Participant s were measured on depressive symptoms, social functioning, pain intensity, pain-related disability, and physical comorbidities. Results.   Younger black Americans reported more depressive symptoms, pain intensity, and were less successful at coping with pain when compared to older black Americans. Similar within-group differences were also observed for reports of depressive symptoms, pain intensity, and coping abilities among <b>white</b> <b>Americans.</b> Results further showed that younger <b>white</b> <b>Americans</b> also experienced more symptoms related to post-traumatic distress than older <b>white</b> <b>Americans.</b> Conclusion.   Examining within-race-group variability suggests that chronic pain differentially affects the quality of life and health status of black <b>Americans</b> and <b>white</b> <b>Americans</b> across age groups. This study emphasizes the need for further chronic pain studies examining pain indicators within defined racial and ethnic groups...|$|R
