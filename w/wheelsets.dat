40|$|Purpose. The work {{is devoted}} to the study of {{horizontal}} oscillation and the assessment of the motion stability of a single <b>wheelset</b> with independent wheel rotation, and to the comparison of stability indicators of the typical <b>wheelset</b> and the <b>wheelset</b> with independent wheel rotation.

To achieve this purpose we used the methods of mathematical simulation of railway rolling stock dynamics, as well as the linear algebra methods to assess the stability of solutions of the linear homogeneous differential equations. Findings. To solve the set task the design model of a single <b>wheelset</b> with independent wheel rotation was created. The <b>wheelset</b> is not a single solid body; each of the <b>wheelset</b> axles has a surplus degree of freedom. Thus, we obtained the system with 4 degrees of freedom. The design model allowed to obtain the system of linear homogeneous differential equations describing the oscillations of the represented <b>wheelset</b> in a horizontal plane on a straight track section. On the basis of the computer modeling were calculated the eigenvalues of the differential equation system coefficients and the asymptotic stability analysis of the <b>wheelset</b> motion with independent wheel rotation. The increment and the frequency of fluctuations were compared with similar indicators for the standard <b>wheelset.</b> The authors also discussed non-oscillatory forms of the <b>wheelset</b> motion and the issues of <b>wheelset</b> self-centering on the track. Originality. The result of the work is the mathematical model of the sinuous movement of a single <b>wheelset,</b> in two-dimensional formulation, with independent wheel rotation and the estimate of the dynamic indices during its motion on a straight track section without any irregularities. There were also proposed the ways to ensure the self-centering on the track of the <b>wheelset</b> with independent wheel rotation. Practical value.

The penalty to be paid for the virtual elimination of hunting is a straight track, with an attendant right-of-way problem and incompatibility with legacy infrastructure.|$|E

Originally intended to replace the OMO cars which were suffering from metal fatigue, ten were ordered. However, due to cost cutting only seven were built for Blackpool Transport, with GEC's 648 later joining the fleet.

Its all over advert has been stripped away and it is intended that it will be repainted into a fictional 1920s style red, teak and white livery. Two of the sold cars are based at outside locations: 643 is used as a classroom at Brooke School in Rugby, 644 is stored at Farmer Parrs Animal World in Fleetwood. 645 was stored at Windy Harbour Holiday Park in Singleton near Blackpool and moved back to Rigby Road depot for continued storage on the 27 July 2017.

30|$|With further {{increasing}} in running speed of newer high-speed EMUs (electric multiple units), higher demand for <b>wheelset</b> dynamic balance is required. In order {{to study the}} influence of the dynamic unbalance of <b>wheelset</b> on the stability, ride quality, and curving performance for a high-speed car, a detailed dynamic model of a high-speed EMU car is established using the software SIMPACK. The analysis results indicate that the dynamic unbalance of the <b>wheelset</b> significantly influences the dynamic performance of the high-speed car. The increase in dynamic unbalance of the <b>wheelset</b> will decrease the hunting critical speed, worsen the vertical ride quality, and increase the <b>wheelset</b> lateral force, derailment coefficient, and wheel unloading ratio. Therefore, in order to improve the stability, ride quality, and running safety of high-speed car, the values of dynamic unbalance of <b>wheelset</b> should be strictly controlled in manufacturing, and periodically monitored in operation.|$|R

40|$|This project {{presents}} the dynamic modelling {{and control of}} railway vehicle active suspension systems. The vehicle types selected for this study are the two-axle and bogie-based railway vehicle. The performances of the passive and active suspensions are simulated and compared as the vehicle moves on straight and curved track. The input to the system is the curve radius and its corresponding cant angle. The curving performance was evaluated from the lateral and yaw displacement of the <b>wheelset,</b> bogie and vehicle body. The <b>wheelset</b> arrangement for active suspension selected {{in this study is}} the actively-stabilized <b>wheelset</b> with rotary actuator and the <b>wheelset</b> with independently- rotating wheels.

40|$|The {{instability}} {{caused by}} the conical (or profiled) shape of a solid-axle railway <b>wheelset</b> can be overcome by proper design of the vehicle's primary suspension system but is generally difficult {{as some of the}} <b>wheelset</b> parameters, namely the conicity and creep coefficients, are time-varying. To maintain the <b>wheelset</b> stability at high speeds and satisfactory curving performance simultaneously over the whole range of the parameters' variations, the self-tuning linear-quadratic regulator (S-T LQR) for the primary suspension system of a high-speed two-axle railway vehicle has been developed. The objective of the controller was to minimize the lateral displacement of the <b>wheelset</b> relative to track centerline and its yaw angle, on straight and curved tracks. The Continuous-time Least-Absolute Error with Variable Forgetting Factor (C-T LAE+VFF) estimation algorithm has been used to estimate the <b>wheelset</b> parameters before being used in the calculation of the linear quadratic feedback control gain matrix. The simulation results show that the S-T LQR performed better than the fixed-gain LQR for both the conical and profiled <b>wheelset,</b> suggesting that the ability to estimate the time-varying <b>wheelset</b> parameters and use them in the feedback controller design is necessary to produce better primary suspension control performance...|$|R

The inclusion of wheel rotation in the vehicle model is investigated by implementing a structural dynamics model of a rotating <b>wheelset</b> in an existing simulation environment. Calculated wheel–rail contact forces using this comprehensive flexible <b>wheelset</b> model are compared with contact forces based on less detailed, non-rotating <b>wheelset</b> models. Load cases including broad-band wheel–rail excitation due to vertical rail irregularities (rail corrugation) and impact excitation caused by a local deviation from the nominal wheel radius (wheel flat) are considered.
