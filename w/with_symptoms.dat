40|$|Abstract The {{relationships}} of personal resources <b>with</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and psychosocial functioning {{have never been}} tested systematically in a large sample of people with schizophrenia. We applied structural equation models {{to a sample of}} 921 patients with schizophrenia collected in a nationwide Italian study, with the aim to identify, among a large set of personal resources, those that may have an association <b>with</b> <b>symptom</b> severity or psychosocial functioning. Several relevant demographic and clinical variables were considered concurrently. Poor service engagement and poor recovery style, as well as older age and younger age at onset, were related to greater symptom severity and poorer social functioning. Higher resilience and higher education were related to better social functioning only. Poor problem focused coping and internalized stigma, as well as male gender and depression, were related to symptom severity only. The explored variables showed distinctive and partially independent associations <b>with</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and psychosocial functioning. A deeper understanding of these relationships may inform treatment decisions...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the prevalence of endoscopic findings and their association <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> in the community. Methods: A total of 1, 533 inhabitants of two villages {{were invited to participate}} in a cross-sectional survey, and 1, 033 were recruited. Participants underwent a validated dyspepsia questionnaire, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and a 13 C-urea breath test. Results: Endoscopic findings were present in 17. 6 of asymptomatic subjects and in 27. 4 of those <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms.</b> The prevalence of esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus in subjects <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> and without prominent reflux symptoms was 8. 1 and 1. 5, respectively, and was similar to that of asymptomatic subjects (8. 5 and 0. 7, respectively). Esophagitis was significantly associated <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> only in subjects with concomitant prominent reflux symptoms. Peptic ulcer (PU) was present in 8. 8 of subjects <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> without reflux symptoms and similarly in 9. 4 of those <b>with</b> prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> Subjects <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> and concomitant prominent reflux symptoms had an increased risk of having an underlying PU (odds ratio 2. 74, 95 confidence interval 1. 30 - 5. 78). Conclustions: Almost three-quarters of subjects <b>with</b> dyspeptic <b>symptoms</b> do not have endoscopic findings and, in addition, esophagitis may not be the cause of dyspeptic symptoms in subjects without prominent reflux symptoms. PU may be the cause of dyspeptic symptoms in a subgroup of subjects <b>with</b> prominent reflux <b>symptoms.</b> Â© 2010 by the American College of Gastroenterology...|$|R

5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents <b>with.</b> <b>Symptoms</b> are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality of the initial ascent phase.

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated <b>with</b> <b>symptoms</b> of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people <b>with</b> <b>symptoms</b> of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present <b>with</b> <b>symptoms</b> more similar to Parkinson's disease.

40|$|The {{importance}} of psychiatric symptomatology {{for the treatment}} course of alcoholics was analyzed in a long-term outpatient treatment study. Seventy-two patients, 60 men and 12 women, were personally interviewed during treatment and after 3 years. Before treatment psychiatric symptoms were rated according to the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). Women had significantly higher scores than men. Men <b>with</b> many <b>symptoms</b> and women had more psychological benefits from drinking and a more impaired personality structure than men <b>with</b> few <b>symptoms.</b> Men <b>with</b> many <b>symptoms</b> also had {{a lower level of}} social functioning.

Phenazopyridine may help <b>with</b> <b>symptoms.</b> In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E

5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, <b>with</b> <b>symptoms</b> abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E

5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated <b>with</b> <b>symptoms</b> at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
