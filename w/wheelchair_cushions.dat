40|$|Pressure ulcer {{incidence}} {{rates have}} remained constant [1] even though <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushion</b> technologies have advanced. Shear stress {{is recognized as}} {{a risk factor for}} pressure ulcer development [2] and is a focus of many shear reduction technologies incorporated into cushions; however, shear reduction has not been quantified in the literature. This study evaluated 21 commercial <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions</b> using a methodology developed to quantify interface shear stress and calculate overall and local horizontal stiffness values. For statistical analyses, the cushions were grouped by Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes. The general use cushion category (E 2601) resulted in significantly greater interface shear stresses (p<. 001) than all other categories and the adjustable skin protection cushion category (K 0734) resulted in significantly less interface shear stress (p<. 001) than all other categories. Additionally, this study provided evidence that the current horizontal stiffness test methodology (ISO 16840 - 2) [3] provides sufficient information to characterize <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions,</b> but does not directly quantify interface shear stress. Results from the evaluation of commercial <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions</b> provided evidence of materials and technologies that may reduce the risk of pressure ulcers. Based on these results, three prototype cushions were conceptualized and prototyped into a closed-loop control system. The closed-loop control system monitored interface stress amplitude to actively modulate cushion properties. None of the prototypes effectively reduced interface shear stress using the methodology developed for cushion testing. Subcutaneous buttock soft tissues were investigated using a finite element model. Researchers have previously used finite element models [4 - 13]; however, this study improved upon image collection methodology and validation techniques. MR images of one subject were collected in three seated postures and were used to create 3 -D models of the buttock. A non-linear 3 -D finite element model was developed with anatomical geometries using hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive models. Interface pressure, interface shear stress, and soft tissue displacements were used to validate the model. A parametric analysis resulted in a partially validated model that provided subcutaneous stresses and strains for the upright seated posture. The validated model will be used in future studies to evaluate the SCI population and to evaluate commercial and prototype <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pressure relief done by {{a spinal}} cord injured patient is of utmost {{importance}} {{in order to prevent}} pressure sore formation. Some pressure-relieving techniques are described in previous literature, but their effectivity has not yet been deter- mined on different <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Null Hypothesis (H 0) : The null hypothesis (H 0) stated for thi study {{is that there is no}} difference in the effectivity of forward leaning and forward leaning towards the left as pressure relieving techniques for quadriplegic wheelchair users over the differen <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Design: An analytical experimental study design using a convenient sample group of ten complete lesion quadriplegics (C 6 to T 1) was performed at the Physiotherapy Department, University of Pretoria. Method: Interface pressure (in mmHg) over the ischial tuberosities and upper thigh areas was measured using the Talley Oxford Pressure Monitor MKII with a 12 -way matrix cell system.

25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review {{found that}} people who lay on high {{specification}} or high density foam mattresses were 60% less likely to develop new pressure ulcers compared to regular foam mattresses. Sheepskin overlays on top of mattresses were also found to prevent new pressure ulcer formation. There is unclear research on the effectiveness of alternating pressure mattresses. Pressure-redistributive mattresses are used to reduce high values of pressure on prominent or bony areas of the body. There are several important terms used to describe how these support surfaces work. These terms were standardized through the Support Surface Standards Initiative of the NPUAP. Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus mattresses and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped. Methods to standardize the products and evaluate the efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP. For individuals with paralysis, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushion</b> featuring pressure relief components can help prevent pressure wounds.|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{comfort of}} wheelchairs still {{requires}} improvements, since users {{remain on the}} chair {{for as long as}} 12 h a day. Increased sweating makes the skin more susceptible to colonization by fungi and bacteria, and may cause pressure ulcers. In this sense, the microencapsulation of Phase-Change Materials (PCMs) may help to enhance <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushion</b> comfort by regulating heat exchange. This study describes the production of PCM microcapsules and their application in flexible polyurethane foams after expansion, and assesses improvements in heat exchange. Microcapsules with eicosane core coated with melamine-formaldehyde were produced. Eicosane is a thermoregulation agent whose phase-change temperature is near that of the human body’s. Microcapsules were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Then, microcapsules were applied on polyurethane foams by vacuum filtration and high-pressure air gun. Samples were exposed to a heat source and analysed by infrared thermography. The results indicate that thermal load increased in samples treated with microcapsules, especially by pressure air gun, and show {{that it is possible to}} enhance thermal comfort in wheelchair seats.

Methods: Four subjects were asked to sit for three hours on two different pressure-relieving <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Pressure mapping was used to gather data on mean pressure, peak pressure, and number of sensors activated. Subjects also rated the cushions on comfort. Results: There were significant increases in mean pressure with time for both cushions. The Keen cushion activated a significantly greater number of sensors than did the Roho cushion. Comfort tended to decrease with time for both cushions. Conclusion and Discussion: The two cushions have a similar ability to relieve pressure; however, the Keen cushion provides better envelopment. Also, long periods of sitting correlate with increases in interface pressure...|$|E

Testing was performed with two indenters and seven cushions. Conclusion: <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> deform in response to a loaded indenter. The result is a change in the shape of the indenter-cushion interface, which may not be consistent across loading trials. This is influenced by cushion stiffness and the unloaded shape of the cushion. The data suggests that model design influences the pressure redistribution properties of cushions.

The textile is connected to a small central unit embedded onto the wheelchair. This unit (i) analyses in real time the pressures, (ii) estimates the risk for internal over-stresses with the use of a subject-specific Finite Element model of the buttock area, and (iii) alerts the wheelchair user, if necessary. This alert medium has been defined as a result of a utility / utilisability / acceptability study conducted with representative end users. It is based on a tactilo-visual feedback: the tactile modality is used to alarm the person while the visual modality conveys a message about the risk. A paraplegic volunteer was equipped at home with this device during a six months period. Video cameras were installed inside his house in order to be able to correlate the recorded pressure maps with the activity of the person.

40|$|Deep {{tissue injury}} (DTI) is a severe type of {{pressure}} ulcer, in which damage initiates under intact skin, in soft tissues that are mechanically deformed by load-bearing bony prominences. Sitting-acquired DTI typically {{occurs in the}} gluteus muscles that could sustain deformations by the weight-bearing ischial tuberosities (ITs). No clinical method currently exists for measuring internal tissue deformations; so design and selection of <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> are based mostly on meas-uring sitting pressures. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of different commercial cushions on internal soft-tissue deformations under the ITs, using weight-bearing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We specifically compared muscle, superficial fat, and effective (muscle and fat together) tissue deformations while subjects (n = 10) sat on four cushions (two viscoelastic and two foam) and directly on a rigid support. Deformations were maximal in muscle tissue (mean ~ 70 %), twice more the amount than in fat (~ 30 %). Effective soft-tissue deformations were ~ 50 % to ~ 60 %. Although cushions mildly reduced muscle deformations {{in the order of}} 10 %, theoretically, our interpretation suggests that this deformation level adds safe sitting time.

40|$|AbstractThis project {{focused on}} {{identifying}} {{the influence of}} subject characteristics and foam properties on seat contours in order to explain the load transfer between the buttocks and cushion. Seat contours were recorded for 17 people (11 spinal cord injured and six able-bodied individuals). Contour characteristics were represented by maximum contour depth, surface area, and displaced volume. Subject characteristics were represented as intertrochanteric distance, body weight, and lower extremity muscle tone. Two foams with different degrees of stiff-ness (45 - and 55 -pound indentation load deflection [ILD]) were studied. Multiple regression equations were calculated {{for each of the}} three contour characteristics by entering in all three sub-ject attributes. While the equations differ, all six exhibited a significant Multiple R (range: 0. 79 to 0. 92). Each subject characteristic was a significant predictor of at least one contour trait (p< 0. 05). The major difference between the two cushions was the predictive ability of muscle tone. For the stiffer HR 55 foam, muscle tone was the strongest predictor of all contour characteristics. Therefore, some conclusions can be drawn con-cerning the relationship between foam stiffness, tone, and resulting seat contours. These relationships help define the dif-ferences in load transfer as subject and cushion characteristics vary and are important in the design of contoured foam for use as <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Key words: high resiliency foams, seat contours, tissue inter-face pressure, <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Address all correspondence and reprint requests to: Stephen Sprigle, Univer...|$|E

A repeated measures ANOVA for the peak curb drop absorbed power revealed a significant difference in the cushions (p =. 043). The cushions that appeared to perform the best in this testing appear to be the Invacare Pindot and the Varilite Solo.

40|$|Pressure ulcer {{incidence}} {{rates have}} remained constant despite advances in support surface technology. Interface shear stress {{is recognized as}} {{a risk factor for}} pressure ulcer development and is the focus of many shear reduction technologies incorporated into wheelchair cushions; however, shear reduction has not been quantified in the literature.

This study shows that the existing International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16840 - 2 horizontal stiffness measure provides similar information to the new horizontal stiffness measure. The lack of a relationship between interface shear stress and the overall horizontal stiffness measure, however, suggests that a pressure and shear force sensor should be used with the ISO 16840 - 2 horizontal stiffness measure to fully quantify a cushion's ability to reduce interface shear stress at the patient's bony prominences...|$|R

Design Within-subject repeated measures. Setting Rehabilitation center. Participants Wheelchair users with a spinal cord injury or disorder (N= 17). Interventions Participants performed 3 forward leans and 2 sideward leans with different degrees of lean while seated on each of 3 different <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions.</b> Main Outcome Measures IP measured with a custom sensor and blood flow measured with laser Doppler flowmetry were collected at the ischial tuberosity. Results Pressure relief maneuvers had {{a significant main effect}} on the ischial IP (P<. 001); all maneuvers except for the small frontward lean resulted in a significant reduction in IP compared with upright sitting. Blood flow significantly varied across postures (P<. 001) with flow during upright sitting and small forward leans being significantly lower than during the full and intermediate leans in both the forward and sideward directions. Conclusions The results of the study highlight the importance of positioning wheelchair users in a manner that facilitates in-seat movement. Regardless of the cushion being used, the pressure relief maneuvers resulted in very large reductions in IPs and significant increases in buttock blood flow. Only the small frontward lean was shown to be ineffective in reducing pressure or increasing blood flow. Because these pressure relief maneuvers involved postural changes that can occur during functional activities, these pressure relief maneuvers can become a part of volitional pressure relief and functional weight shifts. Therefore, clinical instruction should cover both as a means to impart sitting behaviors that may lead to better tissue health. © 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 25 th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference. 2009. Miami, FL, USA. The International Organization for Standardization defines {{tests that}} {{characterize}} the properties of <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> (ISO 16840 - 2). The impact damping test (IDT) characterizes cushions' abilities to reduce impact loading on tissues and to help maintain postural stability. The ISO test reports the number of rebounds greater than 10 % of the peak impact acceleration and {{the ratio of the}} second to first rebound acceleration {{in order to determine the}} damping properties. We performed IDTs on three different wheelchair cushions: 3 " elastic foam (EF), 3 " viscoelastic foam (VEF), and a 3 " laminar cushion (LC); a viscous fluid bladder on the top of an elastic foam. The LC had two rebounds greater than 10 % of the peak acceleration while the EF and VEF had one. The LC had high-est ratio (0. 48) followed by the EF (0. 29) and the VEF (0. 25). According to ISO, these results indicate that EF and VEF dampen impacts quicker than LC and have superior abilities to help maintain postural stability. Based upon this analysis, three critical issues about the ISO IDT have been identified. The first is the ISO should incorporate impact magnitude in the analysis, since impact loading on tissues is a stated purpose. The second is the ISO should use impact instead of re-bound accelerations. Results show that nonlinear responses are evident in rebounds in all three cushions. The third issue is that oscillation from impact is not a simple second order damped harmonic. Analysis showed that three to five natural frequencies are embedded in the damped harmonic oscillation, so simple ratios of accelerations do not represent the damping properties of cushions. In conclusion, the ISO IDT should utilize impact accelerations and employ more complex analysis to better characterize the damping properties of <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{feasibility}} of the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the lower back muscles for pressure sores prevention in paraplegia. The hypothesis under study is that FES induces a change in the pressure distribution on the contact area during sitting. Tests were conducted on a paraplegic subject (T 5), sitting on a standard <b>wheelchair</b> and <b>cushion.</b> Trunk extensors (mainly the erector spinae) were stimulated using surface electrodes placed on the skin. A pressure mapping system was used to measure the pressure on the sitting surface in four situations: (a) no stimulation; (b) stimulation on one side of the spine only; (c) stimulation on both sides, at different levels; and (d) stimulation at the same level on both sides, during pressure-relief manoeuvres. A session of prolonged stimulation was also conducted. The experimental results show that the stimulation of the erector spinae on one side of the spine can induce a trunk rotation on the sagittal plane, which causes a change in the pressure distribution. A decrease of pressure on the side opposite to the stimulation was recorded. The phenomenon is intensified when different levels of stimulation are applied to the two sides, and such change can be sustained for a considerable time (around 5 minutes). The stimulation did not induce changes during pressure-relief manoeuvres. Finally, from this research we can conclude that the stimulation of the trunk extensors can be a useful tool for pressure sores prevention, and can potentially be used in a routine for pressure sores prevention based on periodical weight shifts...|$|R
40|$|Despite great {{advances}} {{in the field of}} ergonomics, its integration into computer-aided product design remains a great need, especially during conceptual design. In order that a product be designed for safety and comfort, it is essential that pertinent ergonomic principles be imposed as design constraints during design conceptualization. Further, it is vital that these constraints be propagated to downstream design activities {{so that they can be}} considered along with other design constraints such as manufacturing and assembly, in deriving design alternatives and subsequently in determining the outcome of the final product. This should enable the design of safer and more comfortable products, minimize design iterations that often result from ergonomic violations, reduce design cycle time and hence minimize product lifecycle cost. The objective of this dissertation was to provide an efficient and effective method for integrating ergonomics into computer aided product design. To achieve this objective, first, the principles of ergonomics in relation to product design were stated and then represented algebraically so that these principles can easily be integrated into computer aided design. Next, discrete products were categorized into twelve classes on the basis of the function(s) users would perform on them. Ergonomic principles constraining each product class were then provided. As such, by means of this categorization a designer should easily acquire ergonomic rules that constrain a design within a product category. Thirdly, to make ergonomic constraints available to downstream design activities for the generation of design alternatives and subsequently, the derivation of the final product, a means, based on Extensible Markup Language technology, was provided for ergonomic constraints propagation.

40|$|Pressure ulcers are {{prevalent}} and costly, {{particularly for}} individuals with impaired mobility and sensation. They are primarily caused by high pressure near bony prominences. Multiple other factors include shear force, friction, temperature, and moisture. Recent research at the University of Pittsburgh was conducted on local cooling effects with respect to skin blood flow. A reduction of skin temperature to 25 °C provided a significant benefit to local tissue in healthy controls and subjects with spinal cord injuries. This concurs with prior animal studies which demonstrated reductions in breakdown at lower interface temperatures. Pressure ulcers have been historically managed by providing support surfaces, such as <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions,</b> to redistribute pressure at the body interface. Few practical interventions exist to control temperature at this interface; most employ passive cooling methods, which are limited by their inability to modulate applied cooling in response to changes in microenvironment. This study's goal was to develop tightly controlled, local cooling elements for integration into a pressure-redistributing support surface. A holistic view of temperature control methods in an iterative design process was taken. Features, benchmarks, and design specifications were generated using available information from the literature. Idea generation and subsequent evaluation led to the modification of a multi-cell air cushion capable of controlling temperature in specific high risk areas. Proof of concept experiments were conducted with respect to interface cooling to a target temperature, redistribution of pressure, and heat and water vapor transmission. The design delivered local cooling over hour-long trials on able-bodied test subjects. No significant difference in skin temperature (p> 0. 16) was found after 15 minutes of cooling from our target temperature (25 °C). The modified cushion showed similar (p= 0. 79) peak pressure index values {{when compared to the}} same cushion design without the cooling elements. A thermodynamic rigid cushion loading indenter mimicked the environmental conditions of the body on our prototype for 3 -hour duration tests. Significantly lower temperatures were observed after 1 hour of cooling (p< 0. 003). No effect was noted for relative humidity. These experiments successfully demonstrated plausible, integrated cooling elements in a multi-cell air cushion for the delivery of local cooling for pressure ulcer prevention...|$|R
40|$|Decubitus ulcers are {{a severe}} and {{potentially}} life-threatening complication {{for individuals with}} a spinal cord injury. Prevention is the most cost effective approach {{to the problem of}} pressure ulcers. The wheelchair cushion, often viewed as t e primary mechanism for prevention, is not the only means. Conscious pressure relief is a necessity for prevention of pressure sores. In this study, the Xsensor Pressure Mapping System was used to investigate the effectiveness of four different <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> coupled with three different pressure relieving techniques. The purpose of this. study was to determine which combination best alleviates and distributes the pressure at the body-seat interface of individuals with quadriplegia. Results for pressure distribution in static sitting showed: ROHO high profile had a significant (p 3 ̆c. 001) increase in mean number of cells at low pressure when compared to Flofit, Jay 2, and personal cushion. When comparing pressure relief techniques, sidebending right and left had a significant (p=. 023) increase in mean number of cells at nil pressure when compared to forward flexion. Results for pressure distribution while looking at four different cushions coupled with three different pressure relief techniques showed Flofit had an increase in mean number of cells at nil pressure when compared to ROHO High Profile and Jay 2. With these results one may. conclude that 1) the ROHO High Profile appears to be the more adequate cushion for pressure distribution in static sitting, 2) the Flofit cushion appears to be the more adequate cushion for pressure distribution when-performing the three different pressure relief techniques and 3) the sidebending techniques give significantly more pressure relief than the forward flexion pressure relief technique. It is essential that when prescribing <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> clinicians are cognizant of the fact that all clients have individual needs. Furthermore, the Xsensor Pressure Mapping System is only one component of the clinical decision making process...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence of wound problems in an aging and longer-lived population {{continue to increase}} substantially. Pressure ulcers (bedsores) are painful, increase risk for secondary infection, and add 11 billion annually to health care costs in the US. When a sufficient fraction of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s weight is supported in a region with a bony prominence, the resulting localized concentration of external pressure reduces the cross-sectional area of blood vessels, restricting blood flow and limiting oxygen supply to the at-risk tissue. If this external contact pressure is maintained for sufficient time, the lack of oxygen leads to tissue death and formation of a pressure ulcer. Very few effective ulcer prevention devices exist and those available have focused almost exclusively on some form of off-loading (specialized and costly beds and <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions)</b> designed to equalize pressure distribution on at-risk tissue areas. Furthermore, <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> have no applicability to other body areas (legs, heels, etc.) at risk for pressure injury. Despite extensive {{work in this area}} of pressure ulcer prevention, a survey of available options shows that there is no compact, low-cost solution that is workable in a hospital setting, for patients confined to bed at home, or for those with limited mobility in wheelchairs. In this work we present a wireless sensor patch to be placed on known at-risk sites on the patient 2 ̆ 7 s skin, directly measuring local contact pressure and temperature, and communicating with a base station (in a hospital setting) or smartphone (for home care). Alerting a patient or caregiver to a potentially harmful level of pressure allows early intervention (only when necessary) to prevent pressure ulcer formation, easing workload on caregivers and enabling more independence for mobile at-risk patients...|$|E
40|$|The chairbound, {{disabled}} person requires a supportive cushion to distribute pressure {{in order to}} reduce the risk of pressure sores and any alteration to the load carrying capacity of the cushion may have a deleterious effect on its ability to provide adequate. support. The National Health Service supplies two basic grades of polyurethane foam for <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> and this study investigated the effect of water content on their compressive load carrying capacity. Both foams became less stiff and exhibited greater than 20 % increase in deformation when containing 20 % water by volume at loads encountered in seating. This decrease in stiffness may result in a dramatic change in the pressure distribution under a patient particularly if only a small section of the cushion becomes wet. This result emphasizes the need to fit waterproof coverings to these foam cushions and to maintain the integrity of the covering...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe International Organization of Standardization (ISO) has {{developed}} test protocols that quantify {{the physical and}} mechanical characteristics of <b>wheelchair</b> seat <b>cushions</b> that are considered relevant to their influence on tissue integrity (ISO 16840 - 2). The draft standard contains a total of nine test methods, of which we have focused on four tests, namely recovery, load-deflection and hysteresis, lateral and forward stiffness, loaded contour depth and overload deflection. The first goal {{of this study was}} development of the recovery test protocol. Recovery characterizes the short-term (25 sec) and long-term (20 min) resilient tendencies of a cushion. The test was repeated three times on three sets of eight cushions. The same sets of cushions were tested by two other laboratories to verify protocol reproducibility. The test had high intra-lab repeatability, but low inter-lab reproducibility. The reproducibility is affected mainly due to the high sensitivity of the test. The results also suggested that the long-term recovery test be converted to a pass or fail binary test. The goal of {{the second part of the}} study was to implement these tests and to evaluate their reliability by analyzing their repeatability and ability to differentiate between the cushions. Each test was run on a set of 21 commercially available cushions. Reliability and repeatability was evaluated using the ICC (intra class correlation coefficient) and RC (repeatability coefficient). The load-deflection and hysteresis characterizes the cushions' hysteresis at 8 N, 250 N and 500 N. The 250 N value was the most reliable measure. The lateral and forward stiffness test measures the peak and 60 sec force required to displace the cushion indenter by 10 mm. The test showed high reliability. The loaded contour depth (LCD) and overload deflection test measures the cushions' depth of immersion in loaded (135 N) and overloaded (180 N) states. The LCD test was also highly reliable. However, lack of variability for the overload test suggests that it be converted into a binary test, to check if the cushion has bottomed out or not. The recovery test displayed high intra-lab repeatability, but its reliability is questionable due to its poor ability to distinguish between cushions. Overall, the test results suggest that time interval between replications should be increased to atleast 30 mins to reduce the potential of a systematic trend between readings. The RC can be used as a precision statement for each test, thus giving us a baseline for acceptable variations between its replications. In order to validate these tests completely, we need to establish inter-lab reproducibility, conduct research to investigate the clinical resolution for each test and clinically validate these test parameters...|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} number of elderly {{long-term}} care residents in the United States, pressure ulcers (PU) represent a significant healthcare problem. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) reported in 2001 that the incidence rates of PU in long-term care residents ranged from 2. 2 % to 23. 9 % and the prevalence from 2. 3 % to 28 %. Multiple risk factors for the development of PU have been suggested, and can be divided into extrinsic factors and intrinsic factors. The aims of this study were to: (1) conduct a focused literature review of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to PU development in elderly long-term care residents; (2) conduct a secondary analysis of demographic and clinical data from Randomized Clinical Trial on Preventing Pressure Ulcers with Seat Cushions (RCT-SC), to identify risk factors associated with acquiring/not acquiring a PU in elderly long-term care residents. Three different methods were used to analyze the data: (a) stepwise logistic regression, (b) odds ratios, and (c) Exhaustive Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID); and generate a decision-making tree for the prescription of <b>wheelchairs</b> and seat <b>cushions</b> by rehabilitation practitioners for elderly long-term care wheelchair users. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of the rehabilitation team decisions were also established. As a result of this study it was concluded that:(a) the focused literature review provided useful information about intrinsic, extrinsic and combinations of these risk factors in PU acquisition,(b) the stepwise logistic regression, odds ratios, and CHAID analyses confirmed known risk factors and added new risk factors that predict PU development,(c) the decision-making tree can be a starting point for rehabilitation practitioners that are new to the field of seating and mobility, and (d) the decision making tree showed that the use of a pressure mapping system is a good tool if used in combination with clinical judgment...|$|R
40|$|For many {{wheelchair}} users, pressure sores are {{an unavoidable}} chronic physical disorder. As well as healing wounds, preventing {{the disease is}} a vital issue, and the wheelchair cushion {{is one of the}} most important aids for taking care of the sore. However, the <b>wheelchair</b> <b>cushions</b> and other cushions to support physically disabled people of today ’ s market still have many problems. Due to hygiene issues and prevention of the sore, it is important to change the where one sits down, as well as to change and wash the cushion frequently. Wheelchair users must continue to sit on the cushion for a long time even if it the cushion has many problems, since ordinary sofas and chairs do not give enough support. I defined that the wheelchair, sofa and car/airplane seats are the most important places for wheelchair users to enjoy a more active life and thus created new types of cushions to alleviate the problems encountered in these areas...|$|E
