30|$|<b>Waxes</b> and {{asphaltenes}} are {{the most}} important constituents of crude oils because they have a great influence on crude oil properties. <b>Waxes</b> are a complex mixture of solid (at ambient temperature) hydrocarbons which consist mainly of paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a small amount of}} naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as polar compounds. There are two general classes of petroleum <b>waxes.</b> <b>Waxes</b> that are composed primarily of normal alkanes (n-alkanes) with a chain length of C 18 –C 30 and crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) with a melting point of 40 – 60  °C are referred to as paraffin <b>waxes</b> (Jowett 1984). <b>Waxes,</b> which consist primarily of the higher molecular weight n-alkanes within C 30 –C 60, with a high share of iso-paraffins and naphthenes, and have much higher melting point ranges (above 60 – 90  °C), are referred to as microcrystalline <b>waxes.</b> According to Musser and Kilpatrick (1998), paraffinic and microcrystalline <b>waxes</b> have molecular weight ranges of 350 – 600 and 300 – 2500, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing <b>wax</b> on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing <b>wax</b> customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of <b>wax</b> made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does <b>wax</b> that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing <b>wax</b> on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a <b>wax</b> sealant.
