As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and moisture in air forming a <b>white</b> <b>coating</b> of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E

For this purpose, cross sectional survey of the bacterial contamination of <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> in a medical college has been carried out in 3 different locations; Royal College of Medicine, Perak, University of Kuala Lumpur and a private college attached to Ipoh General Hospital. It was found that the incidence of Staphylococus aureus, was 32 % on short-sleeved and 54 % on long-sleeved <b>white</b> <b>coats.</b> Bacillus species was the second most common type of bacteria found. Male collars and female pockets had higher microbial contaminations (p= 0. 01, 0. 03 respectively).

Materials and Methods: The swabs for the study were taken from the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> of undergraduate students posted in various clinical departments, interns, and the post-graduate students.
