25|$|A cowboy is {{an animal}} herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, {{traditionally}} on horseback, and often performs {{a multitude of}} other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to <b>work</b> <b>cattle.</b> In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but {{in the modern world}} have established the ability to work at virtually identical tasks and obtained considerable respect for their achievements. There are also cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, who perform work similar to the cowboy in their respective nations.|$|E

500|$|Vaqueros {{were the}} {{horsemen}} and cattle herders of Spanish Mexico, who {{first came to}} California with the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino in 1687, with two expeditions in 1769, and the Juan de Anza expedition in 1774. They were the first cowboys in the region. She learned horse training methods that derived from this tradition. In her teens, she was mentored in horsemanship by Morgan horse breeder and cattle rancher Mary [...] "Sid" [...] Spencer. The Spencer property, called Forsyth Ranch, was near Arroyo Grande on land that is now under Lopez Lake. Spencer helped Varian learn the underlying principles of training and riding horses, how to <b>work</b> <b>cattle</b> in the mountains, and introduced her to vaquero training methods. Spencer also did all of her own ranch work including shoeing, gelding, horse training, baling hay, and truck repairs. She learned how to handle well-trained horses by riding one of the Spencer family's finished Morgans, a gelding named Little Horse. With Spencer's help, she also learned to recognize correct conformation and balance in horses.|$|E

500|$|There {{are four}} main bloodlines {{groups within the}} Morgan breed today, known as the Brunk, Government, Lippitt, and Western Working [...] "families." [...] There are also smaller subfamilies. The Brunk Family, {{particularly}} noted for soundness and athleticism, traces to the Illinois breeding program of Joseph Brunk. The Lippitt Family or [...] "Lippitts" [...] trace to the breeding program of Robert Lippitt Knight, grandson of industrialist Robert Knight and maternal great-great grandson of Revolutionary War officer Christopher Lippitt, founder of the Lippitt Mill. Robert Lippitt Knight focused on preservation breeding of horses descended from Ethan Allen II and this line is considered the [...] "purest" [...] of the four lines, with the most lines tracing back to Figure and no outcrosses to other breeds in the 20th or 21st centuries. [...] The Government Family is the largest, tracing to Morgans bred by the US Morgan Horse Farm between 1905 and 1951. The foundation sire of this line was General Gates. When USDA involvement ended, the University of Vermont purchased not only the farm, but much of its breeding stock and carries on the program today. [...] The Working Western Family, abbreviated 2WF, have no common breeder or ancestor, but are the horses bred to be stock horses and <b>work</b> <b>cattle,</b> some descended from Government farm stallions shipped west.|$|E

30|$|Most of {{the cattle}} were tended well during winter and early spring when farmers were freed of farming work and fodder was scarce in the forests. Animals were fed with dried grasses, straw, kitchen wastes, and stock-piled {{vegetables}} - mostly pumpkin, radish, and turnip. Some were tethered in crop fields to feed on paddy stumps and dried grasses during winter season, immediately after the harvest. Contrastingly, in summer and early autumn when fodder was plentiful in the forests and when farmers were heavily engaged in agricultural <b>works,</b> <b>cattle</b> were mostly left freely grazing in the forests on their own. It was during such seasons cattle were highly vulnerable to wild predators.|$|R
