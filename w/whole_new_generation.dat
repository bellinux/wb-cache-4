500|$|Wagner {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the principles and practice of conducting. His essay [...] "About Conducting" [...] (1869) advanced Hector Berlioz's technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was {{a means by which}} a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Felix Mendelssohn; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores. Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> of conductors (including Furtwängler himself).|$|E

His first compositions date from c. 1900 and were pastiches in the style of Mozart (quartets, 1905 album verses for piano). His first quartet was performed in Leipzig in 1908, and his sixth (Opus 12, 1905) in the year 1909. In 1909, his Chamber Symphony in F major (written 1906) won the Frankfurt/Main Mozart prize. From this time onwards, Toch dedicated himself to being a full-time composer. He won the Mendelssohn prize for composition in 1910. In 1913, he was appointed lecturer of both piano and composition at the College of Music in Mannheim. After winning a further five major prizes for his works, he served four years in the army on the Italian Front during World War I. In 1916, he married Lilly Zwack, the daughter of a banker.|$|R

Saadiq's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album, Stone Rollin', in 2011, as he noted the louder, raw sound and general feeling of performing live. It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{explores the}} ways in which teachers’ biographies shape the act of teaching. It {{illuminates}} the formative (emotional, private, personal and professional) influences and experiences in teachers’ lives and work. After offering a detailed examination of the most significant ‘players’ (teachers’ educational beliefs, emotional connection and/or emotional knowledge of the subject matter; context and history syllabi) co-performing with the history teacher, the study then specifically focuses on the intersections between teachers’ emotional and personal history; their emotional knowledge and orientation to the subject matter; their pedagogical choices and the contexts (the type of school and in particular the subject’s locations in that school) within which they teach. The research is inter-disciplinary and is premised upon theoretical and empirical studies in: teaching history, historical empathy, teaching the Holocaust, biography, modalities of teachers’ knowledge, emotion in education, teachers’ educational beliefs and context. It is a qualitative multiple-case study of 20 teachers working in 15 disparate schools and subject locations. The qualitative empirical materials gathered for the study have allowed single and cross-case comparisons to be made within the study through examining both the individual and collective meanings that teachers bring to their work. Once this information is interpreted, a clearer picture emerges of what it is that history teachers regard as being most influential in affecting their choice of content or even their orientation to their subject matter. By discovering the emotional, private and personal dimensions of teachers’ knowledge (an area which has to date been virtually unrecognised and/or acknowledged), this study has not only added to existing knowledge, but it has invited inquiry into a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> area—second <b>generation</b> emotional knowledge (SGEK).

40|$|Introduction: The {{identification}} and characterization of two M. tuberculosis-specific antigens (ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10) {{has led to}} the development of a <b>whole</b> blood <b>new</b> <b>generation</b> of M. tuberculosis specific diagnostic tests, that have several advantages over tuberculin skin test (TST), in terms of higher specificity, better correlation with surrogate measures of exposure to M. tuberculosis in low-incidence setting, and less cross-reactivity with M. bovis (BCG) vaccine and environmental mycobacteria. The role of these new tests in evaluating post-therapy tuberculosis eradication has not been investigated yet. Aim of this longitudinal study was to determinate changes of response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens in patients during the standard tuberculosis treatment and to investigate the in vitro effects of tuberculosis drugs on the IFN-γ release. Methods: 23 individuals with active tuberculosis were enrolled and followed over time. They were tested with QuantiFERON TB-Gold (QFT-Gold) at four time points: at diagnosis (t 0), after 3 and 6 months of treatment (t 1 - t 2) and at the end of the specific treatment (t 3). Results: At baseline all patients were positive by QFT-Gold. At second time-point 17 out of 23 (74 %) were positive, at third time-point 11 of 23 (47 %) were positive, at treatment completion 3 / 23 (13 %) were positive. The conversion to negative response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens was found in 87 % patients analyzed after successful therapy. Longitudinal QFT-Gold testing shown a significant decrease (p< 0. 001) of IFN-γ response during the therapy. No inhibitory effect on IFN-γ release was noted in vitro for chemotherapy using at concentrations compatible with those achieved in serum of treated patients. We have revealed an inhibitory effect only at concentrations 2 - 3 times greater than those previously tested. Conclusion: A successful therapy for tuberculosis causes a significant decrease of the ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 response and this data suggest that the QTF-Gold assay may have a role as a tool for evaluating tuberculosis eradication after standard tuberculosis treatment...|$|R
