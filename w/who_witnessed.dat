5|$|Marshal Murat {{convened a}} {{military}} tribunal, chaired by General Emmanuel Grouchy, that morning to summarily try and sentence anyone found {{in possession of}} a potential weapon. Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> the aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Doaiz's death his wife entered a convent in Seville.|$|E

Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Æthelwold's {{immediate}} family. Æthelred was born in about 848 and died in 871, so his sons must have been young children when he died. Æthelred's wife was probably the Wulfthryth <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> a charter in 868. Æthelwold {{and his older brother}} Æthelhelm are first recorded in King Alfred's will in the 880s. Æthelhelm is not heard of again, and he probably died soon afterwards. The only other record of Æthelwold before Alfred's death is as a witness to a charter that probably dates to the 890s.|$|E

5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa {{is known}} to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith's date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf's father's name was Cuthberht, who may have been the same person as an ealdorman of that name <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{charters}} during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa's reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen, who had {{the highest}} lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but {{by the middle of}} the tenth they had {{authority}} over a much wider area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal with the problems of governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called Æthelstan, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.|$|E

While the ballet is being performed, the Phantom, not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The Phantom, <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 1857, a joint {{force of}} Mohave and Quechan warriors {{launched}} a major attack {{with hundreds of}} warriors on a Maricopa village close to Maricopa Wells, Arizona, on the Gila river. The Battle of Pima Butte was described {{by a group of}} white mail carriers <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|E
5|$|The {{petitions}} {{and political}} crisis continued to {{the reign of}} Hamad (1923–42) who —encouraged by the British— began it by setting up a criminal court to try {{those involved in the}} violence including his first cousins, the Khalids. The ruler was put in a dilemma between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. The Khalids, however, held a deep grudge against residents of Sitra <b>who</b> <b>witnessed</b> against them, and in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. The attackers were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy second trial, but managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. Their father was confined to Manama. The trials marked the first time in Bahrain's history that members of the ruling family were convicted.|$|E
5|$|The three FRAP {{members were}} buried the same morning in Hoyo de Manzanares.
