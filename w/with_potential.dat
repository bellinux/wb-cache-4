5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated <b>with</b> <b>potential</b> complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage {{and people who}} had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH {{were more likely to}} bleed from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On the basis of the ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Footdrumming is used widely as a {{predator}} warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns {{in a number}} of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat. Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact <b>with</b> <b>potential</b> rivals.|$|E

Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} potentials, mutations and Jacobian algebras {{in the framework}} of tensor algebras associated with symmetrizable dualizing pairs of bimodules on a symmetric algebra over any commutative ground ring. The graded context is also considered by starting from graded bimodules, and the classical non simply-laced context of modulated quivers <b>with</b> <b>potentials</b> is a particular case. The study of potentials in this framework is related to symmetrically separable algebras, and we have two kinds of potentials: the symmetric and the non symmetric ones. When the Casimir ideal of the symmetric algebra coincides with its center, all potentials appear as symmetric potentials and their manipulation mimics the simply laced study of quivers <b>with</b> <b>potentials.</b> This useful information suggests that, for applications to cluster algebras theory and related fields, one may restrict a further study of modulated quivers <b>with</b> <b>potentials</b> to the setting where the ground symmetric algebra is separable over a field.
