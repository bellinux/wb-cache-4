5|$|Grissom and Sidle's {{relationship}} {{has been the subject}} of intense debate in the press and on-line forums, between fans of the romantic relationship and those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> romance detracts from what was once a show devoted mainly to mysteries and a forensics laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Midway through season three, Kate persuades Rousseau to {{help some}} of the {{survivors}} find the Others' home, by informing her that Alex helped her escape from the Others. When they arrive, Rousseau abandons the group and watches from the bushes as Alex walks past. A few days later, Rousseau leads the survivors to the radio tower {{in order for them}} to contact a nearby freighter. En route, they encounter Ben and Alex; Ben explains to Alex who Rousseau is and the mother and daughter are reunited. Season four begins with the survivors dividing into two groups, with those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> people from the freighter to be dangerous, including Rousseau and Alex, joining Locke (Terry O'Quinn). After learning of the freighter crew's intentions to kill everyone on the island, Ben directs Rousseau, along with Alex and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), to head to the Temple where the rest of the Others are located. On their way, Rousseau and Karl are shot by unseen attackers, and both are killed. The buried bodies of both are discovered by Miles (Ken Leung), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Claire after they leave Locke and travel back to the beach.|$|E

5|$|Nick flees at high speed, {{setting off}} a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him {{to get rid of}} the witness.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

25|$|Another {{difference}} is between those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> New Covenant has already substantially arrived (Preterists), {{and that this}} knowledge of God that the member of the New Covenant has is primarily salvific knowledge; and those that believe that the New Covenant has not yet substantially arrived, but will in the Second Coming, and that this knowledge is more complete knowledge, meaning {{a member of the}} New Covenant no longer has to be taught anything at all regarding the Christian life (not just that they lack need for exhortation regarding salvific reconciliation with God).|$|E

25|$|By 2004, it was {{observed}} that since the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad movie choices, agreeing with peers <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus on}} the origins and evolution of life continues to be challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually young Earth creationism, creation science, old Earth creationism or intelligent design) as an alternative. Most of these groups are literalist Christians <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> biblical account is inerrant, {{and more than one}} sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize. Some groups see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views that cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by many mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought (non-overlapping magisteria), which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it.|$|E
25|$|Equiano recounted an {{incident}} when an attempted kidnapping of children was foiled by adults in his Igbo village, Essaka, {{in the southeastern}} part of present-day Nigeria. When he was around the age of eleven, he and his sister were left alone to look after their family premises – as was common when adults {{went out of the}} house to work. They were both kidnapped and taken far away from their hometown of Essaka, separated and sold to slave traders. After changing ownership several times, Equiano met his sister again, but they were again separated, and he was taken across a large river to the coast, where he was held by European slave traders. He was transported with 244 other enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados in the West Indies. He and a few other slaves were sent further away to the British colony of Virginia. Literary scholar Vincent Carretta argued in his 2005 biography of Equiano that the activist could have been born in colonial South Carolina rather than Africa based on his discovery of a 1759 parish baptismal record that lists Equiano's place of birth as Carolina and a 1773 ship's muster that indicates South Carolina. A number of scholars agree with Carretta, while his conclusion is disputed by other scholars <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> weight of evidence supports Equiano's account of coming from Africa.|$|E
