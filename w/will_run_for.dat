500|$|The game's NPCs feature {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) systems that detect unscripted visual and aural cues. If an NPC sees or hears {{something out of}} place, it will react to this, depending {{on the level of}} its suspicions; if for a brief second, they will simply ignore it, but if for long enough, they will become alert to their surroundings and begin searching the area. NPCs will react to things such as clashing swords or the reaction in other NPCs' voices, as well as to visual changes to their environment, such as blood stains, opened doors and fallen bodies; players can avoid leaving visual clues by cleaning them up, such as hiding bodies. NPCs are divided between three categories - [...] "guards", [...] "servants", and [...] "non-human" [...] - whose reactions vary; guards will call out an alert if they spot the player and attack them; servants <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> help if they spot the player or a body; non-human NPCs will merely pursue and attack the player. [...] If a guard is significantly injured, he will try to escape and find help; some non-human NPCs will merely flee. Non-human characters range from giant spiders, feral creatures, to zombies and ghosts, with certain levels containing survival horror elements.|$|E
