Therefore, the culture of Minangkabau is often considered as a contradictory or antithesis of the Javanese culture, frequently represented as the overall culture of Indonesia. The peculiarity of Minangkabau culture lays in its matrilineality which influences lineage and inheritance. The contradictory matter refers to the society of Minangkabau that is the largest Islamic followers in Indonesia, yet their ancestral traditions are not completely in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>teachings,</b> some even are contradictory. It is a common knowledge that a literary work is not born from an ‘empty culture 2 ̆ 7 meaning that a literary work must be influenced by its author.

One area worth examining is the transaction involving house buying, particularly the one that falls under the purview of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 (Act 118) and transactions involving houses pending completion. This paper examines this area of transaction and the loan agreement, affected via Bay’ Bithaman al-Ajil (BBA), provided by Islamic banking and financial institutions in Malaysia.

Transformation from purely traditional Javanese bridal costumes to those with some application of Islamic clothing style is gaining rapid acceptance and begins to {{be considered as a}} popular fashion style by a great number of Indonesians, especially in urban areas like Surabaya. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover cultural (Java) and religious (Islam) symbolisms implied in the modification and to examine the signification involved in the process. By applying the fashion system theory, this paper seeks to unravel the symbolisms in modern Javanese-Moslem bridal costumes which reveal a thought system built of two intertwining aspects: Javanese culture and Islamic religious principles. Deep observation into the cultural and religious symbolisms reveals that the modern Javanese-Moslem bridal costumes are actually invented by bridal stylists as a form of capitalism which benefits from a consumerist lifestyle. This fact reflects a shift in the way people signify modern Javanese-Moslem bridal costumes from Javanese local culture to contemporary Javanese culture. Another interesting finding shows that people choose this Javanese-Moslem style for their bridal costumes because of not only religious considerations but also its popularity. <b>The</b> application of <b>Islamic</b> fashion style in the Javanese-Moslem bridal costumes is no longer associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> obedience to <b>Islamic</b> <b>teachings</b> but is a mere reflection of a growing trend towards more extensive body coverage.
