5|$|Within a dreamscape, hunter Bobby Singer (Beaver) {{searches}} {{around an}} old house and is suddenly attacked by a woman (Elizabeth Marleau). A maid tries to no avail to wake him up in his motel room. Meanwhile, Dean Winchester (Ackles) finds his brother Sam (Padalecki) drinking at a bar {{in the middle of}} the afternoon. When Dean questions him about it, a drunken Sam admits that he is upset about not being able to save Dean from his demonic pact, which left him only a year to live. <b>What</b> <b>bothers</b> Sam even more is that Dean, who has little self-worth, is not even concerned about his fate. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Oliver {{learns that}} {{a woman in the}} {{apartment}} building had recently died by falling from her window. A week passes before she tells Poirot, who feels this is <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> Norma. The woman was Louise Charpentier. Norma says that her father ran off with Louise Birell. Later, Mrs Oliver finds a piece of paper linking Louise Charpentier to Andrew. Mary Restarick has been ill from poison in her food. Sir Roderick engages Poirot to find documents missing from his files which encounter brings young Sonia under suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|According to the commentaries {{published}} in [...] "El Regañón de La Habana", {{it can be}} concluded that those [...] "guarachas" [...] were very popular within the Havana population at that time, because in the same previously mentioned article the author says: [...] "…but most importantly, <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me most is the liberty with which a number of chants are sung throughout the streets and town homes, where innocence is insulted and morals offended… by many individuals, not just of the lowest class, but also by some people that are supposed to be called well educated..." [...] Therefore, {{it can be said that}} those [...] "guarachas" [...] of a very audacious content, were apparently already sung within a wide social sector of the Havana population.|$|E

6000|$|His eyes fell now. He {{flushed and}} shifted uneasily in his chair. [...] "I don't know." [...] Then he unbent {{a little in}} saying, [...] "That's <b>what's</b> <b>bothering</b> me right now." ...|$|R
60|$|This time I {{was close}} to {{laughing}} outright. But he was far too serious to remark my mirth. He commenced once more, with an ahem, which gave me a better inkling than frankness of <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> him.|$|R
2500|$|Use against Clinton of the [...] "bitch" [...] epithet flourished {{during the}} campaign, {{especially}} on the Internet but via conventional media as well. [...] Hundreds of YouTube videos carried the word, with such titles as [...] "Hillary Clinton: The Bitch is Back" [...] and [...] "Hillary Clinton: Crazy Bitch", and a Facebook groups with the theme proliferated, including one named [...] "Life's a Bitch, Why Vote for One?" [...] that had more than 1,500 members. [...] Broadcaster Glenn Beck used the term in describing her. In a November 2007 public appearance, John McCain was asked {{by one of his}} supporters, [...] "How do we beat the bitch?" [...] (McCain responded by saying, [...] "May I give the translation?" [...] and then went on to say he respected Clinton but could defeat her.) [...] A February 2008 Saturday Night Live monologue by Tina Fey led a backlash-through-embracing movement, when she said [...] "I think <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me the most is when people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let me say something about that. Yeah, she is. And so am I.... You know what? Bitches get stuff done.... Get on board. Bitch is the new black!" [...] A new Facebook group [...] "Bitch is the new Black" [...] gained three times the membership of all the anti-Clinton groups named after the word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every word," [...] Penelope answered. [...] "You see, I {{am trying}} {{to give you a}} start in your career. <b>What</b> <b>bothers</b> me is an entirely {{different}} question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more do I, Trot," [...] said he. [...] "But that's nat'ral, seein' as we're {{under water}} so far. <b>What</b> <b>bothers</b> me most {{is how we}} manage to breathe, havin' no gills like fishes have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She wasn't no child, Mr. Brooks. We were deceived. My {{brother was}} a fool, and men don't {{understand}} these things. She was a grown woman--accordin' to these folks' ways and ages--when she kem here. And that's <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> me." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} after the Kelly disappointment, one last LP appeared, Is That <b>Whats</b> <b>Bothering</b> You Bunkie (Epic LN 24159). Taking its title from [...] "The Old Philosopher"s catchphrase, Bunkie {{contained}} five new [...] "Old Philosopher" [...] monologues and six other routines.|$|R
5|$|On 17 August 636, Vahan pondered {{over his}} {{failures}} and {{mistakes of the}} previous day, where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks, but after initial success, his men were pushed back. <b>What</b> <b>bothered</b> him the most was the loss {{of one of his}} commanders.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{have plenty}} of time after leaving here to-night; but <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me is that I may have a row with Sam Barney, 'cause I ain't goin' to let him swell 'round borrowin' money on my account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not afraid}} but that I'll {{be able to}} go through with our part of the show all right, but the trouble is that I'll show up for no more than a boy, and that's <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me." ...|$|E
60|$|LEVER. [Evasively.] Oh! There's my brother's and my sister's too. I 'm {{not going}} to let any of you run any risk. When we all went in for it the thing looked splendid; it 's only the last month that we 've had doubts. <b>What</b> <b>bothers</b> me now is your Uncle. I don't want him to take these shares. It looks as if I'd come here on purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} discomforts – {{the sleeping}} in attics, the {{total lack of}} sanitation, the scanty and poor food – Gertrude could and did take as fortunes of war. <b>What</b> <b>bothered</b> her more was the breakdown in communications with me. Always dependent upon getting frequent letters from those she loved, she chafed and worried because no mail reached her.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>bothered</b> Frederick in Polly {{was that}} she {{attracted}} him as well as repelled him. His own daughter had never interested him in that way. Mary moved along frictionless grooves, and to forecast her actions was so effortless that it was automatic. But Polly! many-hued, protean-natured, he never {{knew what she was}} going to do next.|$|R
60|$|That was {{a clever}} idea, but <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> the old Sorcerer {{was to find}} a secret place. He wandered all over the Saucer at the top of Mount Munch, but found no place in which to write the secret word where others might not be likely to stumble upon it. So finally he decided it must be written somewhere in his own house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now here's <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me. She knows music. I {{asked her}} if she played. And he's fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn't he a piano for her? Another thing: she's quick and lively and he watches her {{whenever}} she talks. He's on pins and needles, and continually breaking in and leading the conversation. Say, did you ever hear that Swithin Hall was married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Fear!’ {{said the}} little man: ‘isn’t it a lovely {{thing to see}} him and his wife a going up in one balloon, and his own son and his wife a jostling up against them in another, and all of them going twenty or thirty mile in three hours or so, and then coming back in pochayses? I don’t know where this here science is to stop, mind you; that’s <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so----But here's <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me: I like fabrics; dinky {{things like}} that; little {{drawings}} and elegant words. But look over there at those fields. Big! New! Don't it seem {{kind of a}} shame to leave this {{and go back to}} the East and Europe, and do what all those people have been doing so long? Being careful about words, when there's millions of bushels off wheat here! Reading this fellow Pater, when I've helped Dad to clear fields!" ...|$|E
50|$|Moreover, Russell's {{ability to}} sing in Spanish {{would prove to be}} a {{double-edged}} sword: it gave him popularity and acceptance at the onset, but it also typecast him as a Latin singer, leaving him out of work when the popular wave of Latin music passed. But, <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> Russell the most was that his identity as an American singer could be called into question.|$|R
60|$|In {{the height}} of the gusts, in the three days and nights of the gale, we logged as much as eight, and even nine, knots. <b>What</b> <b>bothered</b> me was the {{acquiescence}} of the mutineers in my programme. They were sensible enough in the simple matter of geography to know what I was doing. They had control of the sails, and yet they permitted me to run for the South American coast.|$|R
2500|$|Palestinian {{representative}} to the United Nations Ibrahim Khraishi called the report unbiased and professionally compiled. He further added, [...] "This report was important; <b>what</b> <b>bothered</b> some parties was that the report simply monitored international law, international humanitarian law and all relevant international instruments. This was not a political instrument that supported Palestine or Israel." [...] He added the report {{was the first time}} killings of Palestinian civilians have been documented, and that his people would not forgive if those responsible were not punished.|$|R
6000|$|... “Solidarity {{with the}} extremest form {{of action is}} one thing, and silly {{recklessness}} is another,” he said, {{with a sort of}} moody brutality. “I don’t know what came to Verloc. There’s some mystery there. However, he’s gone. You may take it as you like, but under the circumstances the only policy for the militant revolutionary group is to disclaim all connection with this damned freak of yours. How to make the disclaimer convincing enough is <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{means that}} I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I can see, {{it is just}} as tangled a {{business}} as ever I handled, and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn't go wrong. There's no motive, Mr. Holmes. That's <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me--I can't put my hand on a motive. Here's a man dead--there's no denying that--but, so far as I can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{long way}} to go without {{anything}} to eat," [...] she said, [...] "and we can give you some breakfast. But I want to ask you something. I am in a good deal of perplexity. Our two servants are out at the front of the house, but they positively refuse to come in; they are afraid that your house may begin sliding again and crush them all, so, I shall have to get breakfast. But <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me is trying to find our well. I have been outside, and can see no signs of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abram cannot sleep, tossing {{and turning}} {{from side to}} side... Finally his wife Sarah inquires: [...] "Abram, <b>what's</b> <b>bothering</b> you?" [...] / [...] "I owe Moishe 20 roubles, but I have no money. What shall I do?" [...] / Sarah bangs on the flimsy wall and shouts to the neighbors: [...] "Moishe! My Abram still owes you 20 roubles? Well he isn't giving them back!" [...] / Turning to her husband, she says reassuringly: [...] "Now go to sleep and let Moishe stay awake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My public-house? Not {{a bit of}} it, nor ever likely. I’m stuck here, I fancy. I don’t like {{to leave}} the kids, you see: and—there’s no use talking—they’re better here than what {{they would be in}} a white man’s country, though Ben took the eldest up to Auckland, where he’s being schooled with the best. But <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> me is the girls. They’re only half-castes, of course; I know that as well as you do, and there’s nobody thinks less of half-castes than I do; but they’re mine, and about all I’ve got. I can’t {{reconcile}} my mind to their taking up with Kanakas, and I’d like to know where I’m to find the whites? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had some}} {{talk with a}} youngish man whose {{business}} it was to train avalanches to jump clear of his section of the track. Thor went to Jotunheim only once or twice, {{and he had his}} useful hammer Miolnr with him. This Thor lived in Jotunheim among the green-ice-crowned peaks of the Selkirks--where if you disturb the giants at certain seasons of the year, by making noises, they will sit upon you and all your fine emotions. So Thor watches them glaring under the May sun, or dull and doubly dangerous beneath the spring rains. He wards off their strokes with enormous brattices of wood, wing-walls of logs bolted together, and such other contraptions as experience teaches. He bears the giants no malice; they do their work, he his. <b>What</b> <b>bothers</b> him a little is that the wind of their blows sometimes rips pines out of the opposite hill-sides--explodes, as it were, a whole valley. He thinks, however, he can fix things so as to split large avalanches into little ones.|$|E
5000|$|The {{affected}} persons {{fall asleep}} during day-to-day activities and always feel sleepy. One {{of the doctors}} said, [...] "You wake them up, they can speak to you, reply to you, {{but as soon as}} you stop talking and ask <b>what</b> <b>bothers</b> them, they just want to sleep, sleep, sleep.".|$|E
50|$|Culture shock {{has many}} {{different}} effects, time spans, and degrees of severity. Many people are handicapped by its presence {{and do not}} recognize <b>what</b> is <b>bothering</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{awfully good}} and kind," [...] she said, {{and then began}} hesitantly on <b>what</b> was <b>bothering</b> her. [...] "You... you can't stay now, with him... away, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|Rebecca Dee has spiked green hair, {{a lot of}} body piercings {{and even}} more attitude. But that's not <b>what's</b> <b>bothering</b> Jake, Cally and the others. They're more worried about the 'accidents' that seem to happen {{whenever}} their new team mate is around. And about where she keeps sneaking off to late at night. Because with strange and dangerous events unfolding in the world outside Spy High, her unusual behaviour is looking like more than just coincidence. In fact, Bond Team are beginning to suspect that Rebecca Dee is a double-agent....|$|R
