40|$|A {{rule for}} {{choosing}} among nested models is presented, {{taking into account}} that the usual model selection procedure is a sequence of tests, followed by estimation of the parameters that remain in the model. <b>We</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> theoretical approach and formulate the loss functions and the rules from a Bayesian point of view. The rule resembles a Neyman-Pearson type test but it takes into consideration the estimation loss across different candidate models and reports an estimate together with an associated loss, taking into account the uncertainty in the selection. The method is compared with other existing procedures and illustrated by examples. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} {{an improvement in}} the state-of-theart large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) performance, under clean and noisy conditions, {{by the use of}} visual information, in addition to the traditional audio one. <b>We</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> fusion approach for the audio-visual information, where the single-modality (audio- and visual- only) HMM classifiers are combined to recognize audio-visual speech. More specifically, we tackle the problem of estimating the appropriate combination weights for each of the modalities. Two different techniques are described: The first uses an automatically extracted estimate of the audio stream reliability in order to modify the weights for each modality (both clean and noisy audio results are reported), while the second is a discriminative model combination approach where weights on pre-defined model classes are optimized to minimize WER (clean audio only results) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>We</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> {{theoretical}} approach to fisheries management, using a Bayesian approach {{to integrate the}} uncertainty about stock dynamics and current stock status, and express management objectives {{in the form of}} a utility function. The value of new information, potentially resulting in new control measures, is high if the information is expected to help in differentiating between the expected consequences of alternative management actions. Conversely, the value of new information is low if there is already great certainty about the state and dynamics of the stock and/or if there is only a small difference between the utility attached to different potential outcomes of the alternative management action. The approach can, therefore, help when deciding on the allocation of resources between obtaining new information and improving management actions. In our example, we evaluate the value of obtaining hypothetically perfect knowledge of the type of stock–recruitment function of the North Sea herring (Clupea harengus) population...|$|R
40|$|Prediction suffix trees (PST) {{provide a}} popular and {{effective}} tool for {{tasks such as}} compression, classification, and language modeling. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> theoretic view of PSTs for the task of sequence prediction. Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a loss bound for it. The depth of the PST generated by this algorithm scales linearly with {{the length of the}} input. We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm which automatically grows a bounded-depth PST. We also prove an analogous mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm. The result is an efficient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any fixed PST determined in hindsight. ...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Traditional {{scheduling}} models {{which only}} address {{the sequence of}} jobs to be processed at the production stage under some criteria are no longer suitable and should be extended {{to cope with the}} distribution stage after production. In a rapidly changing environment, competition among enterprises has a tendency to turn towards competing between supply chain systems instead of competing between individual companies. Emphasizing on the coordination and the integration among various members of a supply chain {{has become one of the}} vital strategies for the modern manufacturers to gain competitive advantages. Approach: This research focuses mainly on a class of two-stage scheduling problem, in which jobs need to be delivered to customers by vehicles after the completion of their respective production. It is assumed that the transportation time of a vehicle is constant and jobs to be delivered occupy different physical spaces. Results: The result of this research is to show the scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total completion time is intractable and to develop a heuristic by incorporating properties inherited in an the optimal schedule. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Decision</b> Support System (DSS) view to construct a Scheduling Support System (SSS) for solving the scheduling problem with delivery coordination. Conclusion/Recommendations: The scheduling support system with an additional problem management subsystem can provide more useful information for users when the management makes <b>a</b> strategic <b>decision</b> than traditional scheduling methods can. It can give firms a competitive advantage on the global competitive market...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{application}} of Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) for 3 rd- Generation (3 G) wireless systems. We propose a new method for selecting the appropriate Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) according to the estimated channel condition. in this method, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> statistical <b>decision</b> making approach to maximize the average throughput while maintaining an accept- able Frame Error Rate (FER). We use a first-order finite-state Markov model to represent the average channel Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in subsequent frames. The MCS is selected in each state of this Markov model (among the choices proposed in the 3 G standards) to maximize the statistical average of the throughput in that state. Using this decision-making approach, we also propose a simplified Markov model with fewer parameters, which is suitable in systems where changes in the fading characteristics need to be accounted for in an adaptive fashion. Numerical results are presented showing that both of our models substantially outperform the conventional techniques that use <b>a</b> threshold-based <b>decision</b> making...|$|R

On that basis <b>we</b> will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and {{there is a need for}} the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama’s Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People’s Republic of China.|$|R

Our objective is to minimize the amplitude of the electrical current flowing through the diodes which has a direct impact on the lifetime of such a display. The optimization problem consist of finding a decomposition of an image into subframes with special structural properties that allow the display driver to lower the stress on the diodes. For monochrome images, we present an algorithm that finds an optimal solution of this problem in quadratic time. Since {{we have to find a}} good solution in realtime, we {{consider an}} online version of the problem in which <b>we</b> have to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> for one row based on a constant number of rows in the lookahead.

In e-commerce, online shopping and online tourism, its very crucial to analyse the good amount of social data present on the Web automatically therefore, its very important to create methods that automatically classify them. Opinion Mining sometimes called as Sentiment Classification is defined as mining and analysing of reviews, views, emotions and opinions automatically from text, big data and speech by means of various methods.
