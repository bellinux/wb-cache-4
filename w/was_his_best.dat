5|$|After {{some initial}} issues with San Antonio over his contract, Ginóbili re-signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004–05 season. This <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> season yet {{as he was}} {{selected}} as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All-Star team, marking his debut in the elite mid-season showcase. During the playoffs, Ginóbili's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio's third championship. The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4–1 in the Conference Finals, before prevailing in a very defensive oriented seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons. Ginóbili recorded career-highs in his playoff numbers, most notably 20.8 ppg and 5.8 rpg, and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs. In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting, the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan. The former finished the 2004–05 season as the second leading scorer on the team. During the season, he became only the fourth person to win consecutive Olimpias de Oro, this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tévez.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet's {{final season}} for Oxford <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> statistically. He scored his maiden {{first-class}} century against London County and, against Sussex, he recorded what {{were to be}} the best bowling figures of his career, taking nine for 31 in the second innings and a total of 15 wickets in the game for 65 runs. His final match for Oxford was the 1900 University match, in which he scored 42 and 23. For the remainder of the season, Bosanquet re-joined Middlesex, and in his second match, against Leicestershire, achieved the rare distinction of a century in each innings: 136 in 110 minutes in the first innings, followed by 139 in 170 minutes in the second. He scored three further fifties for Middlesex and once took five wickets in an innings, but bowled comparatively rarely, only once bowling more than 13 overs in an innings. In all first-class matches in the season, Bosanquet scored 1,026 runs at 34.20 and took 50 wickets at 23.20.|$|E

After {{representing}} Canada at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, {{he was named}} to the Western Conference team for the WHL All-Star Game in Regina, Saskatchewan, which he missed, as well as much of the season, due to injury. However, Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games, a near one point-per-game average, and {{was named to the}} WHL West Second All-Star Team. Brewer was the highest ranked defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. He was drafted fifth overall by the New York Islanders in June 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1954–55 England toured Australia {{for five}} Ashes Tests. Davidson started his season well, scoring 30 and 27 not out {{and taking a}} total of 5/104 as New South Wales drew with England. His victims {{included}} leading batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Bill Edrich. However, Davidson succumbed to injury and missed Australia's only win of the series in the First Test, and upon his return in the Second Test, managed match figures of 2/86 and did not pass twenty in either innings as England levelled the series. He was dropped for the Third Test, but continued to perform strongly in domestic matches, including a sequence of 19 wickets in three matches. This included 4/45 including the wickets of Compton, Bailey and Graveney in a tour match against England, and a match-winning performance against arch-rivals Victoria that sealed a second successive Shield triumph with a resounding nine-wicket win in two days. He tore through the Victorians with 5/36 and 4/50, removing Harvey and Test all rounder Sam Loxton twice. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> match bowling figures in his career to date.|$|E
5|$|In the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, Davidson took 4/44 {{and then}} 5/38 {{in the second}} innings as he and Benaud took all ten wickets and South Africa were skittled for 144. Australia won by eight wickets and took the series 3–0. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> Test match haul to date. He scored 127runs at 21.17 and took 25 wickets at 17.0 in the Tests. He had success against Russell Endean and John Waite, dismissing both twice. Although {{he was unable to}} score heavily in the Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine first class centuries during the tour. In all, he had taken 72 wickets at 15.13 and scored 813runs at 54.20 for the entire tour. From this tour onwards, in 32 Tests, he was to take 170 wickets at 19.26 and score 1011runs at 27.32 in the {{remainder}} of his career.|$|E

He finished in front of Daniel Bailey from Antigua and Barbuda (10.12 seconds) in a heat won by eventual gold medallist Usain Bolt of Jamaica (9.87 seconds). Overall he finished 15th out of 75th athletes overall and was unable to progress further because his time was 0.09 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round. After the event Phiri said he placed a large amount of pressure onto himself but was not good enough in the event. Nevertheless, he thanked the people who supported him.|$|E
5|$|Malik {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Punjab B during the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, against Bahawalpur in 1956–57. He finished the season taking 13 wickets {{at an average}} of 8.30.

Malik played three matches during 1957–58 and his best bowling figures came against Punjab, taking 5 for 66. In the next two domestic seasons, he was more effective with the ball, taking 23 and 28 wickets respectively. Malik played a match against the Indian Starlets at Sargodha in April 1960. He took 12 wickets for 135 runs in the match.

He also found the net on Boxing Day in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. The week after Milne played what he felt <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> game in a Manchester United jersey in a 3–1 New Year's victory over rivals Liverpool. However {{they were unable to}} maintain their form and finished 11th in the league after winning only three of their last 14 league games.

Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.|$|E
5|$|The two teams' {{defenses}} {{also performed}} statistically well during the game. Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd led all defenders by recording 11 tackles during the game. Included in that total were four tackles for loss, including one sack. That performance <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> {{in terms of}} quantity during the season, and his four tackles for loss moved him into sixth place on Cincinnati's list of career tackles for loss leaders. For the Hokies, Dorian Porch had eight tackles, leading all Tech players. Cody Grimm, Orion Martin, Stephan Virgil, and Kam Chancellor each recorded one interception. The four interceptions were a Tech bowl-game record, and Chancellor's catch gave him six for the season, tying him with Victor Harris for the most on the team. It {{was the first time}} since 1968 that two Virginia Tech players had six interceptions apiece. Cincinnati's sole interception came at the hands of Brandon Underwood, who tallied his third of the season.|$|E
5|$|Brown made 17 in {{his only}} innings as Australia won by eight wickets. Between Tests, Brown scored 113 {{in a slow}} innings against Yorkshire to retain his middle-order {{position}} for the Second Test at Lord's. He was unable to replicate the Test centuries he made in the preceding tours, scoring 24 and 32. It was to be his last Test, as Sam Loxton top-scored with 159 not out against Gloucestershire in the match before the Third Test, ousting Brown from his middle-order position. Barnes was injured in the Third Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test; instead, Lindsay Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order and struck 112. Brown then scored 140 against Derbyshire immediately after the Fourth Test, in a dour display that displeased spectators, and then scored consecutive centuries against Kent and the Gentlemen of England after the Tests. He ended with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 runs on the tour at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris, with the 200 against Cambridge University his highest score. Brown took 4/16 against the South of England in his only bowling assignment of the tour. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> career bowling figures, having amassed only six wickets in his first-class career. In three visits to England, Brown scored 18 centuries.|$|E
