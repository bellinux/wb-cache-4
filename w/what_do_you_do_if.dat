An obvious {{approach is to}} perform a repair: modify the object minimally to get something that satisfies the constraints. This approach has been in-vestigated in the database community, for integrity constraints, and in the AI community for propositional logics. Here we study {{how difficult it is}} to repair a document in the form of a string. Specifically, we consider number of edits that must be applied to an input string in order to satisfy a given target lan-guage. This number may be unbounded; our main contribution is to isolate the complexity of the bounded repair problem based on a characterization of the regular languages that admit bounded repairr. We consider the settings where the repair strategy is unconstrained and when the editing must be produced in a streaming way, i. e. by a letter-to-letter transducer...|$|E

40|$|Consider a small {{political}} {{field experiment}} {{in which you}} will assign a campaign message in four precincts, two predominantly Democratic and two predominantly Republican. To prevent your preconceptions from influencing the experiment, you decide to randomize the two available campaign messages (say, A and B) to the precincts. You know that precinct partisanship is likely to strongly a↵ect voters ’ responses to the campaign messages. You randomly select two precincts to assign message A to, and both Democratic precincts are chosen. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>If</b> you proceed, you {{will be unable to}} untangle the e↵ects of partisanship from that of the campaign messages.

40|$|In this report, {{we talked}} about a new {{quantitative}} strategy for choosing the optimal(s) stock(s) to trade. The basic notions are generally very known by the financial community.

A number of alternative access systems exist, for example: alternative keyboards, tracker balls, touchscreens, head pointers etc. But for some people these devices are also an impossibility, {{and this is where}} switches 'kick in'. The main subject of this document is the switch user. For completeness we have include a brief mention of other input devices, which may be grouped together as 'alternative access systems'. We aim to: - Encourage developers to include switch access into their products - Standardise practice and terminology. This document explains some of the issues involved for people with severe physical difficulties who access computers and other electronic devices with switches. It details the ways in which switch users interact with computer programs and other technology designed to be directly accessible to them. The document includes some precise definitions of terms. It also attempts to survey the whole range of issues associated with switch use. As such it should be useful to professionals working or entering the field, those software developers considering switch users {{for the first time and}} also for those already developing in this area...|$|E
