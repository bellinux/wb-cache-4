5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|About 222million women <b>who</b> <b>want</b> {{to avoid}} {{pregnancy}} {{in developing countries}} are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased {{the number of deaths}} during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
