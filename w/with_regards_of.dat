40|$|Background: Patient {{satisfaction}} {{was one thing}} that was very important in reviewing the quality of health services, including in health center. Measuring patient satisfaction can be used to evaluate the quality of health services. In this study the dimensions related to health service user satisfaction, were in terms of reliability, assurance, tangible, emphaty, and responsiveness. The purpose of this research was to know the level in district of outpatient services and inpatient care at district health center Sidoarjo. Methods: The study design was observational descriptive. The study was all patients who visited health center through out the November to December of 2006. The sample size was taken in a systematic random sampling with sample of 1250 people. Results : The study found that in health center without bed <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>of</b> working hours, mobile clinic services, and the completeness of service type were 19. 1 %, 19. 6 % and 16. 9 % respectively. In health center without bed <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>of</b> reability aspects, the indicator with the value of lessgood were opening hours (19. 1 %), the completeness of service types (16. 9 %). Meanwhile, in health center with bed were mobile clinic services (34. 2 %). Seen from assurance aspects, the indicator with the value of lessgood were the freedom to choose health officers (32. 0 %) in health center without bed, 38. 4 % in health center with bed. The study concluded that the patients did not feel satisfactory with health center services, especially <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>of</b> opening hours, freedom to choose health offices demanded by the patients.   Key words: patients expectations, patients satisfaction, PHC</p...|$|R
