5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on <b>wood</b> <b>chips,</b> rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down dead or dying organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and in <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E
30|$|Woody biomass {{business}} is commonly characterized {{as lack of}} markets and infrastructure, uncompetitive pricing, unprofitable industries, and public unconcern {{in the viewpoint of}} economic aspects (Becker et al. [25], Sundstrom et al. [26]). However, utilization of <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> which is based on waste wood resources in local area is significantly in connection with regional economic impact. 19, 300 ton of sales volume of <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> can produce 447.7 million JPY. Moreover, <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> utilization was estimated to generate 263.3 million JPY of positive balance, as <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> sales for paper increases exports and converting Bunker A to <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel decreases imports in Maniwa. As <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> utilization promoted, it could provide a strong contributions to the regional economy and employment from forestry and related industries.|$|R
30|$|We {{obtained}} {{quantitative information}} related to <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> production, the cost of raw material, and the price paid for <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> through interview with executives of lumber cooperation and person in charge at the Maniwa city hall in May, 2012. We also refer to reports analyzed by NEDO [16] and Japan federation of wood-industry associations [17] {{in order to get}} detailed information about <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> facilities.|$|R
30|$|As <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> {{utilization}} is promoted, it {{will affect}} the import and export conditions in Maniwa. For <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for paper which is consumed outside Maniwa, the amount of export {{and the amount of}} import are increase to 283.5 million JPY and 43.9 million JPY, respectively. And for <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for board manufacture, there is an increase in the amount of import of 0.62 million JPY without exporting.|$|R
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which will take advantage of fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection for dead wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E

30|$|These {{calculations}} {{produced the}} results that for 1, 500 ton of <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel can be substituted around 345  kl of Bunker A, and it is worth about 25.3 million JPY. When Bunker A is used as fuel, 100  % of Bunker A is dependent on imports, while the amount of import for <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel is increased to 0.95 million JPY without exporting. Therefore, we can expect 24.3 million JPY of substitution effect, by replacing Bunker A with <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel.|$|R

5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallus species, P.indusiatus is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in disturbed ground and among <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> In Asia, it grows among bamboo forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains. The {{method of reproduction}} for stinkhorns, including P.indusiatus, is different from most agaric mushrooms, which forcibly eject their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion. The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects. Species recorded visiting the fungus include stingless bees of the genus Trigona, and flies of the families Drosophilidae and Muscidae. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to germinate elsewhere. Although {{the function of the}} indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.|$|E

5|$|Recorded dietary {{items include}} sago shoots and insects, {{and it also}} {{swallows}} small stones to help break up its food. It is apparently monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour. The only known nest was a shallow bowl {{in the top of}} a rotting tree stump that was lined with <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and dry leaves. The two young chicks were entirely covered in black down typical of precocial newly hatched rails. The estimated population of 3,500–15,000 birds and the restricted range mean that the invisible rail is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss has occurred through the harvesting of sago and conversion of the wetlands to rice cultivation, and the rail is eaten by local people. The described nest was in an area frequented by local villagers, so the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{can be useful}} for drying wood for {{construction}} and wood fuels such as <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money {{it takes to make}} a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful in the process of drying products such as <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E
