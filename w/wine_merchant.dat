5|$|The Medieval Merchant's House {{was built}} in about 1290 on FrenchStreet, Southampton, then a major port and a large provincial town with a {{population}} of around 5,000, grown rich from the trade with England's continental possessions in Europe. The area of Southampton around FrenchStreet had been re-planned earlier in the century, reducing the numbers of farm animals kept in and around the houses, driving poorer merchants and craftsmen into the less desirable northern half of the city, and creating a quarter of large, impressive houses, often built in stone with tiled roofs. The original house was designed for use by John Fortin, a prosperous <b>wine</b> <b>merchant,</b> with a vaulted cellar for holding stock, a shop {{at the front of the}} property and accommodation for the family; much of it {{was built in}} stone, but it featured a timber front, a fashionable design for the period. At least 60 other houses similar to the Medieval Merchant's House were built in Southampton at around the same time.|$|E
5|$|The arch gateway at {{the western}} end of the churchyard bears a skull and {{crossbones}} at the top of each pillar.

Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born <b>wine</b> <b>merchant</b> Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married local women, are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.|$|E
