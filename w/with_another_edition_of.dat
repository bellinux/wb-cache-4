60|$|About {{thirty years}} ago no fewer than three copies were sold at Brighton, of all places. M. Quentin Bauchart had a copy only 127 millimetres in height, which he swopped to M. Paillet. M. Chartener, of Metz, had a copy now bound by Bauzonnet which was sold for four francs in 1780. We call this the age of cheap books, but before the Revolution books were cheaper. It is fair to say, however, that this example of the 'Pastissier' was then bound up <b>with</b> <b>another</b> book, Vlacq's <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> 'Le Cuisinier Francois,' and so went cheaper than it would {{otherwise}} have done. M. de Fontaine de Resbecq declares that {{a friend of his}} bought six original pieces of Moliere's bound up with an old French translation of Garth's 'Dispensary.' The one faint hope left to the poor book collector is that he may find a valuable tract lurking in the leaves of some bound collection of trash. I have an original copy of Moliere's 'Les Fascheux' bound up with a treatise on precious stones, but the bookseller from whom I bought it knew it was there! That made all the difference.|$|R

6000|$|It may {{be worth}} noting that Chapman's first {{instalment}} of his translation of the Iliad, containing Books I, II, and VII-XI, appeared in 1598, and thence the author could adapt the passages from Iliad, Book VII. In or about 1598-9 occurred, in Histriomastix, by Marston and others, a burlesque speech in which Troilus, addressing Cressida, speaks of [...] "thy knight," [...] who [...] "SHAKES his furious SPEARE," [...] while in April 1599, Henslowe's account-book contains entries of money paid to Dekker and Chettle for a play on Troilus and Cressida, for the Earl of Nottingham's Company. {297a} Of this play no more is known, nor can we be sure that Chapman's seven Books of the Iliad (I, II, VII-XI) of 1598 {{attracted the attention of}} playwrights, from Shakespeare to Chettle and Dekker, to Trojan affairs. The coincidences at least are curious. If [...] "SHAKES his furious SPEARE" [...] in Histriomastix refers to Shakespeare in connection with Cressida, while, in 1599, Dekker and Chettle were doing a Troilus and Cressida for a company not Shakespeare's, then there were TWO Troilus and Cressida in the field. A licence to print a Troilus and Cressida was obtained in 1602-3, but the quarto of our play, the Shakespearean play, is of 1609, [...] "as it is acted by my Lord Chamberlain's men," [...] that is, by Shakespeare's Company. Now Dekker and Chettle wrote, apparently, for Lord Nottingham's Company. One quarto of 1609 declares, in a Preface, that the play has [...] "never been staled <b>with</b> the stage"; <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> <b>of</b> the same year, from the same publishers, has not the Preface, but declares that the piece [...] "was acted by the King's Majesty's servants AT THE GLOBE." [...] {298a} The author of the Preface (Ben Jonson, Mr. Greenwood thinks, {298b}) speaks only of a single author, who has written other admirable comedies. [...] "When he is gone, and his comedies out of sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new English Inquisition." [...] Why? The whole affair is a puzzle. But if the author of the Preface is right about the single author of Troilus and Cressida, and if Shakespeare is alluded to in connection with Cressida, in Histriomastix (1599), then it appears to me that Shakespeare, in 1598-9, after Chapman's portion of the Iliad appeared, was author of one Troilus and Cressida, extant in 1602-3 (when its publication was barred till the publisher [...] "got authority"), while Chettle and Dekker, in April 1599, were busy <b>with</b> <b>another</b> Troilus and Cressida, as why should they not be? In an age so lax about copyright, if their play was of their own original making, are we to suppose that there was copyright in the names of the leading persons of the piece, Troilus and Cressida? ...|$|R
