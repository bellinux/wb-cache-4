One puncture wound <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the braincase and may have been the fatal blow. There was also a bite mark on the frontal trigon.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of his body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E
5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> side of the engine, the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold {{on the left side of}} the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E

5|$|Three {{infantry}} {{divisions of}} the XXI Corps began moving their units into position on the coastal plain on 7 December. The 75th Division <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> with the 54th (East Anglian) Division in the centre and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the coast. Infantry from the 162nd (East Midland) Brigade, relieved the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in the front line on 11 December and the mounted riflemen, who had been heavily involved in the earlier attempt to capture the Nahr el Auja, moved back to bivouac near Ayun Kara.|$|E
5|$|Wellington quickly {{changed his}} plans after seeing his flank attack fail. He {{converted}} his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held back only 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Caçadores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn {{and replaced by}} the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Boès broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed {{to the left and}} John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Taupin's tired soldiers, who had been fighting for about four hours, were driven back behind the Plassotte knoll where they rallied.|$|E
5|$|For {{the spring}} 1797 campaign, Bonaparte {{organized}} his army into eight divisions {{of which the}} 3rd Division under Sérurier counted 6,543 soldiers. In the Battle of Valvasone on 16 March, Bonaparte drove back the rear guard of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. During the operation Sérurier's division was in reserve, but in the subsequent advance it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> flank while Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division was {{in the center and}} Guieu's division was on the left flank. On 19 March Bernadotte attacked Gradisca d'Isonzo and was repulsed. After Sérurier's division swung around the south side of Gradisca and gained the heights {{in the rear of the}} town, the garrison surrendered. The French captured four battalions of Austrian infantry totaling 2,500 soldiers, 10 guns and eight colors. While Bernadotte continued advancing to the east, Guieu's division followed by Sérurier turned north in pursuit of a column under Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza. At this time Sérurier fell ill and command of his division passed to Louis François Jean Chabot. Trapped between Massena and Guieu, Bajalics was forced to surrender with 4,000 men in the Battle of Tarvis. After recovering, Sérurier resumed command of his division at Graz on 20 April and after the Treaty of Leoben the unit withdrew from Austria and took position at Sacile.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921–22, Hammond, needing work, signed to play {{professional}} football for Bristol Rovers F.C. in Division Three South, following his success at school and in the Bristol Downs Football League. After {{some time in the}} reserves, he made four appearances for the first team that season. He played in ten games the following season, and four times in 1923–24. His usual position <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> wing. Despite scoring twice in his career, he never showed much enthusiasm for the game and was cautious around tackles, mindful that his main career was cricket. He was criticised in the local press for his role in two defeats shortly before his final appearance. After he was left out of the team, he never played again and left the club, deciding that he could not play two sports professionally. Even so, the Rovers' trainer, Bert Williams, and manager, Andy Wilson, believed that Hammond, one of the fastest players they had seen at the club, would have had the potential to play international football.|$|E
25|$|Squire married Susan Fey, a Labour Party activist, in 1981. Questioned {{about the}} marriage, Fey stated that she <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{wing of the}} Labour Party and her husband was on {{the left of the}} Conservative Party. As such, she {{considered}} that there was no great political difference between them. The couple had two children (one son and one daughter) by Fey's previous marriage and divorced in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Economically, Sayeed <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the Conservative party, {{opposing}} British {{entry into}} the single European currency. He had strong views on defence. On social matters, {{he was on the}} more liberal wing of the party, with the exception of gay rights in the Armed Forces where he opposed the lifting of the ban on homosexuals. As an MP he was considered a well informed and thoughtful contributor to debates on foreign policy in the Middle East and on economic, defence and social matters.|$|E

25|$|Later in March the 48th Army was {{reassigned to}} Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky's Central Front. At {{the outset of}} the Battle of Kursk the 137th was a {{separate}} division, although still alongside the 143rd. 48th Army <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> flank of its front, on the north shoulder of the Kursk salient. The main blow of the German 9th Army attack fell on the 13th Army to the west. When the German assault ran down by July 12, 48th Army was in good shape {{to take part in the}} counteroffensive towards Oryol, which continued into August.|$|E
25|$|Three {{infantry}} {{divisions of}} the British XXI Corps, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin, began moving their units into position on the coastal plain on 7 December.

25|$|Battle {{losses are}} unknown and, {{although}} an Austrian victory, {{the battle of}} Hollabrunn did allow Masséna to write to Napoleon and report that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> track following the Austrians, whose main body was retreating along the river Thaya near Laa an der Thaya. Johann von Klenau would later be awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa for his actions {{at the battle of}} Wagram and gallant rearguard actions after that battle. Meanwhile, Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen regrouped a large force at Jetzelsdorf, on the Pulkau river, but he later evacuated this position, after receiving intelligence that a French force was approaching Znaim from the east. The next major combat would be the one at Znaim, where the Austrians demanded an armistice.|$|E

25|$|General Roy's Military Survey map of Scotland (1745–55) {{marks the}} Lambroughton brae road as {{being part of}} the 'Post' road from Irvine to Glasgow, {{therefore}} giving it some importance as the mails were carried along it. This same road running up from Cunninghamhead was made into a turnpike by the 'Ayr Roads Act of 1767' and the opportunity was taken to move the route away from Townhead of Lambroughton through which it used to run. The date of construction is unclear as the 1775 map doesn't show a new route.

25|$|French {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} René Descartes {{was the first}} to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his Le Monde (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|Two Japanese battalions {{from the}} 144th Infantry Regiment forming Horii's South Seas Detachment had pursued the Australians from Efogi, while the main Japanese force had {{remained}} behind waiting {{for permission to}} continue the advance. The Japanese pursuit group subsequently launched their attack on Ioribaiwa Ridge just as the two Australian battalions began to deploy into their attacking positions {{on either side of}} the defensive line: the 2/33rd was positioned to the left of the 2/14th and 2/16th on a knoll on the western side of the east–west ridge line, and the 2/33rd <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of line, to the east of the 3rd Infantry Battalion. The start of the Japanese attack halted the forward movement of the 2/31st and 2/33rd Infantry Battalions as they came into line with the defensively postured units, which inadvertently extended the Australian line {{on either side of the}} ridge.|$|E

25|$|Fairfax {{had drawn}} up his army {{on the ridge}} a mile north of Naseby, {{although}} {{some of it was}} behind the crest on the reverse slope. Ireton's wing of five and a half regiments of cavalry was on the left. The infantry under Sergeant-Major General Sir Philip Skippon was in the centre with five regiments in the front line and three in support. A forlorn hope of 300 musketeers was deployed to the front, and two companies of Colonel Edward Harley's regiment were in reserve. A Parliamentarian engraving of the battle shows 11 pieces of artillery, in the intervals between the infantry regiments. They played little part in the battle; their first salvoes went high, and the Royalist and Parliamentarian infantry were subsequently too closely engaged for the guns to be used. Cromwell's wing, with six and a half regiments of cavalry, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Maida on 4 July 1806, Reynier {{had three}} brigades on the field, led by Generals of Brigade Compère, Luigi Gaspare Peyri, and Antoine Digonet. Compère led two battalions {{each of the}} 1st Light (1,810) and 42nd Line Infantry Regiments (1,046). Peyri's brigade {{included}} two battalions of the 1st Polish Legion (937) and the 1st Battalion of the 4th Swiss Regiment (630). Digonet commanded two battalions of the 23rd Light Infantry Regiment (1,266), four squadrons of the 9th Chasseurs à Cheval (328), and several 6-pound foot and 3-pound horse artillery pieces (112). On the French side, the 1st Light and 42nd Line were on the left with the 42nd echeloned {{to the right and}} rear of the 1st, Peyri in the center, and Digonet on the right. On the British side, Kempt <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> Acland in the center, Cole on the left with the artillery, and Oswald in the rear.

25|$|On 1 December 1948 at 6:30am, {{the police}} were {{contacted}} after {{the body of a}} man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. He was lying back with his head resting against the seawall, with his legs extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> collar of his coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven Kensitas cigarettes, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.|$|E
