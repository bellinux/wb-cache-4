25|$|Sci Fi's Quest for Atlantis: Startling New Secrets {{followed}} {{several different}} groups researching possible locations for the legendary Atlantis, {{one of which}} focused on the Bimini Road. Greg Little led {{a team of researchers}} on a dive to recover objects at Bimini Bay. Little and his team reported the discovery of an entire second layer of square-cut rocks with similar dimensions beneath the stones of the Bimini Road. However, they have yet to formally publish in any detail the evidence and observations that demonstrate the presence of this underlying layer and the square-cut nature of its blocks. As a result, its existence remains unproven. Little believes that his discovery suggests that the Bimini Road may actually be one part of an entire wall or <b>water</b> <b>dock.</b> He has also published an informal critique of Shinn's Skeptical Inquirer article. The Bimini Road was also discussed in season 4, episode 22 of the TV series In Search Of, as well as season 4, episode 22 of the History channel's TV series Ancient Aliens.|$|E

40|$|Small {{molecule}} docking {{predicts the}} interaction of a small molecule ligand with a protein at atomic-detail accuracy including position and conformation the ligand but also conformational changes of the protein upon ligand binding. While successful {{in the majority of}} cases, docking algorithms including RosettaLigand fail in some cases to predict the correct protein/ligand complex structure. In this study we show that simultaneous docking of explicit interface water molecules greatly improves Rosetta’s ability to distinguish correct from incorrect ligand poses. This result holds true for both protein-centric <b>water</b> <b>docking</b> wherein <b>waters</b> are located relative to the protein binding site and ligand-centric <b>water</b> <b>docking</b> wherein <b>waters</b> move with the ligand during docking. Protein-centric docking is used to model 99 HIV- 1 protease/protease inhibitor structures. We find protease inhibitor placement improving at a ratio of 9 : 1 when one critical interface water molecule is included in the docking simulation. Ligand-centric docking is applied to 341 structures from the CSAR benchmark of diverse protein/ligand complexes [1]. Across this diverse dataset we see up to 56 % recovery of failed <b>docking</b> studies, when <b>waters</b> are included in the docking simulation...|$|R

50|$|L. dispar is a wetland {{species in}} decline {{throughout}} Europe. The primary habitat of this butterfly has been drained for agricultural and other land usage, limiting their habitat. When it can, L. dispar will utilize plants growing away from watersides and among reed-fen vegetation.
