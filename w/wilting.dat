5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause <b>wilting</b> and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the <b>wilting</b> of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in glycerol or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, <b>wilting,</b> blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes <b>wilting</b> of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the <b>wilting</b> of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E

5000|$|When <b>Wilt</b> {{makes it}} to his creator's hometown, an {{imaginary}} friend with a basketball for a head, who is <b>Wilt's</b> enemy, beats him at a game of basketball {{for a second time}} as we learn that <b>Wilt's</b> creator was a basketball player that had become very skilled at the game after training with <b>Wilt.</b> It is revealed through memories and stories that one day a kid from down the block created a new friend, Foul Larry, who beat the two in a basketball game when, instead of blocking Larry, <b>Wilt</b> saved his creator from being crushed by him. This resulted in not only the loss of the game, but also caused his own arm to get crushed (later amputated) and his eye damaged permanently by the bouncing ball. Jordan Michaels, who is revealed to be <b>Wilt's</b> creator(and an obvious parody of Michael Jordan), was not angry at <b>Wilt,</b> especially after he was told that <b>Wilt</b> had saved his life. After being reunited with <b>Wilt,</b> Jordan offers to give <b>Wilt</b> fame and live with him in his mansion, but <b>Wilt</b> decides to keep on helping people and wishes to someday become adopted by another kid who would need an imaginary friend like him.

25|$|When the {{infection}} occurs {{in an early}} stage of the tomato plant there may be <b>wilting</b> on leaves because Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis enter the plant by wounds, including root wounds, and if the bacterium gets to the xylem then a systemic infection is likely that may plug the xylem vessels. The <b>wilting</b> may only show {{on one side of the}} leaf and may recover during cooler periods. The entire system of xylem within the plant allows the bacteria to form titers of up to 10^9 bacteria per gram of plant tissue. <b>Wilting</b> may eventually spread to all leaves and these leaves, along with their petioles, may also show distorted, curled growth. One way to diagnose a severe vascular infection is to pinch the stem. If the epidermis and outer layer of the cortex separate from the inner stem then you've got a severe vascular infection. These exposed parts will have a soapy feel. Canker lesions, though rare, may develop on the stem. These cankers are necrotic regions where the epidermis is gone. As the bacteria continues its colonization, the canker will deepen and expand. In terms of fruit development, tomatoes may fail to develop altogether or may look marbled because they are ripening unevenly.|$|E
25|$|The Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis {{wild type}} strain NCPPB382 carries two {{plasmids}} associated with virulence: pCM1 and pCM2.

The virulent and avirulent strains produced the same amount of ectopolysaccharides, suggesting that EPS does not {{play a significant role in}} pathogenicity.|$|E

40|$|Fusarium <b>wilt</b> is an {{important}} disease of pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. ] and it can cause severe yield losses. Chemical control of this disease is difficult and expensive; therefore, cultivation of resistant varieties/hybrids is the most efficient strategy for enhancing the production. In the present study, by using a <b>wilt</b> susceptible cytoplasmic-nuclear male-sterile line and four <b>wilt</b> resistant fertility restorers, one dominant and one recessive gene with dominant suppressive epistatic effects were found responsible for controlling resistance to Fusarium <b>wilt.</b> Considering the annual losses and wide spread nature of <b>wilt</b> diseases in pigeonpea, {{it is imperative that}} all the inbred and hybrid cultivars have high level of resistance to this disease. The presence of dominant gene for resistance will increase the efficiency of breeding <b>wilt</b> resistant cultivars because it will yield greater proportion of resistant genotypes in segregating generations. In hybrid breeding also, the presence of dominant gene for <b>wilt</b> resistance will be an advantage. The transfer of this gene in female hybrid parents will ease the breeding of <b>wilt</b> resistant hybrids because this will allow the use of both <b>wilt</b> resistant as well as susceptible restorers in generating <b>wilt</b> resistant hybrid combination...|$|R

25|$|When a soil {{becomes too}} dry, plant {{transpiration}} drops because {{the water is}} increasingly bound to the soil particles by suction. Below the <b>wilting</b> point plants are {{no longer able to}} extract water. At this point they wilt and cease transpiring altogether. Conditions where soil is too dry to maintain reliable plant growth is referred to as agricultural drought, and is a particular focus of irrigation management. Such conditions are common in arid and semi-arid environments.|$|E
25|$|In plants, {{nitric oxide}} can be {{produced}} by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also {{plays a role in}} plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before <b>wilting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due {{to weather}} conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. The peanut {{comes from a}} yellow flower which bends over and infiltrates the soil after {{blooming}} and <b>wilting,</b> and the peanut starts {{to grow in the}} soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.|$|E

25|$|Plants exhibiting aphid damage {{can have}} a variety of symptoms, such as {{decreased}} growth rates, mottled leaves, yellowing, stunted growth, curled leaves, browning, <b>wilting,</b> low yields and death. The removal of sap creates a lack of vigour in the plant, and aphid saliva is toxic to plants. Aphids frequently transmit disease-causing organisms like plant viruses to their hosts. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, is a vector for more than 110 plant viruses. Cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) often infect sugarcane, papaya and peanuts with viruses. Aphids contributed to the spread of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) among potatoes in the Irish potato famine of the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{females and}} nymphs suck sap with their {{piercing}} mouthparts. This leads to plant {{damage in the}} form of <b>wilting</b> and chlorosis of the foliage, leaf drop, stunted growth, and sometimes the death of the plant. Fruits such as oranges become lumpy and discolored when the insect feeds on them, and they may fall off the tree. Insects packed with harvested fruits continue to feed, causing more losses during shipping. The mealybug secretes honeydew, which coats leaves and fruits and causes the growth of sooty molds. A layer of mold can reduce the ability of a leaf to perform photosynthesis, and makes fruit unmarketable. The citrus mealybug is also a vector for plant viruses.|$|E
