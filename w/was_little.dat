5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted that there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades {{after the death of}} Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca {{may not have been the}} real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed in the early years of the Arab Empire.|$|E
5|$|By October 1941, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> money left, and {{the parish}} sold a house it possessed on Constitution Boulevard for $7,000, which {{was enough to}} pay off the $3,000 of debt. The other $4,000 covered some of the {{continuing}} costs of construction.|$|E
5|$|The RB-52C was the {{designation}} initially given to B-52Cs fitted for reconnaissance duties {{in a similar}} manner to RB-52Bs. As all 35 B-52Cs could be fitted with the reconnaissance pod, the RB-52C designation <b>was</b> <b>little</b> used and was quickly abandoned.|$|E

5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>little</b> {{support for}} {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it <b>was</b> <b>little</b> more than a skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine's thrust, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> improvement in overall performance, thus the project was shelved. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|After VE Day, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Potsdam Conference. Like Yalta, {{the conference}} focussed primarily on political issues, so there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> for Ismay to do. After Clement Attlee defeated Churchill in the 1945 election, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends {{for the remainder}} of their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.|$|E

Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E

5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> appetite {{within the country}} to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|E

5|$|As the German commanders on {{the spot}} had warned Hitler in vain, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> chance of the attack succeeding, and the {{concentration}} of their armoured reserves at {{the western end of}} the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, UBS became the first Wall Street firm to announce a heavy loss in the subprime mortgage sector as the subprime mortgage crisis began to develop. In May 2007, UBS announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM) division. Before that time, there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> understanding of the troubles at DRCM or the massive expansion of risk engineered by the investment banking division {{under the leadership of}} the newly placed CEO Huw Jenkins.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates <b>was</b> <b>little</b> more than a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
