5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E

In a wildlife {{survey conducted by the}} Government of Tamil Nadu in 2010, 46 tigers were sighted in the Sathyamangalam forest area.

On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate action to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the forest area and the tiger reserve declaration would strengthen wildlife conservation efforts, as the sanctuary managers will get more financial support from the central government and the Government of India may also provide support to appoint an additional anti-poaching watchers and fund the establishment of anti-poaching camps.|$|E

5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in overgrazing and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Sanctuary,</b> acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E
5|$|Gray wolves {{typically}} dominate other canid {{species in}} areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of gray wolves killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them. Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between gray wolves and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities. Gray wolves {{are the most important}} predator of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them {{in the spring and summer}} periods. Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them. In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Sanctuary.</b>|$|E
