5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he {{regarded as an}} omen, was when a kite dropped from the sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|E
25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area. For the 2008 version, the queue featured gravediggers and werewolves creeping up on the guests, though in 2009 this was reduced to one actor in a hooded robe. Guests waited at the door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E

50|$|After the egg is selected, the {{contestant}} chooses {{an envelope}} from a giant spinner. The {{contents of the}} envelope are revealed immediately, and the contestant is offered a choice: they can either take the revealed amount, or go for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> their egg. In {{the event that the}} contestant gets a bonus selection, and elects to go for the egg, the contents of the first egg are revealed first, and the same offer is made. If the contestant elects to go for the egg again, they automatically win <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> the second egg.|$|R
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside.</b> One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{she decided}} to go with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> the white wheel. [...] However, after being prodded by the hosts to take the money instead, Weng decided to forgo the {{possible}} jackpot prize revealed in the white wheel and instead take home the ₱100,000 for this round, plus the ₱37,000 from the earlier round. After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. [...] This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E

6000|$|Everything was a fresh joy to her, every {{print on}} the walls, every {{ornament}} on the brackets, seemed {{to speak to her}} eye and to her soul both at once, and the sense of comfort and beauty and home, after the bareness of school, seemed to charm her above all.

60|$|After some half-hour's delay, Mr Squeers reappeared, and {{the boys}} took their places and their books, of which latter {{commodity}} the average might be about one to eight learners. A few minutes having elapsed, during which Mr Squeers looked very profound, {{as if he had}} a perfect apprehension of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> all the books, and could say every word of their contents by heart if he only chose to take the trouble, that gentleman called up the first class.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} that, miss," [...] said the gardener; [...] "but {{sometimes}} I notice things I cannot see, as when I look upon a flower bud not yet open and know exactly <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> of it." ...|$|R

60|$|While {{they were}} talking Scraps had been roaming {{around the room and}} looking at all the pretty things it contained.

She found the bread and cheese, which she had no use for, and the bundle of charms, which were curious but quite a mystery to her. Then, turning these over, she came upon the six-leaved clover which the boy had plucked.|$|E
6000|$|Just above me, and {{a hundred}} yards in from the shore, a tree had fallen, its bushy top bending down two small spruces and making a low den, so dark that an owl could {{scarcely}} have seen <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside.</b> [...] "That's the spot," [...] I told myself instantly; but the mother passed well above it, without noting apparently how good a place it was.

At last he could stand it no longer. [...] "I'll just go down yonder," [...] says he, [...] "and peep through the key-hole; perhaps I can see what is there without opening the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Nettie slowly, “I don’t quite know. I {{have come}} across other men {{like him and}} found that they take one in. You fancy you can look right through them, and yet you see very little of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> them.” ...|$|R
