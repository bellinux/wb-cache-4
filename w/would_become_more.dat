5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the already {{existing}} dengue fever epidemic <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> widespread. Prior to Erica, there were already 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for leptospirosis was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, particularly to schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica. The name Erica was retired after the season.|$|E

50|$|In the Logic stage (grades 7 - 8), {{when a child}} <b>would</b> {{naturally}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> argumentative, Regents {{students learn}} Formal Logic.|$|R
5|$|NATO leaders {{endorsed}} {{measures to}} improve NATO’s {{ability to take}} on operations when and where necessary, committing themselves to be able at all times to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on operations {{in order to ensure}} that NATO has a permanently available pool of assets and forces that can deployed. They also endorsed changes to NATO’s defence planning, hoping that the Alliance’s long-term defence planning process <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> flexible, thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further, faster and still take on the full range of missions.|$|E
5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg {{were glad}} to hear that the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and was no longer a vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{research}} {{also indicates that}} once the Neolithic Britons' society settled, the ceremonial spaces <b>would</b> have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> restricted and the rituals controlled by the elites.|$|R

50|$|Democracy - Some {{people believe}} that {{eliminating}} the digital divide <b>would</b> help countries <b>become</b> healthier democracies. They argue that communities <b>would</b> <b>become</b> much <b>more</b> involved in events such as elections or decision making.|$|R
5|$|Québécois cartoonists would {{propose a}} number of strips {{to compete with the}} American strips that {{dominated}} the Sundays and dailies. The native Québec presence on those pages <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. Albert Chartier created the comical character Onésime in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Québec. After World War II, during the Great Darkness, comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new Franco-Belgian publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.|$|E
5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
25|$|While his {{own writing}} was {{sophisticated}} philosophy, {{and therefore not}} popularly accessible, he mentored others in the movement who <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> broadly known, like Zora Neale Hurston.|$|E
2500|$|The singer <b>would</b> later <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{reserved}} towards Black Market Music, {{describing it}} in 2016 as [...] "real somber", and expressing the regret {{of not having}} been involved enough during the production phase.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Montreux, Switzerland, in November 1973 with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. With the addition of David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, Purple's hard rock sound <b>became</b> <b>more</b> boogie oriented, incorporating elements of soul and funk which <b>would</b> <b>become</b> much <b>more</b> prominent on the follow-up album, Stormbringer.|$|R
50|$|In 1853 {{it created}} the Junior Order of United American Mechanics, as an youth auxiliary. This group <b>would</b> {{eventually}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> popular than the OUAM itself {{and became an}} independent adult organization in 1885.|$|R
25|$|In later centuries such revolts <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common; in the 12th and 13th centuries English kings were in {{constant}} trouble from revolts by the aristocracy, but rarely had trouble {{from the lower}} classes.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} deadly hail of missiles, enemies would {{frequently}} spread out, or seek cover, breaking up their formations {{and making them}} more vulnerable to the lancers' charges. Likewise, when they packed themselves together, into dense square or phalanx style formations, they <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to the arrows.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{the motor}} car was also {{inextricably}} linked to the economy, with 2,305,000 people working in the motor trade, or 10 percent of the labour force. It had already eclipsed the railway, and <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> prominent in the movement of goods and the workforce. The expansion of public transport would not provide an answer on its own.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s {{it was very}} common for Greek letter {{organizations}} to form in high schools. Many {{of the high school}} organization did not extend past their immediate schools. Delta Theta Tau <b>would</b> <b>become</b> much <b>more.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{also one}} of the {{earliest}} known screen instances of the usage of an Art Deco-style font in its titles which <b>would</b> later <b>become</b> <b>more</b> famously used as the basis for the Star Wars logo.|$|R
50|$|Iquan's Party {{would be}} {{inherited}} by Koxinga, and {{under his leadership}} {{the development of the}} trade arm of the organisation <b>would</b> <b>become</b> ever <b>more</b> intricate whilst the military arm was effectively unified. Koxinga founded the Kingdom of Tungning with these forces.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{presenting}} an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still {{sees the}} need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.|$|E
25|$|Kilgour and Matas {{concede that}} {{in at least}} some instances, the {{hospital}} staff may have been supplying answers that the callers wanted to hear {{in order to make a}} sale. The results of these phone calls would also be difficult to replicate; as allegations of organ harvesting from Falun Gong gained attention, hospitals <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> reluctant to candidly discuss their organ sourcing practices.|$|E
25|$|During Xianghua's early design phase, several {{concepts}} {{were considered}} for her attire, before settling upon {{a light and}} oriental appearance for her. Additionally it was considered to have her appear {{as a young girl}} instead, or alternatively for her to fight unarmed using martial arts, an idea later put to effect through Tekken character Heihachi Mishima in his guest appearance in Soulcalibur II. Xianghua <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> feminized in her clothing {{over the course of the}} series.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{there was}} a brief {{association}} with Miles Davis's quintet featuring Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Tony Williams, although the band was never recorded. Henderson's adaptability and eclecticism <b>would</b> <b>become</b> even <b>more</b> apparent in the years to follow.|$|R
50|$|He {{was married}} to the actress Signe Hagelstam and had three children. His works <b>would</b> {{eventually}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> popular {{after his death in}} 1946 and today he {{is considered one of the}} prime Finnish poets of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|These protests {{became a}} {{catalyst}} for shutting down the numerous adult stores, body rub parlours, and shoeshine stands along Yonge Street. Over time, Yonge Street <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a <b>more</b> conventional district, and new developments such as Dundas Square would revitalize the area.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of these tensions, a {{standoff}} started between the Americans and the Vietnamese generals. The U.S. had hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive without aid from Washington, and {{that they would not be}} able to repel the communists or rival officers without bending to receive support. On the other hand, Khánh hoped the Americans <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> worried about the communists first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC.|$|E
25|$|During early {{experiments}} with LORAN's skywaves, Jack Pierce noticed that {{at night the}} reflective layer in the ionosphere was quite stable. This led {{to the possibility that}} two LORAN stations could be synchronized using skywave signals, at least at night, allowing them to be separated over much greater distances. Accuracy of a hyperbolic system {{is a function of the}} baseline distance, so if the stations could be spread out, the system <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> accurate, so fewer stations would be needed.|$|E
25|$|Zorn {{has written}} music for documentaries, {{underground}} films, television advertisements and cartoons which were released in his Filmworks {{series on the}} Tzadik label. Some of these film scores are jazz-influenced, others classical, and most feature ensembles consisting of rotating combinations of downtown musicians. Zorn has often used his cinematic and television commissions to experiment with line-ups and forms that <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> established parts of his musical canon. Zorn only agrees to composing for film on the condition he retains all rights to any music produced and ensures that all musicians participating in his soundtrack work are appropriately remunerated.|$|E
5000|$|Thousands {{of years}} ago, the Kherubim {{destroyed}} their own planet, according to Titan myth. They then came to Khera and settled it, subjugating the Titans. The Titans <b>would</b> slowly <b>become</b> <b>more</b> or less accepted within the Kherubim society, but remained second-class citizens.|$|R
50|$|The final {{aircraft}} {{was known as}} the Ryan NYP (registration number N-X-211) which captured popular imagination as the Spirit of St. Louis in May 1927 by flying nonstop from New York to Paris. Charles A. Lindbergh <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a worldwide celebrity because of this famous flight and aviation <b>would</b> <b>become</b> much <b>more</b> popular around the globe.|$|R
50|$|The {{proportions}} of the Galaxy-class Enterprise-D were different from the original Enterprise while retaining its familiar dual warp nacelles and saucer section appearance. The nacelles were made proportionally smaller than the saucer section, {{based on the idea}} that warp engines <b>would</b> have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> efficient over time.|$|R
