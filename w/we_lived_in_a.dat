25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

Manning's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: [...] "For weeks <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of recoil". From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy. He invited them to stay at his Garden City flat that overlooked the embassy.|$|E
500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit to my parents. <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lovely terrace house and we all had each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Panait Cerna's {{father was}} an ethnic Bulgarian schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov). He settled in Cerna and married Maria Taşcu. The {{daughter}} of local peasants, she was of Aromanian or of Bulgarian origin. Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian nationalist, refused to accept this change and left for the Principality of Bulgaria, leaving his family behind. Consequently, Cerna never met his father. By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: [...] " [...] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house on the outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms. Can you imagine living {{in the middle of}} winter, without a fire on, with doors that barely close, with windows that are glued with paper? A person made of iron would still feel cold down to the bone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hines {{moved in}} with Kathryn Perry (with whom he had {{recorded}} [...] "Sadie Green the Vamp of New Orleans"). Hines said of her, [...] "She'd been at The Sunset too, in a dance act. She was a very charming, pretty girl. She had a good voice and played the violin. I had been divorced and she became my common-law wife. <b>We</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big apartment and her parents stayed with us". Perry recorded several times with Hines, including [...] "Body & Soul" [...] in 1935. They stayed together until 1940, when Hines [...] "divorced" [...] her to marry Ann Jones Reed, but that marriage was soon [...] "indefinitely postponed".|$|E

It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world. Personally, I always know I'll be able to survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Andrews {{family was}} [...] "very poor and <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bad slum area of London," [...] Andrews recalled, adding, [...] "That {{was a very}} black period in my life." [...] According to Andrews, her {{stepfather}} was violent and an alcoholic. Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door. But, as the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, {{they were able to}} afford to move to better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of Hersham. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.|$|E
