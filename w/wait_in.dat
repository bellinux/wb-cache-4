Eichmann had arrived in Budapest {{as head of the}} Sondereinsatzkommando overseeing the deportation of the Jews. Brand was told to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the Opera Cafḗ and from there was driven by the SS to Eichmann's headquarters at the Hotel Majestic.|$|E
5|$|The ship first reached Cape Mendocino in today's California, {{and then}} {{continued}} {{along the coast}} to arrive in Acapulco on 25 January 1614 after three months at sea. The Japanese were received with great ceremony, but had to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> Acapulco until orders were received regarding how to organize {{the rest of their}} travels.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} episodes were also {{experimental}} {{in that they}} took place entirely in one setting. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam; Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia; Victor left {{alone in the house}} waiting to see if he has to take part in jury service; Victor and Margaret having a long <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), {{thanks to}} his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters {{planning}} to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him materials {{that could be used}} to build a bomb. The crew allow him to take a runabout and to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; matters are further complicated by the arrival of the Cardassian warship.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E
50|$|The next album, {{entitled}} <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> the Wings, {{was recorded}} in 2006 and was mixed and mastered by Tommy Hansen. <b>Waiting</b> <b>in</b> the Wings got even better reviews than Become did, scoring multiple top scores of 10 out of 10,,,, not too common in the business.|$|R

50|$|The Diesel variant has {{attracted}} more attention in India {{because of its}} fuel economy - {{as a result the}} response in India was overwhelming and Hyundai could not handle all the orders. There are delays expected with 2-3-month <b>waits</b> <b>in</b> most locations and up to 5-month <b>waits</b> <b>in</b> others.|$|R
5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur <b>Wait</b> <b>in</b> early 1966. Head had been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players new and old, and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates {{at the beginning of}} the season, finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E
5|$|GateKeeper's {{entrance}} plaza {{is located}} {{along the beach}} {{next to one of}} Wicked Twister's towers. A sculpture with the GateKeeper logo is {{in the center of the}} plaza. The queue runs parallel to the beach, under the lift hill and station. Once under the station, riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride. GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> a shorter line.|$|E
5|$|His loss {{of faith}} in human {{relationships}} is mirrored in his loss {{of faith in}} God. During the first night, {{as he and his}} father <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} waiting time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, {{waiting to be}} served decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. <b>In</b> this system, <b>waiting</b> can be classified into two: <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> and <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> service where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> differs <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting,</b> <b>in</b> service <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to <b>wait.</b> <b>In</b> May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E
5|$|The booked service allowed {{two options}} of fees. The Transit Booking System, {{available}} online, allowing customers {{who do not}} want to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder. The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships, containerships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} bookings {{for the film}} opened, a {{reported}} crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. The tickets, the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, {{to the extent that}} police intervention was required. It was reported that people would <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through their family members. Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.|$|E

5|$|United States Army Private Witt goes AWOL {{from his}} unit and lives among the {{carefree}} Melanesian natives in the South Pacific. He is found and imprisoned on a troop carrier by First Sergeant Welsh of his company. The men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division {{have been brought}} to Guadalcanal as reinforcements in the campaign to secure Henderson Field and seize the island from the Japanese. As they <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> a Navy transport, they contemplate their lives and the invasion. Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Tall talks with Brigadier General Quintard about the invasion and its importance.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost all white as the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they would <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|Disobeying {{his orders}} {{to return to}} Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, {{gathered}} the convoy, and escorted them to Britain. It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth £1 million, {{and would have been}} at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort. However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of Trustys officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy. The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port. There it was suggested that he <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council.|$|E

5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
