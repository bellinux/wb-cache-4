5|$|General Tilney {{returns home}} from a trip away and orders Eleanor to send Catherine home to Fullerton that night. Catherine endures the trip alone and {{believes}} that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led him to believe. He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.|$|E
5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter {{the product of a}} gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested that}} if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> shortened.|$|E

5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{expansion}} northwards from the city center to Åsane involve either building the system to replace many of the local buses operating in Sandviken, or make the light rail line an express service. If the latter is chosen, the line will bypass Bryggen in a tunnel and make few stops before Åsane. An important stop mid-way is the Norwegian School of Economics. The terminus <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> Åsane Senter or Nyborg; the former shopping center has set aside areas for a station. At Åsane, a major bus terminal would allow connections to the northern parts of Bergen, suburbs further north and areas in Nordhordland. An important political argument for prioritizing this line is to spread out the investments to {{all parts of the}} city, since the line is being financed by taxpayers and car-users throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

25|$|The EMU is now {{waiting in}} the SKM sheds in Gdynia Cisowa and <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> used as an old-style {{customer}} service office {{on one of the}} stops. The train is well preserved and SKM officials say the renovation will not be difficult.|$|E
25|$|A second ring line, {{further from}} the centre than the {{existing}} one, has also been discussed. However, light rail <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> constructed instead. Connecting Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, to the network has been proposed, although it is already served by both regional trains and the Copenhagen Metro.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} plans to line E, which <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> circular. The exact route {{has not yet been}} determined. In the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, there were discussions regarding it in the connection with plans to organise the Summer Olympic Games in Prague, which were however canceled.|$|E
25|$|The use of evidentiality has pragmatic {{implications}} in languages {{that do not}} mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality. For example, {{a person}} who makes a false statement qualified as a belief may be considered mistaken; a person who makes a false statement qualified as a personally observed fact <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> considered to have lied.|$|E

25|$|Scholars Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu suggest {{reforms in}} law {{enforcement}} procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be {{an alternative to the}} raid and rescue model.|$|E
25|$|Fermi {{estimates}} generally {{work because}} the estimations {{of the individual}} terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, {{if there is no}} consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> more accurate than might be first supposed.|$|E

While {{some of the great}} players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.|$|E

25|$|Here in {{my opinion}} is the only imaginative prose-writer of the {{slightest}} value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth {{more than a single}} glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.|$|E
