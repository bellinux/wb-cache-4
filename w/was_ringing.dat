25|$|Vance wrote many {{science fiction}} short {{stories in the}} late 1940s and through the 1950s, which were {{published}} in magazines. Of his novels written during this period, a few were science fiction, but most were mysteries. Few were published at the time, but Vance continued to write mysteries into the early 1970s. In total, he wrote 15 novels outside of science fiction and fantasy, including the extended outline, The Telephone <b>was</b> <b>Ringing</b> in the Dark, published only by the VIE (Vance Integral Edition), and three books published under the Ellery Queen pseudonym. Some of these are not mysteries, such as Bird Island, and many fit uneasily in the category. These stories are set in and around his native San Francisco, except for one set in Italy and another in Africa. Two begin in San Francisco but take to the sea.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, the {{category}} of rings, denoted by Ring, is {{the category}} whose objects <b>are</b> <b>rings</b> (with identity) and whose morphisms <b>are</b> <b>ring</b> homomorphisms (preserving the identity).

50|$|In {{commutative}} algebra, a J-0 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} the set of regular points of the spectrum contains a non-empty open subset, a J-1 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{such that the}} set of regular points of the spectrum is an open subset, and a J-2 <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> such that any finitely generated algebra over the <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a J-1 <b>ring.</b>|$|R

50|$|A homocycle or homocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{in which}} all atoms are of the same {{chemical}} element. A heterocycle or heterocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> containing atoms {{of at least two}} different elements, i.e. a non-homocyclic ring. A carbocycle or carbocyclic <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a homocyclic <b>ring</b> {{in which all}} of the atoms are carbon. An important class of carbocycles <b>are</b> alicyclic <b>rings,</b> and an important subclass of these are cycloalkanes.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a <b>ring</b> {{in which}} every element can be written as the sum of a unit and an idempotent. A <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> a local <b>ring</b> {{if and only if}} it is clean and has no idempotents other than 0 and 1. The {{endomorphism}} ring of a continuous module <b>is</b> a clean <b>ring.</b> Every clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> an exchange <b>ring.</b> A matrix ring over a clean <b>ring</b> <b>is</b> itself clean.|$|R
