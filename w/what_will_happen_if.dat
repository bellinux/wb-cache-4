The remaining boys attempt to warn their mothers about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Terrance and Phillip are killed, but they are laughed at, and Mr. Garrison activates the electric chair. A Canadian force attacks the base and a battle ensues between the two armies. In the confusion, the boys are able to free Terrance and Phillip, though Cartman's V-chip begins to malfunction.

25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward {{for the return of}} Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

Moore and the agents are engulfed by the insects, which enter the vehicle through the air conditioning.

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, but I think it was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Michael does not lift." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{research}} {{seems to}} be unanimous; a stable, secure, loving, honest and supportive family in which all members feel safe to explore their identity {{is necessary for the}} formation of a sound identity. Transracial and International adoptions are some factors that {{play a significant role in}} the identity construction of adoptees. Many tensions arise from relationships built between the adoptee(s) and their family. These include being [...] "different" [...] from the parent(s), developing a positive racial identity, and dealing with racial/ethnic discrimination. It has been found that multicultural and transnational youth tend to identify with their parents origin of culture and ethnicity rather than their residing location, yet it is sometimes hard to balance an identity between the two because school environments tend to lack diversity and acknowledgment regarding such topics. These tensions also tend to create questions for the adoptee, as well as the family, to contemplate. Some common questions include <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> the family is more naïve to the ways of socially constructed life? Will tensions arise if this is the case? What if the very people that are supposed to be modeling a sound identity are in fact riddled with insecurities? Ginni Snodgrass answers these questions in the following way.|$|E
