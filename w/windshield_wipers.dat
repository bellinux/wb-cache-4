25|$|The {{effect that}} <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> {{have on a}} {{vehicles}} airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
25|$|From March, {{features}} such as Xenon headlamps, rain-sensitive <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> headlight washers, GPS navigation, and upgraded audio became standard for US models.|$|E
5000|$|Windshield Wiper/360 Windshield Wiper: The rider spins a tailwhip and, {{while still}} in the air, spins another tailwhip back the other way. Matt Sparks was the first rider {{to do it on}} a BMX bike in 2006, calling it a <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper.</b> A 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is when the rider spins a 360 degree {{rotation}} while doing a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> at the same time. James foster did it in 2008 at the Jomopro contest in Joplin, MO. Foster also landed it in the fifth Cameron White Annual Dirt Jam. The trick has also been pulled by Kyle Baldock, Alessandro Barbero, among others. Baldock landed a 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> to late tailwhip at the 2011 Salt Lake City Dew Tour. At the Dew Tour in Orlando, FL in 2009, T.J. Ellis pulled the world's first <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper</b> Backflip.|$|R

50|$|Mary Anderson (February 19, 1866 - June 27, 1953) was an American {{real estate}} developer, rancher, {{viticulturist}} and {{inventor of the}} <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> blade.

25|$|The {{windshield}} wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson {{is credited with}} inventing the first operational {{windshield wiper}}. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|E
25|$|Lens {{cleaning}} systems come in {{two main}} varieties: a small motor-driven rubber wiper or brush conceptually similar to <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> or a fixed or telescopic high-pressure sprayer which cleans the lenses with a spray of windshield washer fluid. Most recent lens cleaning systems are of the spray type, because UN regulations do not permit mechanical cleaning systems (wipers) {{to be used with}} plastic-lens headlamps, and most recent headlamps have plastic lenses. Some cars with retractable headlamps, such as the original Mazda MX-5, have a squeegee {{at the front of the}} lamp recess which automatically wipes the lenses as they are raised or lowered, although it does not provide washer fluid.|$|E

50|$|Heavily {{favored to}} win the Messenger Stakes and sweep the Triple Crown, Keystone Ore fell to <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper,</b> who {{finished}} three-quarters of a length ahead of Keystone Ore. Both Keystone Ore and <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper</b> had started in the second tier of the 11-horse race and were hemmed in on the rail. On the backstretch for the second time, both horses found room to the outside around the stretch turn with <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper</b> pulling away in the last 50 yards. Keystone Ore had beaten <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper</b> in 13 of their races, but lost when the two competed against each other at Freehold Raceway in a race held {{two weeks before the}} Messenger Stakes. Keystone Ore finished the season with earnings of $469,302, and a win in the Messenger would not only have earned the Triple Crown but would have put the horse just short of the single-season harness horse earnings record of $558,009 set by Albatross in 1971.|$|R

25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed side moulding, turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new split 5-spoke alloy wheels. Memory seating, rain-sensing <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard.
