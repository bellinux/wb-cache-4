5|$|Cassette {{copies of}} the band's first album, Opium, began {{circulating}} through the underground clubs and bars of Hamburg in 1984. KMFDM released its next album, <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> Deutschland?, in December 1986. It was recorded from 1983 to 1986, {{with some of the}} songs recorded by Konietzko and Watts before Esch {{was a member of the}} band, and indeed, before the band officially existed. Skysaw Records gave the album a second UK release in 1987 and introduced the band to visual artist Aidan Hughes, usually credited as Brute!. Hughes redesigned the album's cover, and went on to design almost every KMFDM album cover.|$|E
500|$|As of July 2007, KMFDM {{had sold}} {{approximately}} two million records worldwide. Critics {{have been widely}} positive of KMFDM, though less enthusiastic about the band's earliest work. <b>What</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> Deutschland? was called [...] "less energetic" [...] and Don't Blow Your Top was called [...] "a little flimsy" [...] in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries, respectively. UAIOE, when the band's sound began to develop, was called [...] "more assured" [...] by Hinds and [...] "more representative of KMFDM's true motives" [...] by Thompson, who added that KMFDM's guitar-heavy sound inspired Ministry's own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} and loss left Lenore in emotional pain. [...] In her election night remarks she had said, [...] "I thought [...] {{would be an}} asset. It was disappointing to find that many people closed their minds just because I was a woman." [...] She expounded on this in an article she published the following year in Look magazine, describing the openly dismissive reaction she had gotten from both men and women. She wrote that, [...] "In factories, I encountered men in small groups, laughing, shouting, 'Get in the kitchen. George needs you there. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about politics?'" [...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep." [...] She told one of her children that {{she wished she had}} not run, and concluded that [...] "It's the most humiliating thing I know of to run for office." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Vervain; [...] "it's {{very good}} of you to say so, Mr. Ferris, and it's very gratifying, all round; but don't you see, it doesn't serve the present purpose. <b>What</b> teachers <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of?" ...|$|R
