5|$|After {{moving to}} London, Stearn {{produced}} a steady output of publications {{during his years}} at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952). These covered {{a wide range of}} topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on Vinca, Epimedium and Lilium. Within two years of joining the Library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale <b>Woodcock</b> and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as <b>Woodcock</b> and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae sensu lato. While at the Library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the Code of Botanical Nomenclature (see Botanical taxonomy).|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{what part}} each {{played in the}} authorship is unknown. At the time, Grave {{asserted}} that he had authored the manifesto and that Kropotkin had revised it. Alternatively, Gregori Maximoff reported that Kropotkin had written the document and that Grave had merely advised minor alterations. George <b>Woodcock</b> noted that the work seems to be highly influenced by Kropotkin's common concerns and arguments against the German Empire, and so felt that the exact authorship was unimportant.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWintering birds face a {{trade-off}} between starvation and predation risk. In Eurasian <b>woodcocks,</b> Scolopax rusticola, habitat use may reflect this trade-off because meadows, where most birds spend the night, {{are characterized by}} {{a higher risk of}} predation and a higher biomass of food (earthworms) than the woods, used by day. We monitored activity of 34 <b>woodcocks</b> fitted with tiltswitch radiotags. Young birds were more active than adults, probably because they were less efficient at foraging. In general, nocturnal activity was inversely correlated with air temperature and with daylight foraging activity, suggesting some compensatory mechanism, modulated by thermoregulatory constraints. Individual activity patterns differed, and we classified <b>woodcocks</b> according to three main wintering strategies: ‘always', ‘sometimes' or ‘never' visiting fields at night. The decision to fly to fields at night seemed to be taken every evening, according to the amount of daylight foraging activity in woods and the air temperature. After feeding in a rich patch of food on a mild day, <b>woodcocks</b> did not have to risk going to meadows. Conversely, in patches of fewer food resources or at lower temperatures or both, <b>woodcocks</b> could not meet all their energy requirements without going to fields at night (where there was always sufficient food) and eventually, changing their diurnal sites. Therefore, the trade-off between feeding and predation risk depends on how efficiently birds find a rich patch of food in the forest and exploit it optimally during the day...|$|R
5|$|The French Spaniel {{was little}} known outside France and {{neighboring}} countries {{until it was}} introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular dog for hunting <b>woodcock</b> and grouse. The Club de l'Épagneul Français du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club, by which the breed was recognised in 1985.|$|E
5|$|According to the English {{officers}} of arms John Martin Robinson and Thomas <b>Woodcock,</b> crests {{have played a}} relatively insignificant role in Scottish heraldry when compared to English heraldry. In consequence many Scottish armigers, including clan chiefs, have comparatively similar crests to one another. Because of this, crest badges can sometimes show an obvious association with another clan. For example, clans associated with the Chattan Confederation share very similar crest badges bearing wild cats. Clans associated with Clan MacTavish Clan Campbell of Breadalbane, Clan MacIver and Clan Campbell use a crest badges which contain similar crests and mottoes that allude {{to that of the}} chief of Clan MacTavish.|$|E
5|$|The word spanyell {{is thought}} to date from the late 12th century when {{it was used to}} name a type of dog {{imported}} into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing <b>woodcock.</b>|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican <b>woodcock</b> (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|England {{reached the}} final again in 2007, where they faced South Africa, {{who had won}} 36–0 when the two teams met during the pool stage. South African full-back Percy Montgomery scored three {{penalties}} to Wilkinson's one to give South Africa a 9–3 lead at half-time. England had a try disallowed in the first minutes of the second half, when Mark Cueto was adjudged {{to be in touch}} before scoring. A penalty from Wilkinson and a further two from Montgomery reduced the gap but did not prevent South Africa from winning 15–6 and secure their second World Cup victory. The 2011 final pitted hosts New Zealand against France {{for the second time in}} the tournament, after their first encounter in the pool stage resulted in a 37–17 win for New Zealand. The host team scored the first points of the match, with a try in the 15th minute through prop Tony <b>Woodcock.</b> Nine minutes later, New Zealand's third-choice fly-half Aaron Cruden went off injured and was replaced by Stephen Donald, who had only been called into the squad following injuries to first-choice fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade. Donald extended New Zealand's lead in the second half with a penalty; a minute later, French captain Thierry Dusautoir scored a try, which was converted by François Trinh-Duc to leave France one point behind New Zealand. Despite constant pressure from the French for the remainder of the final, they were unable to score more points and New Zealand won the match 8–7 to lift their second World Cup trophy.|$|E
5|$|Sussex {{began their}} run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, {{surviving}} a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb {{shortly before the}} final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset did make a breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. <b>Woodcock</b> thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year. Parker scored the winning runs to secure a five-wicket victory for Sussex with 41 deliveries remaining.|$|E

5|$|The Sussex captain, Arnold Long, won the toss {{and chose}} to bowl first, hoping that morning dew might give his bowlers an advantage. Brian Rose scored 14 {{runs from the}} first over, bowled by Imran, who later took Somerset's first wicket, bowling Denning before the batsman had scored a run. That brought Richards to the crease, and Long {{immediately}} changed both of his bowlers, replacing the quick bowling of the openers with the slower deliveries of Giles Cheatle and John Spencer. Cheatle dismissed Rose in his first over, caught down the leg side by the wicket-keeper, Long after scoring 44 runs. Peter Roebuck also got out to Cheatle, scoring nine runs before being caught by Mendis. Botham joined Richards in the middle, and immediately scored a four with a straight drive, followed by two hooks for sixes. Cheatle and Spencer each bowled their entire allocation of 12 overs without a break, and were followed {{by the introduction of}} another slow bowler, John Barclay. Although Richards finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, <b>Woodcock</b> said that he struggled to score fluently, particularly against the spin bowling of Barclay and Cheatle. In the Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks summary of the season, Jack Alridge praised Long's captaincy in the final, highlighting the use of slower bowling against Richards and Ian Botham as being particularly commendable. Vic Marks, who also played in the match for Somerset, suggested that Botham was the only Somerset batsman to play with freedom, and said {{that the rest of the}} team were nervous and intimidated by the prospect of winning Somerset's first trophy. Richards scored 44 runs, and Botham 80, including three sixes, but none of the rest of the middle- or lower-order batsmen made a significant score and Somerset finished their innings on 207 for 7. Along with Barclay, Spencer bowled particularly economically for Sussex.|$|E
