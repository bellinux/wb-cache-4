40|$|International audienceLegumes {{are major}} plants for {{sustainable}} agriculture because legumes fix atmospheric N 2 in symbiosis with soil bacteria. Previous investigations {{have attempted to}} increase N 2 fixation by creating hypernodulating mutants for several legume species. However, such genetic mutation has failed to increase symbiotic fixation because hypernodulation is usually associated with depressed plant growth. Such failure is due to our lack of knowledge on the mechanisms of carbon flow. In particular, the impact of hypernodulation on carbon uptake and partitioning between the shoot, roots and nodules has never been quantified. Here we grew two wild pea genotypes and nine hypernodulating pea mutants in hydroponics. Measurements were made {{at the end of}} the vegetative period. We counted the nodules: for pea mutants, nodule number ranged from 500 to 2, 600 per plant using genetic and allele strength variation. For pea <b>wild</b> <b>types,</b> nodule number ranged from 184 to 955 per plant, using environmental manipulation. We also measured carbon nutrition traits such as leaf area, radiation use efficiency for biomass production and biomass partitioning among shoot, roots and nodules. Relationships between nodule number and traits were analysed within hypernodulating mutants. Those relationships were then compared to those obtained for <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> Our results show that total nodule biomass increases with nodule number for hypernodulating mutants and <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> Mean nodule size decreases with nodule number for hypernodulating mutants and <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> For mutants, root growth was reduced from 60  % for the lower hypernodulating to 80  % for the higher hypernodulating, compared to <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> For mutants, shoot growth was reduced from 0  % for the lower hypernodulating to 60  % for the higher hypernodulating, compared to <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> Evidence for decreased C uptake capacity is shown by 50  % less leaf area and 18  % less radiation use efficiency of the higher hypernodulating phenotypes. This is the first whole plant comparative study of hypernodulating mutants and <b>wild</b> <b>types</b> revealing relationships between carbon nutrition and nodule gradients.

5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the signal transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is implied}} that suberized apoplastic {{barriers}} of roots negatively correlate {{with water and}} solute permeabilities, direct transport measurements across roots with altered amounts and compositions of aliphatic suberin are scarce. In the present study, hydroponically grown Arabidopsis <b>wild</b> <b>types</b> (Col 8 and Col 0) and different suberin mutants with altered amounts and/or compositions (horst, esb 1 - 1, and esb 1 - 2) were used to test this hypothesis. Detailed histochemical studies revealed late development of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in the horst mutant compared with <b>wild</b> <b>types</b> and esb mutants. Suberin analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the horst mutant had ∼ 33 % lower amounts of aliphatic monomers than Col 8 and Col 0. In contrast, enhanced suberin mutants (esb 1 - 1 and esb 1 - 2) had twice the amount of suberin as the <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> Correlative permeability measurements, which were carried {{out for the first}} time with a root pressure probe for Arabidopsis, revealed that the hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and NaCl permeability (Psr) of the whole root system of the horst mutant were markedly greater than in the respective <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> This was reflected by the total amounts of aliphatic suberin determined in the roots. However, increased levels of aliphatic suberin in esb mutants failed to reduce either water or NaCl permeabilities below those of the <b>wild</b> <b>types.</b> It was concluded that the simple view and the conventional assumption that the amount of root suberin negatively correlates with permeability may not always be true. The aliphatic monomer arrangement in the suberin biopolymer and its microstructure also play a role in apoplastic barrier formation...|$|R

The naturally occurring (<b>wild</b> <b>type)</b> p53 is widely involved in cellular processes, including autophagy, response to DNA damage, cell cycle regulation and senescence, apoptosis and the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. The gene encoding p53 is inactivated by E6 at the protein level and is found as the <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> in HPV+OPC but mutated in HPV-OPC. In HPV+OPC p53 protein undergoes accelerated degradation by E6, drastically reducing its levels, while in HPV-OPC it undergoes genetic mutation, which may result in synthesis of an abnormal p53 protein, that may not only be inactive as a tumour suppressor, but can also bind and inactivate any non-mutated <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> p53, {{with an increase in}} oncogenic activity.

25|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure {{the expression of a}} set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells {{at the same time as}} in the <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and <b>wild</b> <b>type</b> cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.|$|E
