5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Lord High Steward's Court.|$|E

5|$|Cubeb {{was thought}} {{by the people}} of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people of China.

5|$|Dumouriez {{would bear}} a harsh change of fortune: after one more {{influential}} success in November 1792 at Jemappes, he <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> following year a broken man. His army had suffered such catastrophic losses that he defected to the royalist side {{for the rest}} of his life. Kellermann, however, continued in a long and distinguished military career.

5|$|He {{appealed to}} the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) {{that they did not}} have the {{jurisdiction}} to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of habeas corpus is issued (as it <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it. After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) he was finally released on 16 May.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially {{to gain control}} of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{estimate of}} the temperature of outer space <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896.

British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8K in 1933.|$|E

5|$|With {{new players}} and using Chapman's system, Huddersfield were transformed. They {{finished}} third in 1922–23 {{and went on to}} win their first League title in 1923–24. This success <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> narrowest of margins – equal on points with Cardiff City, Huddersfield won by a difference of 0.024 (1.818 to 1.794) in goal average.

5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were Amish, shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was a}} four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. The power of the Gestapo included what was called, Schutzhaft ("protective custody"), a euphemism for the power to arrest and imprison people without judicial proceedings.|$|E
