25|$|Robert the Devil's 1881 {{campaign}} {{began with}} an anti-climax as no owner entered a horse to oppose him in the Rosebery Plate at Newmarket, allowing him to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> claim the prize money. On June 3,at the Derby meeting, Robert the Devil met Bend Or {{for the fifth time}} in the Epsom Gold Gup, over the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Derby winner was in good form, having produced an impressive weight-carrying performance to win the City and Suburban Handicap in April. With other intended runners dropping out the race became a match, attracting extraordinary interest and provoking unprecedented scenes of excitement. Robert the Devil set off in front, and Archer followed close behind on Bend Or. Approaching the final furlong, Archer made his move, sending Bend Or into the lead. On this occasion, Robert the Devil could not respond and Bend Or appeared to have won rather more easily than the neck margin suggested.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Bubbles and Jackson were {{photographed by}} Kenny Rogers for his book, Your Friends and Mine. The photo shows Bubbles held on Jackson's hip, {{and has been}} cited {{as one of the}} best taken of Jackson. In the black and white photograph, Bubbles is dressed casually in a long sleeved shirt and overalls. Jackson is also dressed casually; he wears jeans and a simple shirt. Rogers said: [...] "Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher [...] by the hand, <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the refrigerator, open it, take out a banana and hand it to him. Christopher was amazed... we all were." ...|$|E
500|$|When Storm {{became a}} {{professional}} singer, {{he changed his}} name to Rory Storm by deed poll, and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to Stormsville. Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink Vauxhall Cresta for £800 in cash. A young man was once caught by a porter at Bootle railway station writing [...] "I love Rory" [...] over the walls, and when questioned, {{it turned out to be}} Storm himself. The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm sometimes wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts he would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the piano and comb his blond hair with an oversized comb. Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree-decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits. Storm also wore an Elvis-style gold lamé suit. When they first appeared at Butlins holiday camp Storm wore a turquoise suit with a gold lamé shirt, while the group wore fluorescent suits.|$|E

500|$|NBC's {{preparations}} for the Sunday, November 17 game at Oakland were routine. The game was to be televised {{to most of the}} country beginning at 4:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time, with Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis announcing. NBC hoped that viewers who tuned their television channel selectors to the game would not <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the television and change the channel or turn off the power switch, but would watch the evening's programming. They anticipated a good game, which would cause the audience to remain in their seats and watch the game in its entirety, [...] "a perfect lead in for the network's special presentation of Heidi, the Johanna Spyri children's classic, which was scheduled to air after the game at 7p.m. (EST)". The television film was preempting Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, the program normally shown by NBC on Sunday at that time. As the game started at 1:00p.m. Pacific Standard Time, the western half of the country would have to wait after the game for 7:00p.m. local time before seeing Heidi. Under television rules at the time, the Jets–Raiders game was blacked out within 90 miles of Oakland {{even though it was a}} sellout, leaving KRON-TV (channel 4, the local NBC affiliate serving Oakland at the time), and other NBC affiliates in nearby markets unable to show the game.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{said the}} latter, with {{something}} of his usual briskness; [...] "if {{you are still}} in the humor, suppose we <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Lethbury." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he may be}} able to give us some information," [...] Louise asserted; [...] "so I propose we <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the town}} {{tomorrow}} morning and interview him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] replied Selwyn briskly. [...] "I'll <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Wish-ton-wish. Ifs {{only half}} a mile across lots. I suppose the old way is still open?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} extension bell rang. Nigel <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the sideboard and {{took down the}} receiver.|$|R

6000|$|... "Entirely too modest," [...] she answered. [...] "Let us <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> this {{bench in}} the shade. You are not desired at the house; {{everybody}} is taking a nap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was arranged," [...] Dane {{answered}} ambiguously. [...] "You see, {{he was a}} countryman; and {{the poor}} fellow died soon afterward, anyway. I think I shall <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Culmeny." ...|$|E
60|$|At the Junction {{the boys}} had to wait {{about half an hour}} for the train to Oakdale. Dave {{suggested}} that they <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a candy store and have some soda water.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he turned}} his back and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> where Riggs sat nursing a bullet-burn on his leg.|$|R
60|$|He came out, smiling falsely at the crowd, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where his}} balloon swayed in the air.|$|R
60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} mate stood, {{close to the}} wheelhouse, giving {{directions}} to the pilot of the Rainbow.|$|R

60|$|For reply I <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the slatted {{window and}} began to whistle. My action only {{increased}} the merchant's anger.|$|R
60|$|I was grievously puzzled at all this, and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the other}} tree, followed, as before, by Euphemia and Pomona.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a second}} pause she continued: [...] "What {{is it my}} duty and wisdom to do next? Not to stay here inactive, I am glad to say, but, of course, to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Hollow." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{returned}} to the station, and it was not long before the train could be seen approaching in the distance. Along with a number of others, Richard started to <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the right track.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} Richard sent the pension papers to Frank {{by the first}} mail. Then he helped get {{what was left of}} their {{furniture}} into shape, and took a <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> what had been the old homestead.|$|E
