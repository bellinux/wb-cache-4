40|$|A t several {{hospitals}} in California, Department of Health Care Servicesinspections required under Medicare and Medicaid “conditions ofparticipation ” {{have resulted in}} findings of non-compliance related {{to the use of}} selected drugs with FDA-mandated <b>boxed</b> <b>warnings</b> (“black <b>box</b> warnings”) in their package labeling. Medications implicated included droperidol. At one institution, a finding of “immediate jeopardy”—the highest level of non-compliance—was cited in relation to droperidol use. Many facilities now have removed droperidol from their formularies in order to avoid such regulatory penalties and any accompanying fines. The propriety of the FDA <b>boxed</b> <b>warning</b> for droperidol has been challenged for years, as is well documented in the medical literature. The <b>boxed</b> <b>warning</b> recommends limiting the use of droperidol to patients who fail to respond to other antiemetics, and it states that a pretreatment 12 -lead ECG analysis should occur, followed by continuous ECG monitoring for two to three hours after administration out of concern for serious dysrhythmias.

50|$|Economists and {{physicians}} have thoroughly studied {{the effects of}} FDA <b>boxed</b> <b>warnings</b> on prescription patterns. It is not necessarily true that a physician and patient will have a conversation about a drug's <b>boxed</b> <b>warning</b> after it is issued. For instance, an FDA-mandated <b>boxed</b> <b>warning</b> decreased rosiglitazone use by 70%, but that still meant 3.8 million people were given the drug. Later research indicated that after receiving an FDA advisory, there was a decrease in rosiglitazone use, due to a combined effect of media exposure, advisory, and scientific publications, whereas pioglitazone (with a similar advisory but less media exposure) did not similarly decrease in use. This challenges the idea that physicians and patients will have a conversation after a <b>boxed</b> <b>warning</b> is issued. Throughout the country, <b>boxed</b> <b>warnings</b> will be translated into prescription patterns differently by different physicians.|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{promoting}} informed consumer assent through quixotic attempts to have consumers read ever-expanding disclosures, this Article argues that consumer protection law {{should focus on}} 2 ̆ 2 term optimism 2 ̆ 2 -situations in which consumers expect more favorable terms than they actually receive. We propose a system under which mass-market sellers are required periodically {{to engage in a}} process of 2 ̆ 2 term substantiation 2 ̆ 2 through which sellers would learn whether their consumers held accurate beliefs about the terms of their agreement. Terms that meet or exceed the median consumer 2 ̆ 7 s expectation would be enforceable even if buried or only available on request. But sellers could enforce unexpected, unfavorable terms only if they are disclosed in a 2 ̆ 2 <b>warning</b> <b>box</b> 2 ̆ 2 that has a government- provided standard border. To prevent overuse of the box, sellers would need (i) to exclude terms from the box that meet or exceed consumer expectations and (ii) to order terms in the box in descending order of consumer importance. Such a system of term substantiation coupled with targeted warnings about unexpected terms jettisons as unworkable the duty to read ideal. It instead economizes on consumers 2 ̆ 7 scarce attention by increasing the salience of those terms that are most likely to inhibit informed consent. Term substantiation lets the representative consumer determine what sellers disclose and thus democratizes the content of form contracts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop teaching media for mathematics specifically for materials on trigonometry using GUI Matlab. This media can be used as teaching and learning aid for students at senior high school, grade XI in the fir st semester. This intructional media consists of instructions on how to use the media, learning materials, exe rcises and profile. The trigonometry materials which are discussed in this intructional media consist of the sum and difference of two angles. The limitation on the angles that can be used are special angles in the intervval - 360 o ???,??? 360 o. The special angles are 0 o, ? 30 o, ? 45 o, ? 60 o, ? 90 o, ? 120 o, ? 135 o, ? 150 o, ? 180 o, ? 210 o, ? 225 o, ? 240 o, ? 270 o, ? 300 o, ? 315 o, ? 330 o, and ? 360 o. The trigonometry functions such as sinus, cosine and as well as the operation addition (+) and subtraction (-) can be selected by hitting the appropriate butto n. Within each step, there is a check button and a next b utton to check the input true or false. If the value that entered incorrectly then the next step will not displayed and <b>warning</b> <b>box</b> will appear to report the location of error. Users have to fix the error in order to continue t o the next step. Keywords: teaching intructional media, trigonometry, GUI MatlabBanda Ace...|$|E

50|$|In the U.S., the National Weather Service uses zone forecasts, where {{generally}} each {{county is}} a zone. For counties near the ocean, there are normally two zones: coastal and inland. The {{same is true}} for counties that are part mountainous and part lowland, or for counties that are quite long. This older system is not used for warnings, which are based on FIPS codes (two digits for the state, three for the county or independent city), with the initial digit being for optional sub-county divisions.
