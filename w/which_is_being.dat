The following morning, Jack discovers that C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional subsidiary of General Electric (GE) and owner of NBC, the company that Jack works for.

5|$|Since 1993, the Commune urbaine d'Antananarivo (CUA) has {{increasingly}} sought {{to protect and}} restore the city's architectural and cultural heritage. In 2005, CUA authorities partnered with the city planners of the Île-de-France to develop the Plan VertPlan Bleu strategy for creating a classification system for Zones de Protection du Patrimoine Architectural, Urbain et Paysager, {{areas of the city}} benefiting from legal protection and financial support for their historic and cultural heritage. The plan, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> implemented by the Institut des Métiers de la Ville, prevents the destruction of historic buildings and other structures, and establishes construction codes that ensure new structures follow historic aesthetics. It also provides for awareness raising campaigns in favor of historic preservation and undertakes projects to restore dilapidated historic buildings and sites. Under this plan, 19th-century sites, like the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal and the second residence of Rainilaiarivony, have been renovated.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar; a nanite bomb turns the entire city into grey goo, with the staff and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time.

5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
