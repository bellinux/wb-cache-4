5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi. Cervi hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production, with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. After producer Dino De Laurentiis saw the footage that had been shot, he halted production on the film, had a new screenplay developed, and hired a new director and cast. This resulted in Bava directing the film on a much lower budget, with more well-known actors taking smaller roles. Many of {{the cast and crew}} members <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> from Barbarella, De Laurentiis' other comic book {{adaptation of}} that year.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{external}} studios <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> to help {{complete the}} project within the short development time.

Still, the division's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The Chagos Islands are {{a cluster}} of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First {{occupied}} by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.|$|E

5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by the British, the other at Omaha by the Americans. Severe storms on 19 June interrupted the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was able to receive around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous use {{for the next ten}} months, but most shipments <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|E

5|$|The {{radio station}} played {{a vital role}} during the Second World War in {{maintaining}} communications with the British merchant navy and with patrol aircraft in the North Atlantic. During the war, all communications with ships were one-way {{in order to avoid}} revealing the ships' locations to the enemy. The station was short-staffed because many were on secondments to various government services, such as operating other radio stations and training new radio officers to work in naval convoys. In 1943, the workload was so great that a Royal Navy officer and 18 telegraphists <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> from HMS Flowerdown, a Naval Shore Wireless Service station near Winchester.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel.

The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in.</b> Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{battalion}} {{remained in the}} Kairivu area throughout September and into early October, when the majority of {{the battalion}} moved back to Wewak. Patrols were sent out into the surrounding areas as Japanese soldiers <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> for surrender and repatriation. Meanwhile, the demobilisation process began with high priority long service troops being repatriated to Australia in drafts as shipping became available. At this time, some of the battalion's personnel volunteered for service in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The majority of these were transferred to the 67th Infantry Battalion, although some also served in the 66th Infantry Battalion. By November, the battalion was down to a posted strength of just 375 personnel. On 18 December 1945, the remaining cadre of the battalion embarked for Australia. As personnel marched out of the unit – either for demobilisation or for subsequent service – and equipment was handed back, the unit was disbanded at Puckapunyal in February 1946.|$|E
