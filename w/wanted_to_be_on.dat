Growing up, Greenwald {{had no plans to}} be a wrestler, but she was {{interested}} in appearing on American Gladiators. She trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18, and at age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75pounds) for her age group by lifting 100pounds. She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not because she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> TV.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E

Mick McConnell, one of the band's road crew and their guitar technician replaced him as the group's new lead guitarist, this formation recording the next album, Wild Horses – The Nashville Album (1998), in Nashville, Tennessee. In February 2001, Smokie released two albums, Uncovered and Uncovered Too, which consist entirely of cover versions, with no original songs.|$|E

25|$|The others leave but {{a moment}} later Poirot suffers a small {{collapse}} and has Margot fetch back Dr. Sheppard. Poirot recovers quickly and, asking the doctor his opinion of the night’s events, is accused of playing a comedy. Poirot disagrees and confirms that he knows who the murderer is and for them {{there can be no}} escape. He takes the doctor through his thinking: The mysterious telephone call can only be judged from its result, which is that Sir Roger’s death was discovered that night instead of the next day. That means that the murderer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the spot when the discovery was made, perhaps to retrieve something. The second puzzling fact was the armchair pulled out from its normal place in the study and that can only have been to have hidden something from sight at the moment that the room was broken into. As the Dictaphone is missing, it can only be that item which was there and, by use of a time-lock, the voice heard behind the door was not that of the living Sir Roger but a previously-made recording – the man was already dead. The murderer can only be someone who had a receptacle to carry away the machine and who had the study to himself for a moment after the discovery of the body – in other word’s, Dr. Sheppard himself.|$|E
500|$|In general, the First Lady's {{desire for}} {{everything}} to appear just {{right in the}} White House led the residence staff to consider her not easy to work for, with tirades following what she perceived as mistakes. One staffer later recalled, [...] "I remember hearing her call for her personal maid one day and it scared the dickens out of me—just her tone. I never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{the wrong side of}} her." [...] She did show loyalty and respect to a number of the staff. In particular, she came to the public defense of a maid who was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle ammunition to Paraguay, providing an affidavit to the maid's good character (even though it was politically inopportune to do so {{at the time of the}} Iran–Contra affair); charges were subsequently dropped, and the maid returned to work at the White House.|$|E
500|$|Making {{their first}} {{appearances}} in The Next Generation in [...] "The Child" [...] were Diana Muldaur as Doctor Katherine Pulaski, and Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan. Muldaur had previously appeared in episodes of The Original Series as other characters, {{and had been}} written in to replace Gates McFadden. Officially McFadden had chosen to leave as she didn't like her character development, the same reason given for Crosby departing during the first season. However, she had actually been fired by Hurley. It had been intended for Pulaski to bring more of a Doctor Leonard McCoy vibe to the series. Meanwhile, Academy Award winner Goldberg had been actively pursuing a role on the show as Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura in The Original Series had inspired her to become an actress. Her agent was initially ignored by the producers as {{they did not believe}} that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the show, until Goldberg called them herself. Her character, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E

500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Lafourcade {{launched}} a promotional tour throughout Mexico and only performed at theaters {{that were at}} least 100 years old. The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few years ago. When I was 13 years old, I ran away from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|R

Sonic Youth mentioned SST often in interviews and in music writer Michael Azerrad's estimation, [...] "seemed to be actively campaigning to get signed to the indie powerhouse"; in turn, Sonic Youth was instrumental in getting SST to sign Dinosaur Jr. Gerard Cosloy, owner of Dinosaur Jr's previous label Homestead Records, said, [...] "SST was the label everyone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> [...] Everyone's favorite bands were on the label; SST was funnier and cooler and it also had the machinery." ...|$|E

O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was being overly flattering and that asserting he was happy as a writer.
