With a simple spray of leaves and a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the {{impression}} that he has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place them. All good design depends on the texture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to. One of the first things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish, and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paint them on dinner plates or dishes. Let them take canvas or paper for such work, but not clay or china. They are merely painting the wrong subjects on the <b>wrong</b> <b>material,</b> that is all. They have not been taught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own. The design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design which you should work on a flat table- cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design. One does not want to eat one's terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor one's clams off a harrowing sunset. Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be {{on the walls of the}} rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.|$|E

40|$|Accurate multi-material mesh {{generation}} {{is necessary for}} many applications, e. g. image-guided surgery, in which precision is important. For this application, {{it is necessary to}} enhance conventional algorithms with physiological information that adds accuracy to the results. There are several approaches working on the generation of such meshes. However, state of the art approaches show inaccuracies in the areas in which thin structures are, e. g. liver vasculature. These algorithms are not able to detect the vessels in areas in which they are narrow and they assign their elements to <b>wrong</b> <b>materials,</b> e. g., parenchyma. We propose to extend two state of the art algorithms, namely that by Boltcheva et al. and that by Pons et al. and enhance them making use of the skeleton of these structures to solve this problem. By analyzing the mesh generated by the aforementioned algorithms one can find several intersections between the mesh belonging to the vessels and the skeleton, show ing that some elements must be mismatched. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in 23 clinical datasets of the liver, in which we previously segmented parenchyma and vessels. For quantitative evaluation, the meshes generated with and without skeleton information are compared. The improvements are shown by means of intersection number, volume and length differences of the vasculature mesh using the different methods. The results show an improvement of 65 % for the number of intersections, 4 % for the volume and 22 % for the length...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{acoustic}} insulation of building façades is often caused by poor mounting conditions and poor final set-up of openable windows. For the first, when <b>wrong</b> <b>materials</b> {{are used to}} obturate {{the gap between the}} window and the construction, the subsequent decrease in {{acoustic insulation}} can be observed in a wider range of frequencies. A poor final set-up of the window will usually lead to whistle noises inside the rooms, especially next to busy roads. Consequently, the aims of this investigation are to evaluate different methods to detect acoustical failures in openable windows, and to present an efficient approach to optimise the sound insulation of a façade. By means of experimental measurements in the acoustic laboratory on a standard openable window, two different and complimentary approaches are compared to evaluate its acoustical quality and failures. More specifically, the first is based on the standard sound insulation measurement according to EN ISO 140 - 3, and the second consists of ultrasonic measurements. The experimental results demonstrate that the standard sound insulation measurements enables to evaluate the quantitative impact of different parameters governing acoustical failures, {{such as the use of}} the correct gasket, continuity and correct amount of pressure applied on the gasket. In addition, it was observed that the ultrasonic measurements enable a quick qualitative assessment that is very efficient to determine the exact position of the acoustic leaks in the façade. Finally, a combined use of standard and ultrasonic measurements is proposed to deliver an efficient approach to detect acoustical failures of a façade. The ultrasonic approach is a quick and cost-effective way to instantly track deficiencies of a window on site, whereas the standard measurement in the laboratory is more time consuming but needed to guarantee the performance of a building element. status: publishe...|$|R
