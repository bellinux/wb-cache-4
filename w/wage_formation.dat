5000|$|The first area—stemming {{from his}} 1980 Oxford doctorate—was {{how to write}} down {{mathematical}} models of trade union behaviour. In the late 1970s, such research was unconventional. However, along with the important 1981 paper by McDonald and Solow in the American Economic Review, Oswald's work was to become standard in modern textbooks. It included a 1982 paper, in The Economic Journal, {{which was the first}} to propose the idea of the ‘utilitarian’ trade union model. Later in the 1980s, he worked on theoretical aspects of labour contracts, with papers in the 1986 American Economic Review and the 1984 Quarterly Journal of Economics. A 1993 paper in Labour Economics argued that last-in-first-out layoff rules means that union indifference curves are locally horizontal. Then began a strand of empirical work on labour markets—particularly the then-unconventional book The Wage Curve [...] (with David G. ("Danny") Blanchflower), published by MIT Press in 1994. This documented the discovery of a power law—with an exponent of approximately -0.1 -- linking wages to the local unemployment rate. Unusually for that era, it used data on 5 million randomly sampled workers around the world; this book went on to win Princeton’s Lester Prize. Replications of the wage-curve finding have been found in a large number of nations. His other research on <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> demonstrated the importance of rent-sharing in the labour market (Quarterly Journal of Economics 1992, Quarterly Journal of Economics 1996); it included it an Oxford University Press book co-authored with Alan Carruth. The fourth strand of work was on entrepreneurship. This led in particular to a 1998 paper, with Danny Blanchflower, in the Journal of Labor Economics with the title [...] "What makes an entrepreneur?". [...] This has become a principal reference in university and business-school courses. It is the most-cited paper of all time in JOLE. (source: Thomson Reuters Web of Science Database, 2013) Other work was on the idea that high rates of home ownership lead to a high rate of unemployment (in the 1997 Journal of Economic Perspectives) and that oil price shocks are a key driver of movements in unemployment (in the 1998 Review of Economics and Statistics).|$|E
40|$|Economic {{theories}} of imperfectly competitive labour markets predict that wages {{are linked to}} profits. In spite of this, profit variables are not explicitly specified in empirical models of <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> that otherwise are appealing.

What is the optimal production mode in terms of strategic outsourcing. We find that if firms will decide on profit sharing before the <b>wage</b> <b>formation,</b> higher outsourcing decreases wage whereas profit sharing has an ambiguous effect. Under flexible profit sharing wage is higher if optimal profit share is small enough. For equilibrium unemployment, we find that if there is no profit sharing in other industries, outsourcing will decrease the unemployment rate.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the costs}} and benefits of a fiscal reform designed to simultaneously increase environmental quality and employment. The investigation is carried out using an econometric general equilibrium model in which the labour market is unionised and segmented, i. e. in which demand, supply and the <b>wages</b> <b>formation</b> process for skilled and unskilled workers are explicitly modelled. This allows us to simulate the implementation in European countries of a harmonised carbon tax whose fiscal revenue in each country is re-cycled to reduce the gross wages of unskilled workers only rather than those of the whole labour force. This paper describes first the theoretical features of the segmented labour market which have been developed and then shows the estimates of the labour market equations. The effects of the double-dividend policy reform previously described are analysed and then compared with those of the traditional and simpler environmental fiscal reform in which the fiscal revenue is used to reduce the gross wages of all workers. We will show that (i) the "green" fiscal reform is more effective, in terms of employment gains, when the fiscal revenue is used to reduce gross wages of all employed workers as a mild substitutability relationship among skilled and unskilled workers is identified, (ii) the employment dividend increases when the tax reform is carried out in a co-operative way i. e. equalising through international co-operation its marginal benefits and costs among countries, (iii) if an "employment double dividend" is feasible in the short-run, a trade-off employment/environment remains in the longer term...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to show {{theoretically}} and empirically how firms' production technology affects the choice of their preferred <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> regime. Our theoretical framework predicts, first, that the larger the total factor productivity of a firm, {{the more likely it is}} to opt for centralized <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> where it can hide behind less productive firms. Second, the larger a firm's scale elasticity, the higher its incentive to choose centralized rather than decentralized wage setting due to labor cost and straitjacket effects. As firms in Germany are allowed to choose their <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> regime, we test these two hypotheses with representative establishment data for West Germany.

40|$|The author holds a PhD in {{economics}} and {{works at the}} Riksbank's Forecast Division. The development of wages in an economy {{can have an impact}} on infla-tion and as it is the objective of the Riksbank to keep inflation at a low and stable level we have to regularly analyse and produce forecasts for wage development. Historically, wages and prices in Sweden have covaried fairly well. However, instability in price and <b>wage</b> <b>formation,</b> for example in the form of upward or downward price-wage spirals, can occur in an economy for various reasons. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a greater understanding of how instability in price and <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> can arise, but also of how the Swedish wage-formation model works. The article analyses wage for-mation in Sweden from the historical, institutional and international perspectives. It also presents an econometric model for <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> that makes it possible to analyse how a number of factors affect <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> in the Swedish economy. This model shows that the situation on the labour market and the collective agreements between the central employee and employer organisations are of great significance for <b>wage</b> <b>formation</b> in the short term. Why do central banks produce forecasts of wage development? Safeguarding price stability is an overall objective for most central banks today. The main tool that the central banks use to keep inflation low and stable is the policy rate. As the interest rate decisions affect inflation with a certain time lag, the central banks must base their decisions on forecasts of future inflation and the factors that may affect it. One such factor may be wage development in the economy. Many central banks thus attempt to forecast the development of wages. Wage development can, however, be measured in different ways and the measure or measures used var...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the state of the local labour market {{influences}} pay, by estimating a Wage Curve for France. First it appears that individual wages are negatively correlated with regional unemployment rates, when taking into account individual characteristics. This feature is true for all categories of workers, for different measures of the local unemployment rate, and also for aggregate data. We find an elasticity of wages with respect to unemployment varying between 0. 05 and 0. 1, and show that permanent effects of the local unemployment on wages rate are stronger than transitory effects. Second we run estimations on cross section and find that the response of wages to unemployment has decreased over time. We try more flexible functional forms for the unemployment rate and it appears that the negative relationship between wages and unemployment is convex rather than linear. Finally, we do not find much autoregression in our wage equation (like Blanchflower and Oswald, 1994). It would mean that the levels and not the variations of wages are related to unemployment, contrary to a Phillips Curve specification. <b>Wage</b> Curve, <b>formation</b> des salaires, taux de chômage régional...|$|R

Investigating four different DSGE models with the Bayesian calibration approach, this paper observes that, especially in a new Keynesian monetary business cycle model with both staggered price and <b>wage,</b> habit <b>formation</b> fails to mimic the shape of output growth in the frequency domain: it counterfactually emphasizes low frequency fluctuations in output growth, compared to the U.
