25|$|In November 2005, it was {{announced}} that veteran driver Sterling Marlin <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> from Chip Ganassi Racing to drive for MB2 in 2006. The team would be sponsored by Waste Management in 12 races, with Centrix Financial returning and Ginn Resorts coming on to fill the remainder of the schedule. In tribute to Marlin's father Coo Coo who had passed the previous year, the team took on the number 14. Midway through the season, the team replaced crew chief Doug Randolph with Scott Eggleston, who worked with Marlin at Team SABCO. The team had only one top 10 finish and ranked 34th in points {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Laue {{was called}} to the University of Berlin as ordinarius {{professor}} of theoretical physics, a position he held until 1943, when he was declared emeritus, with his consent and one year before the mandatory retirement age. At the university in 1919, other notables were Walther Nernst, Fritz Haber, and James Franck. Laue, {{as one of the}} organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically sat in the front row with Nernst and Einstein, who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, where he was the director. Among Laue’s notable students at the university were Leó Szilárd, Fritz London, Max Kohler, and Erna Weber. In 1921, he published the second volume of his book on relativity.|$|E
25|$|On March 2, 1789, the Lower Muscogee chief town of Coweta {{hosted a}} council between their {{division}} of the Muscogee Confederacy and the Cherokee. As town headman, John Galphin, half-blood son of former Indian Commissioner for the United States George Galphin, presided. Dragging Canoe and Hanging Maw led the Cherokee delegation. The representative of the two nations present agreed they trusted neither the Americans nor the Spanish and drafted {{a letter to the}} government of Great Britain pledging their loyalty in return for the king's direct assistance. They promised that if this happened, then the Mohawk, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over.</b> Nothing ever came of the petition, but the council is notable for this as well as for where it took place.|$|E

25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said I <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E

If I went out for lunch or a coffee, there was always someone who <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and say, 'We'd love you to stay'. I'm just glad that, in the end, nothing came of it [...] because it wasn't {{something}} I ever asked for." ...|$|E
500|$|Actual filming {{took place}} over an eleven-week period with {{location}} shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges [...] "was when he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> {{at the beginning of}} each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot." [...] Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on [...] She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997 while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{played the}} golf course at Pinehurst No. 2 for six solid months, and I got to know Mr. Donald Ross...(who) had built the Fort Bragg golf course. He <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and watch us play golf, {{and most of the}} time the captain and colonel hauled me over there. They didn't know who Mr. Ross was, but the other fellow walking with him was JC Penney, and they all knew him." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, the Liberals had {{intentionally}} scheduled {{the mandatory}} [...] "opposition days" [...] (where a specified opposition party controls the agenda) on November 15 (Conservative), November 17 (Bloc Québécois) and November 24 (NDP). These days meant that any election <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> the Christmas season, an unpopular idea. Following {{negotiations between the}} opposition parties, they instead issued an ultimatum to the Prime Minister to call an election immediately after the Christmas holidays or face an immediate non-confidence vote which would prompt a holiday-spanning campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 interview, Cheung's eldest sister, Ophelia, stated Cheung was {{diagnosed}} with clinical depression caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. She said that reporters were frequently found outside of her brother's home which hampered his ability {{to get to his}} doctor's facility. Thus, he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to her house to consult with his doctor. He would ask his sister, [...] "Why am I depressed? I have money and so many people love me." [...] He was reluctant to take medication for his depression.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 April 2010 (National Record Store Day), the new Rolling Stones single [...] "Plundered My Soul" [...] came out, {{featuring}} recently recorded vocals and guitars by Jagger and Taylor. The {{producers of}} the Stones in Exile DVD had asked Taylor for an interview, to which he agreed. One day before this was to take place, Jagger forwarded an e-mail to Taylor's representative in Holland saying he was hoping that Taylor <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to a private studio in the afternoon {{to work on a}} track that was meant to be included on the expanded Exile on Main Street reissue.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Akiva {{said that}} the Israelites {{advanced}} to enter the Reed Sea, but they turned backwards, fearing that the waters <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> them. The tribe of Judah sanctified God's Name and entered the sea first, as [...] says, [...] "Judah became his sanctuary (in order to sanctify God), Israel his dominion." [...] The Egyptians wanted to follow the Israelites, but they turned back, fearing that the waters would return over them. God appeared before them like a man riding {{on the back of}} a mare, as it is said in Song of Songs [...] "To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots." [...] Pharaoh's horse saw the mare of God, and it neighed and ran into the sea after it.|$|E
2500|$|Wanrong's {{younger brother}} Rong Qi remembered how Puyi and Wanrong, both teenagers, loved to race their {{bicycles}} through the Forbidden City, forcing eunuchs {{to get out}} of the way, and told Behr in an interview: [...] "There was a lot of laughter, she and Puyi seemed to get on well, they were like kids together." [...] In 1986, Behr interviewed one of Puyi's two surviving eunuchs, an 85year-old man who proved reluctant to answer the questions asked of him, but finally stated about Puyi's relationship with Wanrong: [...] "The Emperor <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to the nuptial apartments once every three months and spend the night there ... He leave early in the morning on the following day and for the rest of that day he would invariably be in a very filthy temper indeed." [...] Reginald Johnston arranged for the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun, a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family, to visit Puyi in the Forbidden City in September1924, which was the first time the heirs of both the deposed Ming and Qing dynasties came face to face.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Whitney {{told her}} {{visitors}} {{what she had}} determined upon. As Lewes was only four miles off, the schoolmaster {{said that he and}} his wife <b>would</b> sometimes <b>come</b> <b>over</b> to see her; and that he hoped that Reuben, whatever trade he was apprenticed to, would still go on with his studies. He would give him any advice or assistance in his power.|$|R
50|$|There {{were very}} few {{teachers}} in the town, because teachers were still to be imported from the mainland. There {{was no such thing}} as principal, district supervisor, division superintendent because the administration of the school was solely the teacher’s responsibility. During examination time the governor who was the over-all head of the province <b>would</b> just <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and gave oral examination to the pupils.|$|R
50|$|Boys <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{from all}} <b>over</b> the United States {{to attend the}} camp. In later years there was a week set aside for girl choirsters as well. In {{addition}} to the singing the boys spent time canoeing, fishing, swimming and hiking.|$|R
2500|$|Joseph Bailly is {{the subject}} of two {{published}} semi-fictional biographies. [...] The Story of a French Homestead in the Old Northwest, by his granddaughter Frances Howe (1907), is a wildly inaccurate and romanticized version of the family story. [...] Howe, who was partially raised on the Bailly homestead, was an extremely pious and probably racist woman who wrote devotional literature for the Catholic Diocese of South Bend. [...] Her book reads in part like a religious tract. [...] Howe, who {{has been described as a}} [...] "swarthy" [...] Indian and a middle-aged spinster, reportedly acted superior to her immigrant neighbors living next to the homestead and gradually became a recluse. [...] (It is told that children from the neighboring Chellberg farm <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>over</b> and peek in the window and make faces at her, calling her an old Indian.) [...] In order to be accepted into society in turn-of-the-century Indiana, Howe was prepossessed with making her family seem [...] "white" [...] and properly Catholic, and seems to have written the book in order to give the family acceptable genealogical and moral credentials.|$|E

60|$|He expounded at length, with firstlies and secondlies and all minor subdivisions of argument, on organization, and order, and civilization. He {{contended that}} the trader was the bearer of civilization, and that the trader must be {{protected}} in his trade else he <b>would</b> not <b>come.</b> <b>Over</b> to the westward were islands which would not protect the traders. What was the result? The traders <b>would</b> not <b>come,</b> and the people were like wild animals. They wore no clothes, no silk shirts (here he peered and blinked significantly at the king), and they ate one another.|$|R
60|$|However deeply {{engrossed in}} mementoes of the Dark or Stone Ages he might be, he {{never failed to}} see us the moment we entered his echoing gallery. He would lift his eyebrows; his monocle would drop out; and he <b>would</b> <b>come</b> sauntering <b>over</b> to meet us, looking as fresh as apples cold with dew. I liked Captain Valentine. So much so that I sent an almost rapturous {{description}} of him to Mr Anon.|$|R

2500|$|Over 120 men {{and women}} <b>would</b> <b>come</b> forward <b>over</b> {{the course of the}} next 70 years {{claiming}} they were [...] "the lone survivor" [...] of Custer's Last Stand.

50|$|Although the LDS Church has {{no record}} of Tāwhiao being baptized, other Māori joined the church based on a prophecy they claimed Tāwhiao made in the 1860s—that {{messengers}} of God <b>would</b> <b>come</b> from <b>over</b> the Sea of Kiwa (the Pacific Ocean), traveling in pairs and teaching the Māori people in their own language. When some who heard Tāwhiao's prophecy observed pairs of Mormon missionaries from the United States teaching in Māori language, they immediately accepted Mormonism.|$|R
