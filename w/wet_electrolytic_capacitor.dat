25|$|The {{main feature}} of modern non-solid (<b>wet)</b> {{tantalum}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are their energy density {{compared with that}} of solid tantalum and <b>wet</b> aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> within the same temperature range. Due to their self-healing properties (the non-solid electrolyte can deliver oxygen to form new oxide layer in weak areas of the dielectric), the dielectric thickness can be formed with much lower safety margins and consequently with much thinner dielectric than for solid types, resulting in a higher CV value per volume unit. Additionally, wet tantalum capacitors are able to operate at voltages in excess of 100V up to 630V, have a relatively low ESR, and have the lowest leakage current of all <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Capacitors may {{experience}} changes to electrical parameters due to environmental influences like soldering, mechanical stress factors (vibration, shock) and humidity. The greatest stress factor is soldering. The {{heat of the}} solder bath, especially for SMD capacitors, can cause ceramic capacitors to change contact resistance between terminals and electrodes; in film capacitors, the film may shrink, and in <b>wet</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> the electrolyte may boil. A recovery period enables characteristics to stabilize after soldering; some types may require up to 24 hours. Some properties may change irreversibly by a few per cent from soldering.|$|R

25|$|The {{leakage current}} drops {{in the first}} minutes after {{applying}} DC voltage. In this time the dielectric oxide layer can repair all weaknesses by building up new layers in a self-healing process. The time it takes leakage current to drop generally depends {{on the kind of}} electrolyte. Solid electrolytes' leakage current drops much faster than in the case of non-solid types, but it remain at a somewhat higher level. <b>Wet</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> with high water contend electrolytes in the first minutes generally have higher leakage current than those with organic electrolyte, but after several minutes they reach the same level. Although the leakage current of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> is higher compared with the current flow over the insulation resistance at ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> can take several weeks.|$|R
