5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> {{doctors and patients}} at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake was one of those <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted any woman <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E
5|$|After visiting England in July 1936, Thomas Finucane, then {{a company}} director, decided {{to set up}} an office in the West End of London on Regent Street. In November 1936, the family moved to England {{permanently}} and bought a house at 26 Castle Gate Road, Richmond in the London suburbs. Brendan was sent to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School. Brendan completed his schooling with good qualifications. He started in an office job as an accountant which he loathed. In 1937, the RAF began offering short-service commissions (SSC) to lower-class persons <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> academic standard. It offered a four-year term as a junior rank on squadron service with flying lessons. A further six years would be spent on the reserve list. In November 1937, Brendan approached his father about joining the British Armed Forces. Despite his Republican past, the senior Finucane agreed believing a military career would provide him a sense of direction lacking in his own youth. His parents cashed in their insurance policies, even though they needed the money and Thomas Andrew Finucane had been made unemployed.|$|E
5|$|On October1, President George W. Bush {{declared}} Puerto Rico {{major disaster}} area. The declaration allowed federal assistance to reach affected {{communities in the}} United States Commonwealth. Residents <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> requirements to receive federal aid were eligible for funding for temporary housing. People who lost their jobs due to the flooding were eligible for unemployment grants for 26 weeks starting {{the day of the}} disaster declaration. Residents were able to receive up to $200,000 for home damages; up to $40,000 in personal possession losses; and up to $2million for business losses. By October17, more than $5.6million in disaster aid was approved for 20,284 residences. Community Relations teams visited about 7,000 people. Out of the 4,140 small-business loans applications, only 288 were submitted by this time. By October25, the amount of funds nearly doubled, reaching $11million. At this time, more than, 24,500 residents applied for disaster loans. Survey teams checked over 18,000 homes for flood-related damages at this time also. Funding reached $16.5million by November7, with 29,000 people requesting federal assistance. By December5, funding for 37,000 residents reached $23.1million. At this time, the deadline for federal assistance requests was set for January15, 2009. On January2, 2009, funding for small businesses was being provided, with $6million being contributed. Grants for residents also reached $25million. After the flooded rivers crested and receded, bulldozers began clearing mud covered streets.|$|E

5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi at a major international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps, {{which had}} been {{drastically}} reduced in size after World War II, was unprepared {{at the outset of}} the Korean War on 25 June 1950. The Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the Marine Corps to ready a 15,000-man division for duty in Korea as a part of the United Nations Command being created there. The Marine Corps began rebuilding the 1st Marine Division to wartime strength, but in the meantime assembled a 4,725-man force around the 5th Marine Regiment to assist in the war effort as quickly as possible. On 7 July the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was reactivated in California. One week later it sailed from Long Beach and San Diego. The regiment, which had originally been slated for landing in Japan, bypassed that country and landed at Pusan in South Korea on 3 August. As it sailed to Korea, it was put under the command of Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> brigade in-country. The brigade was supported by Marine Aircraft Group 33, and became a subordinate unit of the Eighth United States Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker, who placed it in his reserve.|$|E
5|$|Two Tanzanian swimmers, {{one male}} and one female, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Hilal Hemed Hilal received a universality place, designated for nations with no athletes <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> qualification standards, {{to compete in the}} men's 50 m freestyle. Hilal took up competitive swimming in 2009 and {{was a member of the}} Taliss Swim Club. He had competed previously in the 50 m freestyle and the 50 m butterfly at the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, as well as the 50 m freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke at the Commonwealth Games. He had also won a bronze medal at the 2016 African Swimming Confederation Zone 4 Championships in the 50 m butterfly. In Rio, Hilal was placed in heat four and won it in a national record-setting time of 23.70, which was nearly a second ahead of his nearest competitor, Farhan Farhan of Bahrain. His time, however, was still too slow to qualify him for the semi-finals, as he was 49th overall and thus not among the top 16 overall finishers who advanced.|$|E

25|$|Dan Patch retired undefeated in 1909 as {{the holder}} of nine world records, and {{spent much of}} his later life {{attending}} exhibitions. Even during his racing career, he was used for stallion duty with a stud fee of between $300 and $500, though he was never exposed to the best mares. He had a moderately successful stud career but never sired a horse close to his ability. He sired 38 trotters <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> 2m:30s standard with 1 breaking 2:10. He also sired 138 pacers <b>who</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> standard, 5 of whom broke the 2:05 barrier. Dazzle Patch was his most successful son but died young and left only a few foals behind. Dan Patch's name is rare in modern pedigrees. His most famous descendant is Hall of Famer Jate Lobell, who traces to Dan Patch's daughter Theda Patch in the female line.|$|E
