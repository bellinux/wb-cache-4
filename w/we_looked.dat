5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at war machines, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E

At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E

In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics."

500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at, and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors intercutting footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, Sleater-Kinney {{wanted to work}} with {{producer}} Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo's critically acclaimed 1997album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson, who had recorded every previous Sleater-Kinney album. As Tucker explained, [...] "These songs warranted a different production, so <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> to other people". The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways, stating that it was important for them not to make the same record twice. According to Tucker, [...] "We have to keep pushing in order to stay interested in making music together, we want to have longevity as a band". Similarly, drummer Janet Weiss stated that they [...] "wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out, to make each song have a real strong personality". The album was written {{over the course of a}} year, which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album. It was recorded at Avast! Recording Company in Seattle, Washington in July 1998.|$|E
