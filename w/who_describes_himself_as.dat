5|$|One {{year after}} {{the events of the}} first Ninja Gaiden game, in the Realm of Darkness, Ashtar, the evil lord who {{controlled}} Jaquio, is informed of Jaquio's defeat; he devises a plan to rule over Earth by opening the Gate of Darkness. A U.S. Army Special Intelligence unit member named Robert T. Sturgeon is sent to find Ryu to take out Ashtar. Robert informs Ryu that Irene Lew has been captured and that he must go to the Tower of Lahja to save her. After hopping on a freight train and then battling up the mountain in which the tower lies, he is ambushed by a figure <b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a tribesman of the World of Chaos, led by the Emperor of Darkness Ashtar. After making {{it to the top of}} the tower, Ryu finds Irene, who has been captured by Ashtar. Ashtar then blasts Ryu with energy from his own sword; before Ashtar can finish off Ryu, Robert appears and shoots Ashtar in the back, stopping him. Robert orders Ashtar to hand over his sword and give up, but Ashtar escapes with Irene, telling Ryu to follow him into the Maze of Darkness.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 Marcel Proust read a {{translation}} of Ruskin's chapter The Lamp of Memory in a Belgian magazine. He projected the transforming experience onto the narrator of Du côté de chez Swann, <b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a boy reading the piece in the garden at Combray. Later Proust, who translated some works of Ruskin, claimed to know The Seven Lamps of Architecture by heart.|$|E
25|$|Montague however, {{seems to}} {{represent}} two different people {{at different times}} in the play; i.e. the character himself changes identities during the play. Initially he seems to represent Salisbury, Warwick's father (Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury – a major character in 2 Henry VI) and subsequently, he seems to represent Salisbury's son and Warwick's brother, John Neville (1st Marquis of Montague – a new character). In 3 Henry VI, at 1.1.14, 1.1.117–118 and 1.2.60, Montague refers to York as his 'brother'. Similarly, at 1.2.4, 1.2.36 and 1.2.55, York refers to Montague as his 'brother'. If Montague here represents Salisbury, their reference to one another as 'brother' makes sense, as Salisbury was York's brother-in-law (York was married to Salisbury's sister, Cecily Neville). However, if Montague here represents John Neville, his and York's references to one another as 'brother' are inaccurate. Subsequently, at 2.1.168, Warwick refers to Montague as brother, and he is also called Marquis for the first time, neither descriptions {{of which could be}} applied to Salisbury or to any character <b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a brother to York. As such, in 1.1 and 1.2, Montague seems to be York's brother-in-law, and Warwick's father, Richard Neville (i.e. Salisbury), but from that point forward, after his re-introduction in Act 2, he seems to represent Salisbury's son and Warwick's younger brother, John Neville. Salisbury is a major character in 2 Henry VI, as he is in both Hall and Holinshed's chronicles, and in reality, as outlined in the chronicles, he was killed at Pontefract in 1461 having been captured by Margaret at the Battle of Wakefield (depicted in 1.3 and 1.4).|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{heads down}} to Florida {{to meet with}} Robert California at the Sabre {{headquarters}} to discuss a possible manager position. While sitting in the waiting room, Dwight talks to Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), <b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "toilet of the company" [...] who flushes all the unwanted items away. Robert then tells Dwight that he cannot meet with him but will have him meet with Bill, another executive, much to Dwight's frustration. However, Robert manipulates the situation by secretly calling Gabe and instructing him to not let Dwight speak with Bill either, but to have Gabe listen to Dwight's pitch and then reject him. Dwight, after being told by Gabe {{that he is not}} wanted as a manager, grabs and twists Gabe's arm and forces him to be taken to Robert's Florida condo. Initially, Robert tries to spare Dwight's feelings, but eventually turns him down by telling him he is a better salesman and his drive and energy would be wasted in a manager's position. Dwight then returns to Scranton.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} Cosima and her lab assistant Scott {{playing the}} board game Runewars. Fawcett, <b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a massive board game fan", contacted the game's creators at Fantasy Flight Games {{for permission to}} use Runewars in the show and employed {{one of his friends}} as a consultant for the episode. As a consultant, his friend set up the board for the scene, taught the involved actors how to play the game, checked for accuracy of the gameplay and dialogue about the game, and had a non-speaking cameo appearance in the scene as one of the board game players. Manson chose to incorporate H. G. Wells' science fiction novel The Island of Doctor Moreau, which Ethan Duncan reads to Kira, into the episode since he felt that the novel's themes [...] "run so deep in our show". The book cover featured in the episode was designed by the show's art department.

2500|$|Prentiss is a {{man without}} morals, whose only {{objectives}} are money and power.

McCabe (<b>who</b> <b>describes</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a first class mind") does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss's ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections.
