I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because {{the lack of a}} video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone."

2500|$|Studies have {{indicated}} {{that children who are}} inactive have poor health, but they also have poor cognitive health also. With low fitness there is a relationship to decreased cognitive functioning; for instance there are different types of cognitive problems like perception, memory, cognitive control, and there is lower academic achievement. Many tests have been conducted to identify <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reduction when children do not have physical activity. One test selected children to be in two different groups, one group was physically active the other group was not. After a while of monitoring the children the researchers tested the children in learning and recall memory to see what they were retaining and to observe the difference if available of low physical activity versus high physical activity. The results came back indicating that the children without physical activity have a later recall process than the children with physical activity. The learning part of the experiment was equally distributed on both spectrums for each group, but recall memory was the only variable that did not match both of the groups.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason this}} is {{plausible}} {{is that there}} are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make [...] "predictions" [...] about the parameters. But second, [...] "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into explanations by assuming that {{there is more than one}} universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the multiverse ("world ensemble" [...] was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: [...] "why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another?" ...|$|E

60|$|In order, therefore, {{to arrive}} at what really is {{sensation}} in an occurrence which, at first sight, seems to contain nothing else, we have to pare away all that is due to habit or expectation or interpretation. This {{is a matter for}} the psychologist, and by no means an easy matter. For our purposes, it is not important to determine <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sensational core in any case; it is only important to notice that there certainly is a sensational core, since habit, expectation and interpretation are diversely aroused on diverse occasions, and the diversity is clearly due to differences in what is presented to the senses. When you open your newspaper in the morning, the actual sensations of seeing the print form a very minute part of what goes on in you, but they are the starting-point of all the rest, and it is through them that the newspaper is a means of information or mis-information. Thus, although {{it may be difficult to}} determine what exactly is sensation in any given experience, it is clear that there is sensation, unless, like Leibniz, we deny all action of the outer world upon us.|$|E
60|$|We {{meet with}} this {{limitation}} {{of the idea of}} progress in every member of the school to which, more than to any other, Turgot belonged. Even in the vindication of the claims of Christianity to the gratitude of mankind, he had forborne from laying stress on any original contribution, supposed to be made by that religion to the precious stock of ethical ideas. He dwells upon the 'tender zeal for the progress of truth that the Christian religion inspired,' and recounts the various circumstances in which it spread and promoted the social and political conditions most favourable to intellectual or scientific activity. Whatever may be the truth or the value of Christianity as a dogmatic system, {{there can be little doubt}} that its weight as a historic force is to be looked for, not so much in the encouragement it gave to science and learning, in respect of which Western Europe probably owes more to Mahometanism, as in the high and generous types of character which it inspired. A man of rare moral depth, warmth, or delicacy, may be a more important element in the advance of civilisation, than the newest and truest deduction from what Turgot calls 'the fundamental principles of the science of morals.' The leading of souls to do what is right and humane, is always more urgent than mere instruction of the intelligence as to <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right and the humane. The saint after all has a place in positive history; but the men of the eighteenth century passionately threw him out from their calendar, as the mere wooden idol of superstition. They eagerly recognised the genius of scientific discovery; but they had no eyes for the genius of moral holiness. Turgot, far as he was from many of the narrownesses of his time, yet did not entirely transcend this, the worst of them all. And because he could not perceive there to be any new growths in moral science, he left out from a front place among the forces that have given strength and ripeness to the human mind, the superior capacity of some men for kindling, by word and example, the glowing love and devout practice of morality in the breasts of many generations of their fellows.|$|E

40|$|Indeed, methodological {{pluralism}} is {{a cornerstone}} of the field. Thumbing through a typical issue of a personality journal will reveal a rich array of methods, including longitudinal and experimental designs; studies of typical and atypical populations; and {{a wide range of}} assessment procedures, including self-report scales, informant reports, projective tests, observational assessment, and DNA analyses. This methodological diversity reflects, and is in fact compelled by, the breadth and complexity of the substantive questions personality researchers seek to address. It is not surprising that a field that aims to understand everything from genetic to cultural influences on the person involves a wide range of methods.
