5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his money to buy a glider. Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade glider to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

25|$|Realizing {{that the}} company <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of {{business}} {{if it did not}} receive a large infusion of cash, Iacocca approached the United States Congress in 1979 and successfully requested a loan guarantee. In order to obtain the guarantee, Chrysler was required to reduce costs and abandon some longstanding projects, such as the turbine engine, which had been ready for consumer production in 1979 after nearly 20 years of development.|$|E
25|$|ANA {{surveyed}} 800 {{passengers who}} flew the 787 from Tokyo to Frankfurt: expectations were surpassed for 90% of passengers; features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure (90% of passengers), cabin ambiance (92% of passengers), higher cabin humidity levels (80% of passengers), headroom (40% of passengers) {{and the larger}} windows (90% of passengers). 25% said they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{of their way to}} again fly on the 787.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2014, SpaceX {{capabilities}} and pricing had {{also begun to}} affect the market for launch of US military payloads. For nearly a decade the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) had faced no competition for military launches. Anticipating a slump in domestic military and spy launches, ULA stated that it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders. To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.|$|E

25|$|Rebbe Nachman {{told his}} disciples {{that as a}} small child, he eschewed the pleasures of this world and {{set his sights on}} spirituality. He paid his melamed (teacher) three extra coins for every page of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to {{encourage}} the teacher to cover more material. From the age of six, he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> at night to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the mikveh afterward.|$|E
25|$|The Zags {{ended the}} regular season at 21–10, their first season with double digits in losses since 1997–98, which was also the last season to date in which they {{failed to make the}} NCAA tournament. It had {{generally}} been thought that Gonzaga would have to win the WCC tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, Gonzaga would go on to win the conference tournament, notably beating a Santa Clara team in the final that had earlier handed the Zags their first home-court loss in nearly four years. They <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{in the first round of}} the NCAA tournament to Indiana.|$|E
25|$|The {{brutality}} was {{aggravated by}} alcohol, particularly at night. Frequent and extreme drunkenness, {{which was a}} common problem within the SA, aggravated the situation at Kemna, as numerous former inmates later testified. Typically, off-duty guards <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready {{to take part in}} interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, normally closed at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open. Veller's drinking was so out of control that he was incapable of showing up for work on a regular basis—and it was no secret.|$|E

25|$|Francia {{took several}} {{precautions}} against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure {{there was no}} poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under his pillow. Even so, a maid tried to poison him {{with a piece of}} cake. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide; all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> at night with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along {{the next morning to}} offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E
25|$|Artillery bombardments {{were to be}} co-ordinated with {{infantry}} attacks, {{with various}} types of artillery given suitable targets for the cumulative destruction of field defences and the killing of German infantry. Heavy artillery and mortars were {{to be used for}} the destruction of field fortifications, howitzers and light mortars for the destruction of trenches, machine-gun and observation posts; heavy guns and mortars to destroy fortified villages and concrete strong points. Longer-range guns were to engage German artillery with counter-battery fire, to deprive German infantry of artillery support during the attack, when French infantry were at their most vulnerable. Wire cutting was to be performed by field artillery, firing high explosive (HE) shells and supported by specialist wire-cutting sections of infantry, which <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> the night before an attack. During the attack, the field artillery would fire a linear barrage on trenches and the edges of woods and villages. Infantry tactics were to be based on reconnaissance, clear objectives, liaison with flanking units and the avoidance of disorganisation within attacking units. General attacks would need to be followed by the systematic capture of remaining defences for jumping-off positions in the next general attack.|$|E

25|$|As the Browns {{beat the}} Bills, the 49ers beat the Yankees in San Francisco by {{a score of}} 17–7. That set up a {{championship}} game matchup between Cleveland and San Francisco in Cleveland. In {{the week before the}} game, AAFC and NFL owners agreed to terms under which the Browns, 49ers and Colts would play in the NFL starting in the 1950, while the AAFC's other clubs <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of business. Owners of disbanded teams got minority stakes in NFL clubs, while a dispersement draft would allocate AAFC players to active teams in the newly organized league to be called the National American Football League. The owners had floated a similar proposal in 1948, but it had been vetoed by George Preston Marshall, the owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins, and Tim Mara, the owner of the New York Giants. Teams in both leagues were suffering financially, {{in part because of the}} competition between them for talent that was driving up player salaries and eating into owners' profits. Paul Brown criticized the deal the owners eventually agreed upon, preferring a unified two-league setup like the one in Major League Baseball.|$|E
25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in the USOC match and by all accounts looked very much as if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a quick exit from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including a dreary 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E

Juicy J <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{with his}} street team to {{cities such as}} Atlanta, and passed out these mixtapes. On June 10, 2013, Juicy J announced he would be releasing a four track mixtape prior to the album titled, Wax. All the songs on the mixtape were reported to also have music videos, however that mixtape would not come to fruition, and [...] "Wax" [...] would {{end up being a}} track on Stay Trippy.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{concerns}} were expressed by other O.T.O. members. The O.T.O.'s US head, Karl Germer, labeled her [...] "an ordeal {{sent by the}} gods". Her disruptive behavior appalled Fred Gwynn, a new O.T.O. member living in the commune at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue: [...] "Betty went to almost fantastical lengths to disrupt the meetings [...] that Jack did get together. If she could not break it up by making social engagements with key personnel she, and her gang, <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to a bar and keep calling in asking for certain {{people to come to}} the telephone." ...|$|E

A passing [...] "charming man" [...] in a luxury car stops to offer the cyclist a lift, and although the protagonist is at first hesitant, after much deliberation he accepts the offer. While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear". The motorist tells the cyclist: [...] "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care".|$|E
