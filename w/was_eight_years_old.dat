5|$|Jordan Nagai as Russell. Throughout {{most of the}} film, {{he makes}} several {{comments}} to Carl that suggest that Russell's father and mother are no longer together. Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part. Nagai, who is Japanese American, showed up to an audition with his brother, who was actually the one auditioning. Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai <b>was</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin. Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar's first casting of an Asian lead character, {{in contrast to the}} common practice of casting non-Asians in Asian parts.|$|E
5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch.

August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he <b>was</b> <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E
