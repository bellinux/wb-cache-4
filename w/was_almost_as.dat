5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E
25|$|That, however, <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> far as Bridge's {{first-class}} cricket career went. He was ill in 1962 {{and could}} play in {{no more than}} six matches, and though there were occasional appearances in games over the next three seasons and a final one in 1968, he bowled fewer than 400 overs {{after the end of the}} 1961 season and took only 33 further wickets.|$|E
25|$|The 1904 club <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> {{good as the}} {{previous}} year's team, but due {{to the emergence of}} the New York Highlanders as a strong contender, the Americans found themselves in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. Foreshadowing what would eventually become a storied rivalry, the 1904 race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.|$|E

25|$|The party still {{failed to}} present a true {{challenge}} to the Liberal government, since its agenda was seen as too extreme for the liking {{of central and eastern}} Canada. A notable exception was rural central Ontario, an area that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> socially conservative as Reform's western heartland. However, due to massive vote splitting with the PCs, this support only translated into one seat in Ontario during its 1993 breakthrough--the only seat that the party ever won east of Manitoba. That seat was lost in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Jewish musical tradition, for instance, was far {{older than}} anyone else's in Europe. Music {{remained}} {{an element in}} Jewish services, and the cantor <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> pivotal a figure in local Jewish society as the rabbi. But Jewish musicians, except as converts, had played no part in European musical development. Hence the entry, in considerable numbers, of Jewish composers and performers on the musical scene in the middle decades {{of the nineteenth century}} was a phenomenon, and a closely observed one.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} {{to win the}} part of Mammy in Gone with the Wind <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> fierce as that for Scarlett O'Hara. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote to film producer David O. Selznick to ask that her own maid, Elizabeth McDuffie, be given the part. McDaniel did not think she would be chosen because she had earned her reputation as a comic actress. One source claimed that Clark Gable recommended that the role be given to McDaniel; in any case, {{she went to her}} audition dressed in an authentic maid's uniform and won the part.|$|E

25|$|The {{most popular}} {{catalysts}} {{are based on}} iron promoted with K2O, CaO, SiO2, and Al2O3. The original Haber–Bosch reaction chambers used osmium as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted uranium <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher Alwin Mittasch discovered a much less expensive iron-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes ruthenium-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl on graphite.|$|E
25|$|Panic and consternation reigned in Charleston at {{the news}} of the fall of the fort. A truce of six months was agreed to during which peace {{attempts}} failed. After a difficult winter for the Cherokee due to the loss of the Lower Towns' harvest and shortage of ammunition for hunting, as well as disease, Cherokee morale still remained high. In a goodwill gesture, the Cherokee allowed Fort Prince George to receive a limited amount of supplies and even though it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable as Fort Loudoun had been the Cherokee did ot put it under close siege.|$|E
25|$|This was an {{incredible}} feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> good as its batting. Their bowling-lineup boasted of some stellar names: Keith Miller, who was a genuine allrounder capable of giving very good performances with both bat and the ball, Ray Lindwall, who was said to possess absolute mastery of bowling in any condition, an who was bowling accurately, with penetrative and attacking bowling, and Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston, who were both equally vital cogs in the team. This particular innings of Hazare's {{was said to have}} enhanced India's reputation as well as his. In the process, Hazare emulated Bradman, who did the same in the previous test.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} matches in the long history of the fixture occurred in the 1870s. The first of these was 'Cobden's Match' in 1870. F. C. Cobden took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year S. E. Butler took 10-38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by five more wickets in the second innings. In 1873 Oxford won by only three wickets. The 1875 match <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> close an affair as that in 1870. Needing 175 to win, Cambridge were 161-7 at one point, but were all out for 168 to lose by six runs.|$|E
25|$|Drummer Mason was {{replaced}} by Mike Clark, and the band released a second album, Thrust, the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two Head Hunters releases was released in 1975 as Flood.) This <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> well received as its predecessor, if not attaining {{the same level of}} commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called Survival of the Fittest in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for Return of the Headhunters, and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 the {{university}} hired John Eckstorm away from Kenyon College (Kenyon had beaten Ohio State 29–0 the previous year). He brought professional coaching {{skills to the}} program and immediately won the Big Six {{for the first time}} by going undefeated, as well as beating Oberlin College after previous teams had gone 0–6. His second season <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> successful, as the 8–1–1 record included a scoreless tie against Michigan. In 1901, however, center John Sigrist, a 27-year-old senior, was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve and the continuation of intercollegiate football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board backed away from a confrontation and let the team decide its future, a faculty resolution to cancel the season was not easily defeated and Eckstorm resigned.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{players with}} {{one year of}} service {{in the minor leagues}} were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues. The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was {{selected}} off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963. He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league system, and made his major-league debut with them on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19. His major-league debut, against the Chicago White Sox, <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> impressive as his minor-league debut, holding the White Sox to one earned run on seven hits. He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenaged pitchers to hit a major-league home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.|$|E
25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks had set {{a target}} of 283 when rain intervened at Sophia Gardens. Having been put in to bat by Glamorgan Dragons' captain Robert Croft, they got {{themselves}} to 155 for 2 thanks to fifties from Usman Afzaal and David Sales, and to finish the innings off Bilal Shafayat and Riki Wessels recorded scores at run rates higher than six an over. Wessels spent 20 deliveries for his unbeaten 43, while Shafayat got a run-a-ball 31. For Glamorgan, Alex Wharf got three wickets, but conceded 71 runs from nine overs, while Andrew Davies <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> expensive with 53 from eight overs, but took four wickets. Glamorgan saw off 33 balls from Northamptonshire in chase of 283 to win, losing Croft for 1 {{as they made their}} way to 22 for 1, but rain then put an end to play and Glamorgan took two points from the game.|$|E
25|$|Planning for the {{offensive}} began in August and continued in September, while XIV Corps (Lieutenant-General the Earl of Cavan) was engaged {{on the right}} flank and XV Corps (Lieutenant-General John Du Cane) and III Corps (Lieutenant-General William Pulteney) were fighting for Delville and High woods, which added to the burden on transport, engineer, pioneer and labour units. Repairs to damage caused by German artillery-fire diverted effort and shelter built for fresh divisions being assembled behind the front, communications improved and new battery positions and headquarters erected, new supply dumps created, water supplies increased and carrying services organised into the ground due to be captured. The Chief Engineer, Major-General R. U. H. Buckland, had labour and engineer stores for road and track building and repair brought forward, in preference {{to work on the}} Fourth Army (General Sir Henry Rawlinson) rear area, which was helped by new railheads at Albert and Fricourt. A broad-gauge line had been pushed up to Maricourt by 10 September and a metre-gauge track <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> far as Montauban.|$|E

25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} , {{not only that}} the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> familiar as the British Constitution. It was known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended from time to time, had played {{in the development of the}} nation, and the harmonious working of its political institutions.|$|E
25|$|During {{its final}} years, the Minardi team <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> {{famous for its}} {{politics}} as its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial shop steward. During his time as team principal, Stoddart campaigned for reduced costs in the sport. He appealed to the competing car manufacturers for an agreement where the independent (and, on the whole, financially weaker) teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals than at present. In return, the team principals who would benefit from this would support the works teams {{when it came to}} opposing new rule changes enforced by the FIA, such as the proposed ban on traction control. Before the start of the 2004 season, however, Stoddard threatened to withdraw his support against the ban on traction control, but later changed his mind. Midway through the 2004 season, the other teams voted to change the unpopular single lap qualifying system back to the old 1 hour format, but Stoddart voted against because it would also mean the 107% rule being reintroduced; this meant the change never occurred, as a unanimous vote was required to change something so significant {{in the middle of a}} season. Before the 2005 Australian Grand Prix Stoddart initially threatened to withdraw his cars if they were made to comply with the revised regulations for 2005. Stoddart claimed that Minardi could not afford to adapt their cars. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Stoddart has also repeatedly called for the resignation of the FIA's President, Max Mosley, particularly in the aftermath of the 2005 United States Grand Prix where the majority of teams withdrew from the race due to safety concerns about their Michelin tyres. While Minardi had run Bridgestone tyres, Stoddart had offered to compromise with the Michelin teams but Mosley had rejected it.|$|E
