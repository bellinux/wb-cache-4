Two songs from those sessions, [...] "Moving Targets" [...] and [...] "Eyes Like Pearls", were included on What Were You Hoping For?. After setting up his own label in 2009, Hunt began a new process for What Were You Hoping For?, writing and recording songs for 10 months. In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Allan Raible of ABC News {{compared}} the song to earlier Radiohead songs [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] and [...] "Pyramid Song" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} compositions Thom Yorke and company have ever released." [...] Richardson gave the song a score of seven out of ten in Pitchforks song review feature The Playlist, and wrote that while it could be criticized as [...] "a noble but failed experiment, overly maudlin and sentimental even if it is surface-level pretty", the song's [...] "simplicity and unsubtle affect, especially coming from this band, <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> strengths." [...] In a later column, Richardson would further defend the song from charges of excessive sentimentality and attributes the song's emotional success to its severe subject, death: [...] "If these pieces were connected to thoughts of breaking up with a girlfriend or getting fired or lamenting cold weather or any of a million other of life's tragedies, they wouldn't work, {{at least not in the}} same way. They need that huge weight [...] on the other end to balance them out." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com called the song a [...] "slow, florid affair" [...] and placed its [...] "typically dark" [...] lyrics in the context of Radiohead's previous political activism, such as their participation in the anti-human trafficking MTV EXIT campaign.|$|E
