The structure cbm-prises a sampled linear filter, called a <b>whitened</b> <b>matched</b> <b>filter,</b> and a recursive nonlinear processor, called the Viterbi algorithm. The outputs of the <b>whitened</b> <b>matched</b> <b>filter,</b> sampled once for each input symbol, are shown to form a set of suillcient statistics for estimation of the input sequence, a fact that makes obvious some earlier results on optimum linear processors. The Viterbi algorithm is easier to implement than earlier optimum nonlinear processors and its performance can be straight-forwardly and accurately estimated. It is shown that performance (by whatever criterion) is effectively as good as could be attained by any receiver structure and in many cases is as good as if intersymbol inter-ference were absent. Finally, a simplified but effectively optimum algorithm suitable for the most popular partial-response schemes is described. G.

30|$|Two {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for MAP sequence detection until now: Forney approach [4] and the Ungerboeck approach [38]. The former uses the output of a <b>whitened</b> <b>match</b> <b>filter</b> for computing the branch metrics of the Viterbi algorithm (VA) leading to a Markovian channel model, while the latter can work directly with the output of a <b>filter</b> <b>matched</b> to the received pulse.

Nevertheless, when the MAP symbol detection strategy is adopted, while the Forney observation model can be directly applied, the extension of the Ungerboeck observation model is not trivial. In [39], this problem is solved and it is proven that both models are also equivalent for MAP symbol detection. Based on the keen observation made in [39], a BP detection algorithm based on the Ungerboeck approach [40] was proposed for dispersive channels providing impressive complexity reduction comparing with [33]. Similar low-complexity FGs have been derived for channels with memory in [32]. Recently, a novel BP detector employing the Ungerboeck observation model has been presented [34] for ICI channels which shows a good performance-complexity trade-off at low Doppler frequencies.|$|R

40|$|A new {{combined}} precoding/shaping {{technique for}} fast digital transmission is proposed. Major advantages of this "dynamics shaping" are: Dynamics {{of the signal}} at the input of the decision device are reduced by a great amount. Thereby, A/Dconversion, adaptive equalization, and symbol timing are rather facilitated. A trade-off between signal dynamics at the transmitter output, decision device input and the SNR-gain by noise whitening is offered. For dynamics limitation relevant in practice, gains up to 6 dB are achieved. Nevertheless, system complexity is lower than in other precoding/shaping techniques.

40|$|Abstract — To {{digitize}} the ultra-wideband (UWB) signal at its Nyquist rate, {{a frequency}} channelized receiver for UWB radio based on hybrid filter banks (HFB) is presented. Among {{the challenges of}} such receivers are the uncertainties of the analog analysis filters and the slow convergence speed. To overcome these problems, a channelized receiver operating at slightly above the critically sampling rate is presented. The proposed receiver, which is designed for use in transmitted reference (TR) systems, combines the synthesis <b>filters</b> and the <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> so that the joint response of the analysis filter and the propagation channel can be estimated independently in each subband. When the input noise is colored or a narrowband interference (NBI) is present, the weighting in each subband can be adaptively adjusted so to approximate the noise <b>whitening</b> and <b>matched</b> <b>filtering</b> operation for near optimal detection. The adaptive performance of the proposed receiver is slightly better than an ideal full-band receiver when the input noise is white and significantly better when a NBI is present. The effect of the automatic gain controller (AGC) and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) are also considered. The proposed receiver with 3 -bit ADC seems sufficient to achieve performance comparable to an infinite bit channelized receiver even {{in the presence of}} large NBI.

40|$|The wide {{spread of}} mobile smart phones and {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for more}} throughput by the users has put a sever burden on cellular networks. Limited bandwidth availability and crowded base station deployments of the cellular system pushes network operators to improve existing network efficiency. This means reducing inter-cell interference such that each base station can maximize performance. In goal of this dissertation is to investigate techniques that mitigate inter-cell interference for modern cellular systems and focuses on development of practical scheduling algorithms for inter-cell interference coordination {{that can be applied}} to currently deployed LTE Release 8 networks and development of more advanced inter-cell interference mitigation techniques based on coordinated beamforming. One of the classical methods of mitigating inter-cell interference is inter-cell interference coordination. Not only does it help improve cellular data coverage but also allow more efficient use of valuable wireless spectrum. This dissertation investigates soft frequency reuse for LTE systems. Systems employing soft frequency reuse is analyzed and it is found that classification of cell-edge users and cell-center users is critical. To improve performance, de-centralized scheduling algorithms that include optimal user classification and balances throughput and fairness among users is proposed. Additional sub-optimal methods to reduce the computational complexity is introduced. Simulation demonstrates that gains of the 5 th percentile user throughput can be increased without loss to the overall cell average throughput compared to a non-cooperating system. Next, coordinated beamforming which require faster and tighter coordination among base stations is investigated. Multi-user and multi-stream coordinated beamforming based on maximization of the harmonic-sum of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is proposed. Simulation results show that it improves cell-edge users compared with prior researched coordinated beamforming algorithms based on minimizing mean square error, maximizing uplink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and maximizing weighted sum-rate. Additionally, proposed coordinated beamforming is further extended to multi-carrier systems with per-antenna power constraints. Low complexity algorithm that can be applied to coordinated beamforming algorithms with <b>whitened</b> <b>match</b> <b>filter</b> structure is proposed and simulated. The key idea is to update a common antenna power regulating diagonal matrix, which determines the antenna power of a precoding matrix in each iteration. The algorithm can be scaled to any number of subcarriers because it only updates a common diagonal matrix for all subcarrier. Simulations show that proposed algorithm enables excellent antenna power efficiency with low number of iterations and converges quickly. Furthermore, it can significantly mitigate inter-cell interference and improve performance over non-coordinating system. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|The space-time <b>whitened</b> <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> (ST-WMF) maximum {{likelihood}} sequence detection (MLSD) architecture has been recently proposed (Maggio et al., 2014). Its objective is reducing implementation complexity in transmissions over nonlinear dispersive channels.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a summary and nine included papers, grouped into three parts. There is one journal paper, three reports written {{in the style of}} articles, four conference papers and one paper submitted to a conference. The thesis proposes and investigates a number of digital receivers, especially receivers based on the maximum a posteriori and maximum likelihood criteria. Signal processing methods and models are developed and applied to a number of estimation and detection problems in systems with time dispersion and additive Gaussian noise. Digital receivers in two application areas are investigated: telecommunications and ultrasonic distance measurements. Within telecommunications, particular attention is given to block transmission systems, where digital data is transmitted in independent blocks. With a geometric approach and reflecting on properties of the binary hypercube, it is shown that the minimum bit-error probability receiver (OBER) becomes the maximum likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) when the expected SNR used for designing the OBER goes to infinity. Likewise, the OBER reduces to the <b>whitened</b> <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> with hard decisions in the limit when the expected SNR decreases. Furthermore, a novel detector is developed that makes MLSD-decisions on scattered bits in a block. This low-complexity detector can, if combined with a sub-optimal receiver such as a linear or decision- feedback equalizer, substantially reduce the system bit-error rate. Finally, using the geometric approach, the genie-aided detector, a device proposed by Forney for deriving performance bounds, is reconsidered and augmented with an explicit statistical description of the side information. This renders a more flexible tool, new performance bounds, and gives an instructive view on earlier work. Reduced complexity Viterbi detection is addressed by means of combined linearViterbi equalizers. These equalizers reduce the complexity of the Viterbi detector, a structure for implementing the MLSD, by linear pre-equalization of received data and by giving the Viterbi detector a truncated channel model. Three receivers in this class are introduced, one of which is intended for multiple-antenna reception in block transmission systems. In the field of ultrasonics, the problem of estimating the time-of-flight of an ultrasonic pulse is addressed under the assumption that the pulse has been distorted by an unknown, linear and time-dispersive system and by additive Gaussian noise. Two approaches for taking the linear distortion into account are presented. Both assume that the transmitted pulse is known and narrowband. Although the intended application is distance estimation using the ultrasonic pulse-echo method, the assumed basis of the time-of-flight estimation problem is more general: a known narrowband waveform is transmitted through a dispersive, linear system with additive Gaussian noise.

Recently,[20] proposed a developed NMF (D-NMF) to improve the performance of NMF.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This thesis {{discusses}} {{the design of}} an approximate <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> capable of detecting a 30 MHz, 0. 45 microsecond pulsed carrier in white noise. The theoretical background, which the <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> is based upon, is presented. The <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> described herein is composed of an open-end lumped-parameter delay line and a narrow-bandpass amplifier. Passive signal generation is employed by using {{the fact that the}} impulse response of a circuit is the inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response of the circuit. In this experiment, therefore, two identical circuits are used; one is for signal generation while the other is for the <b>matched</b> <b>filter.</b> The signal is not reproduced at the output of the <b>matched</b> <b>filter,</b> but the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized. The <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> circuitry is compact and is economical to build. There are a few limitations which affect the response of the designed circuit, but they are not those that cannot be solved...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{noise reduction}} using <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> and wavelet transform in the signals of continuous wave radar and pulse radar. The denoising application of wavelets {{has been used}} in spectrum cleaning of atmospheric radar signals. <b>Matched</b> <b>filter</b> has a strong anti-noise ability; it can also achieve accurate pulse compression in a very noisy environment. This paper analyzes the algorithms of <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> and wavelets that are used in radar signal processing to reduce the noise. The simulation results indicate that <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> has a strong anti-noise ability for pulse radar and wavelet for continuous wave radar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a novel <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> for CDMA system. The {{structure of the}} proposed matched fil-ter mainly consists of two parts: a voltage follower with a sample hold circuit and a selector which changes the pseudo-noise sequence (PN sequence) pattern. From the results of SPICE simulation, {{it is found that}} the proposed <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> operates at the chiprate of 5 MHz and over. In addition, we found that the power consumption of the proposed <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> is 47. 3 mW at 5 V power supply. The proposed <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> has been realized in a 1. 2 µm CMOS process. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper extends {{previous}} works in <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> bounds [2][3][4] {{and provides a}} theoretical calculation of detection probability of q-ary QAM signals averaged over the diversity reception and multipath fading ISI channels. The <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> bounds are the best attainable detection performance at a given SNR, {{which may or may}} not be obtainable in practice. While an exact analytical expression of detection performance associated with a practical transceiver over multipath ISI channels is difficult to obtain, the <b>matched</b> <b>filter</b> bounds provide many useful information to be compared with the simulation results.
