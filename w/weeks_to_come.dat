5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans. The competitors were given three <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E
25|$|The volcano erupted on January 3, 2010, {{forcing the}} {{evacuation}} of 8,000 people. This is the 10th such eruption of the volcano in the past year, and the first of 2010. Colombian authorities also stated that it could remain volatile in the <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

25|$|In April 1973, the Architect of the Capitol {{awarded the}} {{architectural}} design contract to John Carl Warnecke, a nationally prominent architect {{working in the}} District of Columbia who had helped save Lafayette Square and designed the John F. Kennedy grave site. Warnecke's design for the building {{was approved by the}} Senate Committee on Public Works on August 8, 1974. Warnecke was given just two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the cost estimate, which the Architect of the Capitol later claimed was far too little time to generate an accurate cost forecast. By the end of the year, the estimated cost of construction had risen to $69 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of the spectacle of shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
500|$|Hester {{returned}} his first touchdown of the season, a 73-yard punt return, against the Kansas City Chiefs during Week 2. He nearly recorded a second touchdown return, but {{the play was}} negated by a holding penalty. Hester {{established himself as a}} threat on offense, when he caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Brian Griese against the Minnesota Vikings. He also returned a punt for an 89-yard touchdown, though the Bears lost the game. In the <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> many opposing special teams began to kick the ball away from Hester, contributing to, according to Mike Pereira, a 132% increase in kickoffs that went out-of-bounds. Rod Marinelli, the head coach of the Detroit Lions, placed a strong emphasis on kicking the ball away from Hester, saying, [...] "kick the ball into Lake Michigan and make sure it (sinks) to the bottom." ...|$|E

The government has converted Bahrain into a military base trying to isolate the villages to prevent people from reaching protest sites," [...] he added. Ali Salman of Al Wefaq praised Tamarod protests, saying they scored more success than expected by drawing media attention and maintaining peacefulness. He also expressed his relief about the small number of casualties and the lack of deaths. Human Rights First (HRF) criticized the government of Bahrain response to protests, which they said reflected the [...] "increasing levels of frustration felt by many in Bahrain at the lack of any real reform". [...] "What happened today confirmed fears that the government of Bahrain is determined to crush any form of dissent," [...] said Brian J. Dooley of HRF.|$|E

The Rock kept possession of the title belt until , when Austin defeated him to retain the title and get his title belt back. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid in his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the title against The Rock the next night on Raw Is War.

2500|$|The {{album is}} {{split into two}} halves: the first half is mostly {{electronic}} dance punk, while the second half features Vaudevillian piano, strings, and accordion. The band grew tired of writing only with drum machines and keyboards and, inspired by film scores (specifically the works of Danny Elfman and Jon Brion) decided to write a completely different half. [...] "By the end of that, we were completely exhausted," [...] said Ross of the studio sessions. After its completion, [...] "we had two <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home {{and learn how to}} be a band," [...] Ross said.
