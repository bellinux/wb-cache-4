30|$|Introduction: The use of {{antibiotics}} is a major public health, economic and ecological challenge. In 2011, a French national <b>warning</b> <b>plan</b> was created to manage the use {{of antibiotics}}. It advocates monitoring of the prescription of antibiotics and the implementation of measures to assess professional practices. The great majority of guidelines concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired peritonitis are based on studies with low level of evidence. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the implementation of a Standardized Operational Report (SOR) with a local antibiotic protocol in the management of community-acquired peritonitis at our institution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this study, we used {{hydrological}} alteration diagnosis {{system to}} acquire the flood variation form and degree of Xuanen County under changing environments, and analyzed its cause mechanisms using the formula of Chézy-manning. The results showed that: firstly, the annual maximum daily flow series from 1962 - 2013 jumped a downward moderate variation in 1999, which indicated that the dual influence of human activities leaded to the variation of the annual maximum daily flow. Secondly, river canalization has started in 2005 and completed in 2012, which has reduced the flood discharge at equal water level, aggravating the flood variation to a certain extent. Finaly, human activities have great influence on the flood control abilities of urban water bodies of Xuanen. Xuanen County river canalization resulted in decrease of the flood flow, exacerbating the variation of flood, thereby the flood <b>warning</b> <b>plan</b> needed {{to adapt to the}} changing environment, which would make river flood prevention decision more scientific and feasible...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{study of}} the catastrophic {{collapse}} of a dam is of interest {{because of the risk}} to life and property the ensuing flooding may cause. During this century there have been more than 200 failures of dams greater than 15 metres high[1]. They have caused {{millions of dollars worth of}} damage and a loss of more than 8, 000 lives. These recent disasters have focussed attention on means for assessing public safety and predicting probable damage from the collapse of a dam. Many water authorities are required to assess the risk of failure and develop a flood <b>warning</b> <b>plan</b> for all of their large dams. However, this is not the case for the smaller water supply reservoir which form part of the water reticulation system in many cities. These reservoirs are typically 50 metres in diameter and 10 metres high and contain approximately 20 mega litres of water. They are usually located in elevated positions in residential areas. Due to their proximity to residential areas, water supply...|$|E

Key insights are provided as to how satellite telecommunications, remote sensing, navigation systems, GIS, and the emerging domain of social media are utilized in the context of emergency management needs and requirements. These systems are now critical in addressing major man-made and natural disasters. International policy and treaties are covered along with various case studies from around the world. These case studies indicate vital lessons that have been learned about how to use space systems more effectively in addressing the so-called “Disaster Cycle. ” This book is appropriate for practicing emergency managers, Emergency Management (EM) courses, as well as for those involved in various space applications and developing new satellite technologies...|$|R
30|$|Our study {{indicated}} that rainfall trend and variability directly reflected the pattern of rangeland WRSI in eastern Ethiopia. Moreover, the future rainfall trend analysis indicated {{that there would be}} rainfall variability in the years 2020 – 2049, 2040 – 2069, and 2070 – 2099, and this rainfall variability is expected to limit the future rangeland water index in our study areas. Based on our study, it can be concluded that the historical rainfall variability data was important determinant of rangeland WRSI values and {{can be used as a}} reference point for decision-making tools beforehand to reduce the impact of rainfall variability on livelihoods of pastoral communities. Therefore, we suggested using our findings as an early <b>warning</b> <b>planning</b> to minimize potential livestock feed insecurity, and the severity of drought condition. Accordingly, conservation of rangelands, use of appropriate grazing management, capacity building on rangeland management systems, and enhancing rangeland productivity through enclosure management should be practiced to reduce atmospheric CO 2 and sustain rangeland productivity under the changing climate in the eastern part of Ethiopia.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: With climate change, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwave events. In response to the devastating mortality and morbidity of recent heatwave events, many countries have introduced heatwave early warning systems (HEWS). HEWS are designed to reduce the avoidable human health consequences of heatwaves through timely notification of prevention measures to vulnerable populations. Objective: To identify the key characteristics of HEWS in European countries to help inform modification of current, and development of, new systems and plans. Methods: We searched the internet to identify HEWS policy or government documents for 33 European countries and requested information from relevant organizations. We translated the HEWS documents and extracted details on the trigger indicators, thresholds for action, notification strategies, message intermediaries, communication and dissemination strategies, prevention strategies recommended and specified target audiences. Findings and Conclusions: Twelve European countries have HEWS. Although there are many similarities among the HEWS, there also are differences in key characteristics that could inform improvements in heatwave early <b>warning</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a fully-integrated, medium-performance, fixed-base driving simulator for testing and evaluating crash avoidance warning systems. Three major aspects of the ongoing effort are described: our motivation for constructing the simulator, the system architecture, and the crash avoidance warning systems. The paper concludes with an assessment of our progress to date. The physical simulator is a modified automobile cab instrumented to provide driver activity information and in-vehicle warnings that accurately reflect the performance of proposed sensors during defined scenarios. The simulation computing architecture uses a distributed multi-CPU environment to support six out-the-window displays, a head-up and a head-down display, six channels of audio output, and software to control the simulation and produce <b>warnings.</b> <b>Planned</b> evaluation with a population of subjects in a variety of scenarios will determine the best warning systems for use in prototype vehicles. We describe the hardware and software in place to provide visual, multi-channel audio, and haptic warnings corresponding to the simulated environment and scenario. We also describe a typical scenario and the process leading to manifestation of warnings of an impending collision...|$|R

2500|$|An {{earthquake}} [...] is {{the result}} of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. [...] At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by vibration, shaking, and sometimes displacement of the ground. Earthquakes are caused by slippage within geological faults. The underground point of origin of the earthquake is called the seismic focus. The point directly above the focus on the surface is called the epicenter. Earthquakes by themselves rarely kill people or wildlife. It is usually the secondary events that they trigger such as building collapse, fires, tsunamis (seismic sea waves) and volcanoes. Many of these could possibly be avoided by better construction, safety systems, early <b>warning</b> and <b>planning.</b>|$|R
