When the directors of the films <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> why he was doing a scene a certain way or delivering a line in a specific manner, Rickman would simply reply that he knew something they didn't.|$|E
25|$|Adamson v. California, â€“ Adamson {{was charged}} with murder but chose not to testify because he knew the {{prosecutor}} <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about his prior criminal record. Adamson argued that because the prosecutor had drawn attention to his refusal to testify, and thus Adamson's freedom against self-incrimination had been violated. Reed wrote that the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend the protections of the Fifth Amendment to state courts. Reed felt that {{the framers of the}} Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to apply the Bill of Rights to states without limitation.|$|E
25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called tapping. On a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk {{through the crowd and}} literally tap a prospective member on the shoulder and then walk with him up to the tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} was completed, Cazares {{announced the}} band signed a North American deal with Century Media Records, and a licensing deal with Roadrunner Records in Europe. His decision to choose Century Media {{was based on}} the creative freedom the label gave him, whereas Roadrunner <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to produce radio and commercial songs when he was in Fear Factory. However, Yeung claims Roadrunner were not interested and said {{he did not want to}} be on a label that is [...] "sort of interested".|$|E
500|$|Wheeler {{questioned}} how he {{got hooked}} up with Easton; Joseph answered that he was recommended by a former road manager. He was included in a try-out with four others, rehearsed with the band, they then cut it down to two, and rehearsed with Sheena for the final cut. Joseph anticipated they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to do a solo {{on at least one}} of the songs he was asked to play during the audition, so he wrote a solo for all three songs, which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream a Little Dream of Me" [...] delves {{into the}} backstory of hunter Bobby Singer. The writers always knew his history would be [...] "grounded in family". Reflecting this, the {{original}} teaser depicted the supernatural deaths of Bobby's children; while eating dinner with his family, his children's throats are supernaturally slit, and they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Why, daddy, {{why did you}} let this happen?" [...] However, the writers could not determine where to go from there. Following Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically possessed wife.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{was also}} {{involved}} in other reform movements. He urged better conditions for factory workings, opposed capital punishment, and supported the temperance movement. His friend Longfellow was especially concerned about his fanaticism for temperance, worrying that Lowell <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to destroy his wine cellar. There are many references to Lowell's drinking during his college years, and part of his reputation in school was based on it. His friend Edward Everett Hale denied these allegations. Lowell considered joining the [...] "Anti-Wine" [...] club at Harvard, and he became a teetotaler {{during the early years}} of his first marriage. However, as he gained notoriety, he became popular in social circles and clubs and he drank rather heavily when away from his wife. When he drank, he had wild mood swings, ranging from euphoria to frenzy.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{really had}} {{no option but to}} agree to do it, despite my {{reservations}} about working in television. Coming so quickly after my decision to stay on the radio, this was quite an irony. I was given one day of training... from one minute to zero, at which point you have to say goodbye. I did not find that easy at all... I made a real hash of it after one of the early games..... very kindly, suggested a plan... as soon as the count started in our earpieces I <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> a question, and he would talk until the count reached eight seconds to go. I would then thank him, turn to the camera and tell the audience briefly about the next game to be televised. Miraculously, {{for the rest of the}} tournament I always heard 'zero' in my ear at the moment I said goodbye... the whole experience served to confirm my belief that my decision to stick with Test Match Special was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Cold as Ice" [...] {{is based on}} a {{relationship}} Cox had with a girl named Alice. Having fallen in love with her in the fifth grade, he proposed to marry her on the school's playground. Alice rejected Cox, calling the ring he had given her [...] "a cheap piece of crap." [...] Years later, Cox worked with Alice at a Subway restaurant. Occasionally, [...] "for no reason", she <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to watch her change into her uniform in the restaurant's refrigerator, which he described as having been as [...] "cold as ice". Cox suspects that [...] "she was trying to torture me or something." [...] The song [...] "Bite Marks" [...] is about [...] "sadomasochism and boy prostitution." [...] In the song, Cox references an experience he had when he was kissing a man who bit him [...] "really, really hard" [...] on his shoulder, leaving bite marks [...] "for like two weeks." [...] This experience, along with other abuses he received as a child, formed the lyrical basis of the song.|$|E

500|$|Thorson {{said that}} the game started to come {{together}} about six months into its development. He tested the game on close friends once every few weeks and they <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> when they could play it again. Thorson brought the game to the 2013 Evolution Championship Series fighting games tournament, where he unexpectedly received more praise than criticism. The game mechanics were inspired by games from Thorson's youth. Upon reflection, {{he felt that the}} game had the item-catching mechanics of Super Smash Bros., the one-hit kills and tension of Bushido Blade, the playfulness of Goldeneye 007, the shooting mechanics of , and the positioning strategy of Team Fortress 2. He described his development process as tweaking Super Smash Bros. Melee to his tastes. The limited arrow design was intended to slow the gameplay and encourage player strategy. He considered adding online multiplayer, a popular request, but lacked the programming skills himself. The game's medieval scenery came from his contemporary interest in the Game of Thrones book series and his pairing of the arrow mechanic with [...] "stone-walled castles and lava-filled dungeons". The player-characters also have individual personalities and backstories that Thorson intended to elaborate in a [...] "lore" [...] section of an instruction manual.|$|E
500|$|The {{witty and}} playful side of CreangÄƒ's personality, which became notorious {{during his time}} at Junimea and {{constituted}} {{a significant part of}} his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow Junimists in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself [...] "for against" [...] during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle {{and the two of them}} on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for money: [...] "not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday and last week and last week and throughout life". His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber's report contended, CreangÄƒ's writing relied on him being [...] "a strong sensual and auditive type", and a [...] "very emotional" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working on}} the WENR farm report, Jim Jordan heard a true story about a shopkeeper from Missouri whose store was brimming with stock, yet he claimed to be [...] "smack out" [...] of {{whatever}} a customer <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for.

Noah's contemporaries replied that if a flood did come, it would come only on Noah's father's house.

2500|$|DeLay {{was known}} to [...] "primary" [...] Republicans who {{resisted}} his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, {{like many of his}} predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the [...] members of the party. Employing a method known as [...] "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips {{from both sides of the}} aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza's {{break with}} the {{prevailing}} dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, {{it appears to have}} been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: [...] "If anyone thinks my criticism [...] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E
