In an interview {{after the release of}} their fourth album, Suffa revealed that The Calling was recorded on his mother's computer and the simplicity of their 'studio' is the reason <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the music on the album is in monaural ('mono') sound.|$|E

The Department of Justice (DOJ) directed Adams and Coates not to comply with the subpoena, stating that the authority to initiate criminal prosecution of anyone lies with the DOJ, not with the Civil Rights Commission.|$|E

25|$|Pride and Prejudice {{has also}} {{inspired}} works of scientific writing. In 2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine darcin, after Mr. Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In 2016, a scientific paper {{published in the}} Journal of Inherited Metabolic Diseases speculated that Mrs. Bennet {{may have been a}} carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't have any sons, and <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Bennet sisters are so silly.|$|E
25|$|The Farm Maps {{also make}} clear {{why so many}} {{property}} owners were distraught about {{the coming of the}} grid, and <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work. The maps are replete with houses that are directly in the way of where streets were scheduled to run, and lots that would be bisected, trisected, or completely obliterated by the streets and avenues of the new grid. No wonder people fought back against the Commissioners' Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most {{probable}} interpretation {{is that the}} Mugharrarin reached the Sargasso Sea, {{a part of the}} ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda yet one thousand miles away from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the Mugharrarin presumably met some Guanche tribe. This would explain <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) and why they were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.|$|E

500|$|In August 2009, Milian {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled {{to be released in}} 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying [...] "we just got our label deals done, so the reason <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she was going back into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, {{and that it would be}} the first single off Elope. Reported choices for the first single include [...] "Zipper", [...] "I'm a Cheat", and [...] "Supersonic".|$|E

[...] And feeling, without {{which there is no}} poetry, has no need of gesticulation. [...] …..This restraint in the displaying of emotions retains their vehemence, and indeed doubles their intensity. [...] But for ears that hear not, harmonies such as these are almost confused with silence.

2500|$|Three {{investigations}} into the Fukushima disaster showed the man-made nature of the catastrophe and its roots in regulatory capture associated with a [...] "network of corruption, collusion, and nepotism." [...] Regulatory capture refers to the [...] "situation where regulators charged with promoting the public interest defer to the wishes and advance {{the agenda of the}} industry or sector they ostensibly regulate." [...] Those with a vested interest in specific policy or regulatory outcomes lobby regulators and influence their choices and actions. Regulatory capture explains <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the risks of operating nuclear power reactors in Japan were systematically downplayed and mismanaged so as to compromise operational safety.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually Aslan shows himself {{directly}} to the travelers, addressing their fears or their self-pity, or their condescension towards others, or their pomposity (after Shasta and Aravis ask <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the events happened, he said [...] "I tell no one's story but their own"). After the victory over the Calormenes, Aslan reveals himself to Rabadash {{in an effort to}} free him of his arrogant and violent ways. When kind words and forgiveness fail to soften Rabadash, who calls Aslan the [...] "demon of Narnia", Aslan resorts to an act of severe kindness: he turns Rabadash into a donkey. To cure himself of this [...] "condition", Rabadash must present himself at the temple of the Calormene god Tash in Tashbaan, where in the sight of his people he would be restored to human form. But if he thereafter goes without ten miles of the temple, he would be turned back into a donkey permanently. Since then, Rabadash remained in Tashban where he ruled until his death.|$|E
2500|$|A {{garbage bag}} {{was used to}} suffocate her, as it was found around her head. She had also been {{physically}} abused and raped. Creek had been bitten on the neck and was beaten and slashed in the facial area. The bite had caused compression to her neck, which {{played a role in}} her death. The word [...] "hi" [...] was written on the girl's palm, which was raised in an upward position. A price tag from a bookstore was observed to have been present on one of her arms. She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her pants pocket. A possible explanation to <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger {{responded that}} [...] "we didn’t write more {{because the only}} {{abortion}} story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s {{not so much a}} conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage". Explaining <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, [...] "One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD." [...] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story [...] "upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss".|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theory of}} hybrid vigor {{suggests}} {{that as a}} group, dogs of varied ancestry will be healthier than their purebred counterparts. In purebred dogs, intentionally breeding dogs of very similar appearance over several generations produces animals that carry {{many of the same}} alleles, some of which are detrimental. If the founding population for the breed was small, then the genetic diversity of that particular breed may be small for quite some time. In essence, when humans select certain dogs for new breeds, they artificially isolate that group of genes and cause more copies of that gene to be made than might have otherwise occurred in nature. Initially, the population will be more fragile {{because of the lack of}} genetic diversity. If the dog breed is popular, and the line continues, over hundreds of years diversity will increase due to mutations and occasional out-breeding; like an island with a few new birds—they will diversify. This is <b>why</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the very [...] "old" [...] breeds are more stable. The problem is when certain traits found in the breed standard are associated with genetic disorders. Then, the artificial selective force favors the duplication of the genetic disorder, because it comes with a desired physical trait. The genetic health of hybrids tends to be higher. Healthy traits have been lost in many purebred dogs lines because many breeders of showdogs are more interested in conformation – the physical attributes of the dogs in relation to the breed standard – than in the health and working temperament for which the dog was originally bred.|$|E
