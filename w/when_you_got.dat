500|$|However, Looking Glass Studios {{experienced}} serious {{financial trouble}} as development progressed into mid-1997. The company's Austin branch closed, costing Spector and several game engine programmers; this team relocated to ION Storm, and released Deus Ex in 2000. Spector later called his impact on Thief, [...] "at best, minimal". Levine too had left The Dark Project project before the Keepers factions {{was added to}} the game. By April 18, Looking Glass Studios laid off half of its entire staff in six months, which damaged morale of The Dark Project team, which at this point was vastly different from the one with which the development began. [...] "Few emotions can compare to the stress of heading to work not knowing who might be laid off, including yourself, or whether the doors would be locked <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there," [...] lead programmer Tom Leonard later said. This stress caused several team members to voluntarily quit, including the lead programmer (Briscoe Rogers) who had designed the game's AI system, which suffered from software bugs and problems with complexity.|$|E
500|$|In March 2005, Radiohead {{began writing}} and {{recording}} new music in their Oxfordshire studio. In {{an effort to}} [...] "get out of the comfort zone", they decided against involving producer Nigel Godrich, with whom they had recorded five albums. At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed {{a version of the}} future In Rainbows track [...] "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" [...] with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with the band updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, [...] The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, [...] "we spent {{a long time in the}} studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating." [...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working [...] "because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good." [...] They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer.|$|E
500|$|The track {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to {{the style of}} 808s & Heartbreak, a studio album by rapper Kanye West noted for its jarring use of auto-tune. West has often been noted as an influence by Ocean. Ology writer Terron R. Moore mused that unlike West, Ocean was [...] "an inherently sad guy" [...] and that feeling of inner loss and hopelessness appears on every track on the album, even when he's supposed to be singing about the [...] "Sweet Life". He noted a hidden sense of despair on the song, not immediately apparent on first listen. The song also contains parallels to Ocean's own musical career, where Ocean recognizes that an album is much like a relationship: [...] "the main track, the single, often {{is not the best}} choice." [...] While singles are generally regarded as an album's best song, Ocean remarks that sometimes the most obvious decision holds more subtly. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard mused that Ocean took on the role of a [...] "captain" [...] on the track, prodding the privileged to reach for more by unraveling their lavish realities; [...] "Why see the world, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> the beach?" [...] he asks rhetorically. Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail stated that the track depicts dislocated lives of easy pleasure, of [...] "keepin’ it surreal" [...] with pills and sunshine, in music that’s supposedly all about feeling good.|$|E

2500|$|His {{successor}} at the Marinepersonalamt , described Lütjens as {{a dedicated}} naval officer who put his {{service to the}} nation ahead of the ruling party. He also described him as a difficult man to know. Austere, rather forbidding, he said little and when he did, confined his remarks to the essentials. Patzig said of him [...] "one of the ablest officers in the service, very logical and shrewd, incorruptible in his opinions and an engaging personality <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to know him." [...] Few did. Lütjens's dedication to his officer principles meant he did not marry until he was 40—adhering to a code that an officer should wed only when he could support a wife.|$|E

2500|$|Leykis denied {{allegations}} that the call {{was part of a}} hoax set up by the show, and producers turned over all information they had about the caller to police who began an investigation. Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program. [...] Geraldo: [...] "So what was your first reaction <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> this call?" [...] Leykis: [...] "I was shocked. You know, people call talk shows and say all kinds of things, but they never confess to murder." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] {{and talking about the}} nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has since}} been {{critical}} of Obama's handling of the United States' military role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On April 16, 2011, she said Obama [...] "willfully ignored {{the will of the}} American people... <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." [...] She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama [...] "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." [...] She continued, [...] "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent." ...|$|E
