25|$|According to American {{fundamentalist}} Protestant author Hal Lindsey, the Third Temple {{could be}} built {{right next to the}} Dome of the Rock. He believes, based on the theory of Dr. Asher Kaufman regarding the location of the Eastern Gate, that the Dome of the Rock was built on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> refers to as the Court of the Gentiles. He states that according to Revelation 11:1–2, the rebuilding of the Third Temple was not to include the section of the temple mount known as The Court of the Gentiles. Therefore, he believes that the Third Temple and the Dome of the Rock could stand side by side.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{inspiration}} is {{the doctrine}} in Christian theology {{concerned with the}} divine origin of the Bible and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> teaches about itself. Different groups understand the meaning and details of inspiration in different ways. Most such as Evangelicals and Catholics, see the Bible as a truly human product whose creation was superintended by the Holy Spirit, preserving the authors' works from error without eliminating their specific concerns, situation, or style. This divine involvement, they say, allowed the biblical writer to reveal God's own message to the immediate recipients of the writings and {{to those who would}} come later, communicating God's message without corrupting it.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of the Bible and slavery {{in the era of}} the Civil War was never a simple question. The issue involved the American expression of a Reformed literal hermeneutic, the failure of hermeneutical alternatives to gain cultural authority, and the exercise of deeply entrenched intuitive racism, as well as the presence of Scripture as an authoritative religious book and slavery as an inherited social-economic relationship. The North– forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create– lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to determine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragedy of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> is to Christianity and the Quran is to Islam, {{but like}} all major ancient Indian religions, there is no {{consensus}} among the different Buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism. The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. This corpus includes the ancient Sutras organized into Nikayas, itself the part of three basket of texts called the Tripitakas. Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 texts – all claimed to have been spoken by the Buddha – and another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition. The Buddhist textual history has been vast; over 40,000 manuscripts mostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhist, were discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> said was the most important thing to be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E

In August 2009, Gene Robinson was a key speaker at the 2009 Greenbelt Festival, held at Cheltenham Racecourse, Gloucestershire, England. Here he delivered three talks, each garnering an attendance in the thousands, based not only on his views of Christianity and homosexuality, but also on human sexuality in general and the rights of LGBT members of society. The three talks were entitled [...] "Homosexuality: <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> says & why it matters", [...] "Keeping your cool in the eye of the storm" [...] and [...] "Sexuality and spirituality: keeping them together". [...] As well as these three talks, Gene Robinson made a big impact on some gay and lesbian festival-goers by leading them collectively in prayer on the second night of the festival as part of a small group.|$|E

2500|$|According to perennialist author Frithjof Schuon, {{the message}} of the Sermon is a perfect {{synthesis}} of the whole Christian tradition. The text has the largest number of perennial and universal doctrines, and spiritual advice of all Scripture. Much of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> readers remembers from it derives from the Sermon. Source of spiritual and moral instructions, the Sermon on the Mount is regarded by the Perennial Philosophy [...] "as the quintessence itself of religion".

2500|$|At {{six years}} old, Piper was {{converted}} to faith in Christ at his mother's knee while {{on vacation in}} Florida. He remarks that it [...] "blows him away" [...] that he was saved at six years old, not because he remembers the event, but because the Bible tells him what happened to him. When he shared his testimony on his website, desiringgod.org, he said that it's very dangerous to rely on one's memory or experience when pondering when God saved them. He states this is the case, because both are fallible and can be misleading. Thus, he wants to encourage others like himself who can't remember the exact date of their conversion, by pointing them to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> says.|$|E
