25|$|Nowadays {{bandages}} {{of synthetic}} materials are often used, often knitted fiberglass bandages impregnated <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane,</b> sometimes bandages of thermoplastic. These are lighter and dry {{much faster than}} plaster bandages. However, plaster can be more easily moulded to make a snug and therefore more comfortable fit. In addition, plaster is much smoother and does not snag clothing or abrade the skin.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{original}} Osprey, the Osprey 2 is a mid-wing cantilever monoplane with a flying boat hull {{and a single}} engine mounted pusher-fashion in a nacelle mounted above the fuselage on struts. A passenger seat is provided side-by-side with the pilot and the cabin is fully enclosed. Retractable tricycle undercarriage is provided for land operations, the main units of which fold into the undersides of the wings. Construction throughout is of wood and skinned in plywood. Some of the hull contours are formed <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane</b> foam covered in fiberglass.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it will take to control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane</b> foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E
40|$|In {{many areas}} of {{application}} of conventional non-degradable cross-linked polyurethanes (PUR), {{there is a need}} for their degradation under the influence of specific environmental factors. It is practiced by incorporation of sensitive to degradation compounds (usually of natural origin) into the polyurethane structure, or by mixing them <b>with</b> <b>polyurethanes.</b> Cross-linked <b>polyurethanes</b> (<b>with</b> 10 and 30 %wt amount of synthetic poly([R,S]- 3 -hydroxybutyrate) (R,S-PHB) in soft segments) and their physical blends with poly([d,l]-lactide) (PDLLA) were investigated and then degraded under hydrolytic (phosphate buffer solution) and oxidative (CoCl 2 /H 2 O 2) conditions. The rate of degradation was monitored by changes of samples mass, morphology of surface and their thermal properties. Despite the small weight losses of samples, the changes of thermal properties of polymers and topography of their surface indicated that they were susceptible to gradual degradation under oxidative and hydrolytic conditions. Blends of PDLLA and <b>polyurethane</b> <b>with</b> 30 wt% of R,S-PHB in soft segments and PUR/PDLLA blends absorbed more water and degraded faster than <b>polyurethane</b> <b>with</b> low amount of R,S-PHB...|$|R

500|$|The {{monument}} is {{endangered by}} the climate (which has caused damage by frost and rain) and by air pollution. Although in 1990 {{the area around}} the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument. In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the fastenings of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic. [...] The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens. Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane</b> filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.|$|E
500|$|The topmost block serves also as the {{foundation}} for the [...] high monolithic travertine column, which is [...] by [...] at the base.

The column is topped by a copper figure of Liberty (1), which is [...] tall and {{in the form of a}} woman lifting three gilded stars, symbolizing the constitutional districts of Latvia: Vidzeme, Latgale and Courland. The whole monument is built around a frame of reinforced concrete and was originally fastened together with lead, bronze cables and lime mortar. However, some of the original materials were replaced <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane</b> filler during restoration. There is a room inside the Monument, accessed through a door in its rear side, which contains a staircase leading upwards in the Monument that is used for electrical installation and to provide access to the sewerage. The room cannot be accessed by the public and is used mainly as storage, however it has been proposed that the room could be redesigned forming a small exhibition, which would be used to introduce foreign officials visiting Latvia with the history of the Monument after the flower-laying ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 a 2.0-litre {{model was}} added. Launched at the March Geneva Motor Show, the Alfetta 2000 {{replaced}} the outgoing Alfa Romeo 2000. This range-topping Alfetta was [...] {{longer than the}} others, owing to a redesigned front end with square headlights and to larger bumpers <b>with</b> <b>polyurethane</b> inserts; the rectangular tail light clusters and C-pillar vents were also different. Inside there were a new dashboard, steering wheel and upholstery materials. Just a year later, in July 1978, the two-litre model was updated becoming the Alfetta 2000 L. Engine output rose from 122PS to 130PS (DIN); inside upholstery was changed again and dashboard trim went from brushed aluminium to simulated wood. The Alfetta 2000 was sold as the Alfa Romeo Sport Sedan in the United States, where [...] "Alfetta" [...] {{did not have the}} same cachet as in Europe. The 2000 received fuel injection in 1979.|$|E

The results also showed that SM played a vital role in improving the foam properties, which could be attributed to the participation of the functional groups in SM in the polyurethane foam synthesis.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of the polymers containing nucleic acid bases in backbone or in pendant groups were prepared.
