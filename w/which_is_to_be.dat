5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development fell apart due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back in the pipeline for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, {{the routes}} were redefined. Route 6 {{would be a}} {{completely}} new alignment from Paterson to the George Washington Bridge, and Route 5 would only run east from Route 1 (Broad Avenue, now U.S. Route 1/9) in Ridgefield. The alignment of Route 10 west of Ridgefield was designated Route 10N until it was eventually {{turned over to the}} county. Route 5 retained its routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. By the 2000s, the section of Route 5 along River Road to the former ferry was removed. In June 2007, construction began on a $24.6 million project to improve the route through Palisades Park. This project, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed later in 2009, will involve the replacement of the bridge over Delia Avenue, the removal of a bridge over an abandoned rail line, and the widening of the two-lane road to include a shoulder.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, Felix Schlag was {{announced}} as the winner. His design featured {{the portrayal of}} Jefferson which would be used on the nickel until 2004, closely conforming to the former president's bust by sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. However, the model differs from the nickel that was struck for circulation because it featured a view of Monticello from an angle, and a style of lettering officials did not like; Schlag was required to change both. Either through a misunderstanding or an oversight, Schlag did not include his initials in the design; {{they would not be}} added until 1966. Production began on October 3, 1938; they were released into circulation on November 15. According to contemporary accounts, the Jefferson nickel was initially hoarded, and it was not until 1940 that it was commonly seen in circulation.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as to whether it was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times.|$|E
