They meet Gaston Gray, or GG, a famous American salvager, who tells them {{of the dangers of}} the region, in {{particular}} an enormous great white shark called Thanatos. The trio makes a bet with him to see who finds Valka Castle first. They find several pieces of lapis lazuli, but their progress is slowed down due to the infamous <b>whirpools</b> known as the Ciceros Undines, as well as hostile wildlife in the region. The player finds a lapis lazuli bracelet that tells them to visit at night when the Undines are dormant. The player and Océane travel to a sunken ruin at night and find GG looking for the castle. GG leaves them suddenly, only for Océane to spot the giant shark Thanatos. The player attempts to battle Thanatos, only to find out the Pulsar's electric charges are too weak to tranquilize the shark. In order to escape Thanatos, Océane and the player hide in a well only to discover the lost Valka Castle, now a haven for marine life. They find a centuries-old map made by Anaximander, showing the circular world model. Later, Océane and the player hear a mysterious song, which they surmise to be the Song of Dragons, and are caught in a booby-trap. They manage to free themselves, finding a tablet made of lapis lazuli in a hidden vault. They also spot a North Atlantic right whale outside the castle windows. GG is shocked at the discovery and realizes the treasure he's looking for isn't in Ciceros Strait, so he hastily bids the group farewell.|$|R

40|$|Purpose The paper {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} {{innovation}} and a company’s performance in a business environment. The importance of innovation performance measurement is point out in prelude of this contribution. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present and discus knowledge and findings of secondary and finally also original primary research into South-Moravian companies within two projects of Internal Grant Agency Faculty of Business and Management Brno University of Technology, which were conducted in 2009 and 2010. Methodology/methods For this analysis a questionnaire survey was used – the results of the primary research reflect innovative activities from the managers’ point of view. To evaluate companies’ attitude to innovative activities and their measurement, I choose factors such as conditions for innovative activities, types of innovative activities, their evaluation, responsibility for innovation etc. as seen by managers. Also a case study of well known multinational company <b>Whirpool</b> about their transformation of way how they innovate is included. Scientific aim The aim of the paper is to gain knowledge and analyze the present situation about issue of innovation performance measurement as this topic is solved in the Czech and foreign professional literature and in the Czech business environment. Findings Author proved with help of questionnaire survey that many companies still don’t measure their innovation performance although given the importance of innovation as an engine of growth. Only very few organizations have an effective system for measuring their overall innovation performance. Conclusions It was possible to sum up existing knowledge and approaches to innovation performance measurement by literary search and other relevant information resources. Their accomplishments and disabilities are compared in accordance with local and foreign experts’ theories. Thanks to this, new and simplifier methodology of innovation performance measurement for SME called Innovation Scorecard has been described. This methodology is based on well known system Balanced Scorecard. Unfortunately, implementation of BSC is timely and financially too challenging for our SME. Therefore some basic elements and approaches to performance measurement were used for Innovation Scorecard...|$|E
