25|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> {{started doing}} the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of this enquiry I found that much more had been done than I had been aware of, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> {{published}} the Essay. The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> {{played for}} South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. It is, indeed, obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E

500|$|Cuarón had {{experimented with}} long takes in Great Expectations, Y tu mamá también, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. His style is {{influenced}} by the Swiss film Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, a favorite of Cuarón's. Cuarón reminisces: [...] "I was studying cinema <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> saw , and interested in the French New Wave. Jonah was so unflashy compared to those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically.

For the Glass Swords album cover, Whyte was shown various designer's portfolios by Warp. Whyte chose Jonathan Zawada, as he felt it had a [...] "'70s sci-fi art feel". After discussing ideas with Whyte, Zawada gave him the album cover in a few days. When asked about the album cover resembling two erect penises, Whyte responded [...] "Everyone says that!

500|$|People {{connected}} with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: [...] "I remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." [...] Gary Smith, {{who at the time}} was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he [...] "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." [...] Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production [...] "sounded way better than the other ones." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{reason why}} I {{chose to do}} the {{recording}} in London this time was because I wanted to make an album in a closed-off environment, {{sort of like a}} place where sunlight doesn't reach.

The songs which I've always made often share the same views and ideas as the listener, but this time, they're more like shouts and prayers from my individual innermost self. With this image, I've probably gotten closer to how I was like inside <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> debuted.

500|$|A jazz fusion album, Song of Innocence {{combines}} jazz elements with impressionistic musical {{figures and}} hard rock guitar solos. Its music also incorporates funk, rock, theatre, and pop styles. Music journalists categorized the record as jazz-rock, baroque pop, and psychedelic R. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music {{could be better}} characterized as art pop than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all I did was jazz. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> got in the record business, I was so into jazz that I had never heard Elvis Presley. I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way. Immediately they're going to say I am advising every young girl {{to go out and get}} pregnant. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard the song, I thought it was silly. But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E

In an introductory interview with the Detroit press, Oana {{had this to say}} about his supposed connection to Hawaiian royalty: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>first</b> joined the Seals, stories were published that I was a Hawaiian prince.
