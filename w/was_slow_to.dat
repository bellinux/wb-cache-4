5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|The actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the Lord Chamberlain, and {{requested}} that he settle the dispute, {{but he refused}} to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> respond.|$|E
50|$|The Athenians {{managed to}} survive for several reasons. First, their foes were lacking in initiative. Corinth and Syracuse <b>were</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> bring their fleets into the Aegean, and Sparta's other allies <b>were</b> also <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> furnish troops or ships. The Ionian states that rebelled {{expected}} protection, and many rejoined the Athenian side. The Persians <b>were</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> furnish promised funds and ships, frustrating battle plans.|$|R

5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{photographic}} societies such as Danske Kamera Piktorialister (Danish Camera Pictorialists) in the 1930s, there was increasing pressure from activists such as H.B.J. Cramer to have photography recognized as an art form. Indeed, the movement continued {{right up to the}} 1970s. A counter-movement to pictorialism, the 1920s' Neue Sachlichkeit <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> reach Denmark but surfaced in 1948 when Keld Helmer-Petersen published his abstract colour studies in 122 Colour Photographs.|$|E
5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: {{those on the}} hull were on {{retractable}} supports; those on the superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility by up to 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> mechanize {{compared to}} the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, and only a few mills continue to operate.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ADS) is {{a severe}} {{developmental}} disability characterized by impairments in social interaction and communicative skills. Despite a growing research {{interest in the}} field, the causes of these impairments remain unknown. Two lines of research, Theory of Mind (ToM) and Central Coherence (CC), using experimental tasks such as visuo-spatial perspective Taking (VPT) and the local and global levels have suggested that visuo-spatial attention and spatial variables in the self-versus other recognition, may {{be the basis of}} the cognitive processes underlying social interaction. According to spatial attention, such as observed in the Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) may contribute to explain the differences in the spatial attention and the brain activation of autistic children in these two tasks. Participants with ASD in the CC experiment <b>were</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the global level. In the VPT experiment the participants with ASD <b>were</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> respond to the left hemifield in the interaction first personal perspective (1 PP) and condition Common ground (CG), meanwhile <b>was</b> <b>slower</b> <b>to</b> response to the right hemifield in the interaction Third personal perspective (3 PP) and condition Common Ground (CG).

5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Photography in Denmark has {{developed}} from strong participation {{and interest in}} the very beginnings of the art in 1839 {{to the success of}} a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during {{the last half of the}} 19th century while both artistic and press photographers have made internationally recognized contributions. Although Denmark <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> accept photography as an art form, Danish photographers are now increasingly active, participating in key exhibitions around the world.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> {{bring its}} Vengeances into service, their first combat {{missions}} being flown in June 1943. The main {{deployment of the}} type took place between mid-January and early March 1944, when squadrons operated in support of Australian and United States Army forces in New Guinea. This force was withdrawn after only six weeks as the Vengeance was considered inferior to other aircraft available to the Allied air forces. All of the RAAF's five Vengeance-equipped squadrons were re-equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Vengeances continued {{to be used in}} training and support roles with the RAAF until 1946, and some were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy between 1948 and 1950 for ground training.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments {{to limit the}} president to a single six-year term and make {{the president and the}} Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Gustav spanned eleven days, from August 25 to September 4, 2008. The tropical disturbance which eventually spawned Hurricane Gustav gathered on August 16, {{southwest of the}} Cape Verde islands, but <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> develop as it trekked west across the Atlantic. Upon reaching the warm waters of Caribbean Sea it began to organize and became a tropical depression on August 25. It quickly strengthened to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane, before making landfall on Haiti's southwest peninsula. Gustav was severely disrupted by Hispaniola's mountains and stalled, disorganized, in the Gulf of Gonâve between August 26 and 27.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities for African Americans {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E

5|$|The {{name for}} the bikini design was coined in 1946 by Parisian {{engineer}} Louis Réard, the designer of the bikini. He named the swimsuit after Bikini Atoll, where testing on the nuclear bomb was taking place. Fashion designer Jacques Heim, also from Paris, re-released a similar design earlier that same year, the Atome. Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> be adopted. In many countries it was banned from beaches and public places. While still considered risqué, the bikini gradually {{became a part of}} popular culture when film starsBrigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, Ursula Andress and othersbegan wearing them on public beaches and in film.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{is almost}} entirely {{surrounded}} by water; the Bridgewater Canal forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> generate the predicted volume of traffic, so {{in the early days}} the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo and boating. British Westinghouse was the first major company to move in, and by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000workers then employed in the park, which {{became one of the most}} important engineering facilities in Britain.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>to</b> introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E
