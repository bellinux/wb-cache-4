5|$|In September 2017, TfL {{proposed}} various station improvements {{including a}} second entrance on Procter Street to the north-east of the station, lifts to provide step free access, and new tunnels {{to improve the}} interchange between the Central and Piccadilly lines. If permission is granted, the upgrade work is estimated to take six years and <b>will</b> <b>more</b> than double {{the size of the}} station, greatly increasing its capacity.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there <b>will</b> <b>more</b> false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table <b>will</b> <b>more</b> readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} {{began with the}} {{original}} cast from the first season. Amanda Tapping returns as series protagonist Helen Magnus, a 158-year-old English scientist who runs the Sanctuary Network. The producers intended for Magnus to be more angry and vulnerable following Ashley's death after the first three episodes. Robin Dunne returns as Will Zimmerman, a former forensic psychiatrist who has been Magnus' protégé since the pilot. After the first season, the producers made <b>Will</b> <b>more</b> confrontational towards Magnus after feeling more comfortable working with her. Christopher Heyerdahl portrays two characters: Bigfoot, an abnormal {{who works in the}} Sanctuary, and John Druitt, Magnus' former fiancé and father to Ashley. Ryan Robbins returns as Henry Foss. A recurring actor in the first season, Robbins was upgraded to a series regular in the second.|$|E

40|$|Pressures {{to change}} in {{organizations}} administered on bureaucratic lines and using the production techniques of "scientific management" are deriving from certain intrinsic attributes of these systems and from changing attributes of the environment. These changes constitute attempts to introduce greater fluidity into organizational structures and attempts to diffuse power. To {{the extent that they}} are implemented they imply that future management <b>will</b> centre <b>more</b> on sociological and psychological data, <b>will</b> become <b>more</b> experimental and less directive in style, <b>will</b> focus <b>more</b> on organizational (as against departmental) concerns and <b>will</b> become <b>more</b> responsive to external groupings. They imply also that managers <b>will</b> be judged <b>more</b> by results than by the opinion of peers, that they <b>will</b> be <b>more</b> exposed to challenge and criticism, that they will be held responsible for the quality of the work experience of their subordinates and that their own careers will be less orderly. ...|$|R
25|$|Most NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists are metabolized in the liver. Frequent {{administration of}} most NMDA receptor antagonists {{can lead to}} tolerance, whereby the liver <b>will</b> <b>more</b> quickly eliminate NMDA receptor antagonists from the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they <b>will</b> <b>more</b> readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, {{because they know that}} they are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion {{has been}} linked to higher {{sensitivity}} of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they <b>will</b> <b>more</b> intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater.|$|E

25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may neglect the true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then neglect the side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then neglect {{the left side of}} the adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients <b>will</b> <b>more</b> significantly neglect {{the left side of the}} barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients <b>will</b> <b>more</b> significantly neglect the left side of the object, even though it is now on the right side of space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
25|$|Situs inversus also complicates organ {{transplantation}} operations as donor organs <b>will</b> <b>more</b> likely come from situs solitus (normal) donors. As hearts and livers are chiral, geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped {{in the mirror}} image. For example, a person with situs inversus who requires a heart transplant needs all the vessels to the transplant donor heart reattached to their existing ones. However, the orientation of these vessels in a person with situs inversus is reversed, necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} probability is one {{sufficient to}} undermine {{confidence in the}} outcome. When the defendant challenges his conviction, he must show that counsel's errors prevented the jury from forming a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. When he challenges a death sentence, as Washington is doing, he must show a reasonable probability that the sentencer would have balanced the aggravation and mitigation evidence differently. The assessments must be made, of course, {{with respect to the}} totality of the evidence presented at the hearing so that when the prosecution's case is weak, the defendant <b>will</b> <b>more</b> easily show prejudice.|$|E

We <b>will</b> spend <b>more</b> time on listening comprehension part of the homework. This means that we will go over listening comprehension in a more detailed way in class. In addition to asking you to understand the listening materials, I will also ask you to retell the materials.

25|$|Sikh martial art Gatka was {{developed}} in the North by sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib and it was further developed and preached by tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. Gatka is associated with the Sikhs history and an integral part of an array of Sikh Shastar Vidiya developed during 15th century for self-defense. Southern styles like also make use of this technique but <b>will</b> <b>more</b> often use both ends of the staff to strike. The latter is the more common method of attacking in the eastern states and Bangladesh, combined with squatting and frequent changes in height.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} a 5% {{reduction}} in operating voltage <b>will</b> <b>more</b> than double {{the life of the}} bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.|$|E
25|$|Most {{evaluations}} of O–A relationships do not evaluate species over their entire (global) range, but document abundance and occupancy patterns {{within a specific}} region. It is believed that species decline in abundance and become more patchily distributed towards the margin of their range. If this is true, then it can be expected that as a species expands or contracts its range within the region of interest, it <b>will</b> <b>more</b> or less closely resemble populations {{at the core of}} its range, leading to a positive intraspecific O–A relationship. In the same manner, an assemblage of species within the study region can be expected to contain some species near the core and some near the periphery of their ranges, leading to a positive interspecific O–A relationship. Although this explanation may contribute to the understanding of O–A relationships where partial ranges are considered, it cannot explain relationships documented for entire geographic ranges.|$|E

25|$|Emily Pronin {{has argued}} that the {{subjective}} experience of free will is supported by the introspection illusion. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people <b>will</b> <b>more</b> readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.|$|E
25|$|This {{uncommon}} modern formation {{focuses on}} ball possession in the midfield. In fact, {{it is very}} rare {{to see it as}} an initial formation, as it is more useful for maintaining a lead or tie score. Its more common variants are 3–4–2–1 or 3–4–3 diamond, which use two wing-backs. The lone forward must be tactically gifted, not only because he focuses on scoring but also on playing the ball back towards the own goal to assist with back passes to his teammates. Once the team is leading the game, there is an even stronger tactical focus on ball control, short passes and running down the clock. On the other hand, when the team is losing, {{at least one of the}} playmakers <b>will</b> <b>more</b> frequently play in the edge of the area to add depth to the attack. Guus Hiddink is one of the few coaches who has used this formation, recently for Australia during the 2006 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but <b>will</b> <b>more</b> usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E
