5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh <b>water</b> <b>inlets</b> are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least for the near future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{improving}} {{the performance of}} a waste heat driven adsorption chiller by applying a novel composite adsorbent which is synthesized from activated carbon impregnated by soaking in sodium silicate solution and then in calcium chloride solution. Modeling is performed to analyze the influence of the hot <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, cooling <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, chilled <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures, and adsorption/desorption cycle time on the specific cooling power (SCP) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller system with the composite adsorbent. The simulation calculation indicates a COP value of 0. 65 with a driving source temperature of 85 °C in combination with coolant <b>inlet</b> and chilled <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature of 30 °C and 14 °C, respectively. The most optimum adsorption-desorption cycle time is approximately 360 s based on the performance from COP and SCP. The delivered chilled water temperature is about 9 °C under these operating conditions, achieving a SCP of 380 W/kg. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
