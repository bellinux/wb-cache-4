5|$|Somervell still pursued his own designs, making {{important}} changes, {{including the}} addition of a fifth story. The outbreak of war led to a new urgency, and by May 1942, some 13,000 workers were <b>working</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> on the building, which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $63 million, the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and {{the addition of}} the extra floor. For his work with the Construction Division, Somervell was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{roadshow}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. The Disneys had secured a year's lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound, which took personnel a week <b>working</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to install. Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society for the efforts in the Battle of Britain. Ticket demand {{was so great that}} eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings. Fantasia ran at the Broadway for forty-nine consecutive weeks, the longest run achieved by a film at the time. Its run continued for a total of fifty-seven weeks until February 28, 1942.|$|E

Rodgers and his subcontractors crossed the picket lines and were able to earn a bonus for completing the project two days early, which was accomplished by <b>working</b> on shifts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> <b>The</b> $50,000 bonus was turned over to local Boy and Girl Scout groups.|$|R
25|$|Cebus {{special mission}} was {{providing}} shops and trained {{men for the}} repair of internal combustion engines, but {{through the course of}} the war, her men performed a variety of tasks, ranging from the repairing of ship's clocks to major work on battleships. She arrived at Manus in the Admiralty Islands 10 September 1944. At this fleet base, she prepared small craft and larger ships for their role in the Philippine operations, <b>working</b> many times <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in order to insure the readiness of ships vital to the invasion assaults.|$|R
5|$|The {{range of}} the B-2 was not sufficient, and it was dropped in favour of the Ju 87 R {{long-range}} versions {{in the second half}} of 1940. The 105 R-1s were converted to R-2 status and a further 616 production R-2s were ordered. In May 1941, the development of the D-1 was planned and was ordered into production by March 1942. However, the expansion of the Junkers Ju 88 production lines to compensate for the withdrawal of Dornier Do 17 production delayed production of the Ju 87 D. The Weserflug plant in Lemwerder experienced production shortfalls. This prompted Erhard Milch to visit and threaten the company into meeting the RLM's Ju 87 D-1 requirements on 23 February 1942. To meet these demands, 700 skilled workers were needed. Skilled workers had been called up for military service in the Wehrmacht. Junkers were able to supply 300 German workers to the Weserflug factory, and as an interim solution, Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet civilians deported to Germany. <b>Working</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> the shortfall was made good. WFG received an official commendation. By May 1942, demand increased further. Chief of Procurement General Walter Herthel found that each unit needed 100 Ju 87s as standard strength and an average of 20 per month to cover attrition. Not until June–December 1942 did production capacity increase, and 80 Ju 87s were produced per month.|$|E

5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals <b>working</b> almost <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|R

No immediate solutions {{were being}} revealed by engineers <b>working</b> all but <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> {{their backs to}} the two walls of production tooling requirements and the need to freeze a design to begin emission certification. Ed Cole and his top engineer Frank Winchell, had taken personal charge of the project and had stopped work on all other GM-rotaries to focus on the problems of the Vega RC2-206 Wankel. A month later it was clear the Wankel would not be ready for either production or emissions certification in time {{for the start of the}} 1975 model year. A new model had now been planned to showcase the engine; The 1975 Vega-based Monza 2+2.On December 21, 1973 when GM paid another $10 million against its rotary licence fees, the company announced the first postponement.|$|R

Demand was high, with thousands of people travelling each day. In 1903, a number of old horse-drawn Wellington trams were converted into cable car trailers, increasing capacity. By 1912, the annual number of passengers had reached one million. In 1933, the steam-powered winding gear was replaced by an electric motor, improving control and reducing operating costs.|$|E

The {{furnaces}} required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen <b>working</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea. The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively generously there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a massive}} and {{difficult}} iron and charcoal making operation need a massive and hardened workforce. The furnace alone needed {{as many as}} sixty people <b>working</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> in twelve-hour shifts. The iron works support staff included a company clerk, a host of teamsters, woodcutters, the colliers, farmers and household servants. There was a wide gap between the classes. Workers were housed in small homes and worked very hard for low wages. The owners and supervisors of the furnace lived in mansions with sizable servant staffs. Historians have likened life at the furnace to life in a feudal barony.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by <b>working</b> his men <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{has always}} had a massive impact on human health and welfare. Unfortunately, the public only realizes the {{magnitude}} of this impact when very few engineering disasters occur, like huge oil spells in the sea or the failure of an aero-plane or a building. This is in spite of the plethora of engineering systems <b>working</b> perfectly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to enhance every miniature aspect of public health and welfare. The ethical dimension of the engineering profession deals with the interaction with the public. However, engineering ethics are critical for reasons beyond keeping out of legal trouble and guarding {{the health and safety of}} humans. Ethics are necessary for the survival and continuity of the profession itself, amongst other reasons. Therefore, engineering codes of ethics have been set by professional societies and engineering ethics have been emphasized by accreditation organizations to be an integral part of the engineering curricula. In addition, ethics is the framework that allows the handling of evolving issues related to the profession of engineering. Examples of these issues include the globalization of the practice, continuous professional development (CPD) of the practitioners, and issues of emerging technologies (e. g. nanotechnology). In the midst of this huge dimension, the engineering instructor is challenged to incorporate engineering ethics in a packed curriculum. This paper will provide a quick overview of the basic concepts and definitions of engineering ethics as well as the importance of studying engineering ethics. Some recent engineering ethics challenges will be listed with focus on globalization, its influence on the professional and ethical side of the profession, and the perspective of the educator. Moreover, some suggested strategies and best practices to integrate engineering ethics in the curriculum will be discussed...|$|R
