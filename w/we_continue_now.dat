40|$|Local {{algorithm}} for r = 2 In {{the last}} lecture we discussed Small Word Graphs. <b>We</b> <b>continue</b> <b>now</b> with a proof that when r = 2, {{there exists a}} local algorithm to find a short path from a source vertex s, to a destination vertex t, in O(log n) steps. We reuse Kleinberg’s [1] algorithm from Lecture 15. Algorithm: At each step, select an edge that gets you closest to the destination. Proof: In order to show that this algorithm takes O(log n) steps, we will divide it into phases. We {{will say that the}} algorithm is in phase j if the distance between the current vertex u, and the destination vertex t, is in the range (2 j, 2 j+ 1] as shown in Figure 1. Thus, the expected running time is equal to the expected number of phases, which is O(log n), multiplied by the expected time spent in each phase. Figure 1 : Escape from phase j into phase j + 1. First recall that for small world graphs we have P (u → v) ∝ d −r (u, v) or, equivalently for r = 2 : P (u → v) = where the denominator is a normalizing factor. d− 2 (u, v) w̸=u d− 2 (u, w...|$|E

30|$|Among special {{function}}s, the hypergeometric function {{has perhaps}} {{the widest range}} of applications. For instance, several well-known classes of special functions such as complete elliptic integrals, Legendre functions, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, and some elementary functions, such as the logarithm, are particular cases of it, cf. [1]. In a recent article [2] the authors studied various extensions of the Bernoulli inequality for functions of logarithmic type. In particular, the zero-balanced hypergeometric function F(a, b; a + b; x), a, b > 0 occurs in these studies, {{because it has a}} logarithmic singularity at x = 1, see (2.8) below. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>continue</b> the discussion of some of the questions for quotients and differences of hypergeometric functions that were left open in [2].|$|R

40|$|Verifying systems using net unfoldings to {{represent}} the state space is a process containing two steps: generation of the unfolding and reasoning about the unfolding.

In particular, we show how to use a SAT-solver to solve the coverability problem for unbounded Petri nets. The results of our experiments show that the use of unfoldings, in spite of the two-step process, has better time and space characteristics than an implementation that does not use unfoldings.
