These pumps can suffer from erosion due to cavitation, which eventually causes an increase in leakage and reduced performance.

Pressure ripple and flow ripple measurements were performed on a range of fuel pumps with bearing conditions ranging from good to badly worn. The flow ripple was determined indirectly by analysis of pressure ripple measurements. Results suggest that there is a clear and fairly consistent increase in the pressure ripple and flow ripple measured at the high-pressure outlet port when the bearing is in a worn condition. This increase seems to occur at a wear condition that is not sufficiently bad to worsen the pump performance significantly.

40|$|Contact surfaces, {{subjected}} to high pressure coupled with low-amplitude oscillation, {{are used to}} a great extent in aerospace engine components to reduce vibrations. Relative displacement of contact surfaces coupled with friction force dissipates energy and damps the vibrations. Fretting wear is harmful on interference-fit contacts because the loss of material reduces the normal load and hence, reduces their effectiveness in damping vibrations. Coating is an important means to control friction and wear of contact surfaces. To address this issue an experimental layout was designed, and fretting wear tests were performed at high temperature (1000 °C). A representative sphere-flat contact was investigated in laboratory environment. Two types of metal-ceramic coatings, made of the same metal but with a different alumina percentage, were tested.

40|$|Fretting wear is the {{material}} damage of two contact surfaces caused by micro relative displacement. Its characteristic is that debris is trapped on the contact surfaces. Depending on {{the material}} properties, {{the shapes of the}} debris, and the dominant wear mechanisms, debris can play different roles that either protect or harm interfaces. Due to the micro scale of the debris, it is difficult to obtain instantaneous information and investigate debris behavior in experiments. The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to model the process of fretting wear and calculate contact variables, such as contact stress and relative slip during the fretting wear process. In this research, a 2 D fretting wear model with a debris layer was developed to investigate the influence of debris on fretting wear. Effects of different factors such as thickness of the debris layer, Young’s modulus of the debris layer, and the time of importing the layer into the FE model were considered in this study. Based on FE results, here we report that: (a) the effect of Young’s modulus of the debris layer on the contact pressure is not significant; (b) the contact pressure between the debris layer and the flat specimen decreases with increasing thickness of the layer and (c) by importing the debris layer in different fretting wear cycles, the debris layer shows different roles in the wear process. At the beginning of the <b>wear</b> <b>cycle,</b> the debris layer protects the contact surfaces of the first bodies (cylindrical pad and flat specimen). However, in the final cycle, the wear volumes of the debris layers exhibit slightly higher damage compared to the model without the debris layer in all considered cases...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The report of investigation of the wear behaviour of aluminium alloy samples used in the floating calliper of master cylinder clutch or brake is presented in this paper. As-received commercial aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile hydraulic brake cylinder calliper was melted in electric furnace under a controlled atmosphere, and sand cast at pouring temperature range of 700 - 800 oC into rod of 300 mm long by 30 mm diameter. A wear jig {{was used to determine}} the wear resistance of the aluminium samples with and without the use of hydraulic fluid. The microstructures and surface of the as-received and cast specimen were examined under high resolution microscope to assess the effects of wear with and without hydraulic oil. It was observed that the aluminium sample wears faster in the absent of hydraulic fluid and was reduced to a bearable minimum when hydraulic fluid was applied. The results obtained are presented in figures showing the wear rates and weight loss of the aluminium samples with respect to the <b>wear</b> <b>cycle,</b> from which models equations are derived. The test results show that eutectic structured cast aluminium alloy behaves relatively better than the as-received aluminium alloy specimen in oil.

The focus of the tribology science on friction, wear and lubrication plays important role in reducing losses, increasing energy efficiency and determining the component’s life span, especially for the high forces and rapid movement components. In sliding contact, researchers divided the <b>wear</b> <b>cycle</b> into three important phases: running-in, steady state phase and accelerated wear/wear out phase. On the steady-state phase, the adjustment of the wear rate, contact pressure, surface roughness, and surface conformability at the contact interface attains the stabilized condition. The aims {{of this research is}} to model the steady state phase, incorporates mild wear, by employing the analytical, numerical and experimental solutions. Hertz’s analytical formula for elastic contact was developed to predict the wear on the steady state phase of the point and line contacts. The finite element analysis (FEA) is simulated to observe the contact pressure of the sliding contact on a pin-on-disc contact system. In the FEA, the input are geometry, boundary condition, material properties and initial load. Then, the obtained contact pressure is use in wear calculation based on Archard’s wear law by considering the sliding distance. The wear depth of pin for conformal and non-conformal contact is predicted. The ball-on-disc experiment was conducted to verify the wear prediction based on the analytical and the FEA solution. The analytical, FEA and experimental solution show that the wear on the running-in phase increases dramatically until reaching the steady state phase, where the stable condition occurs. In the analytical solution, the steady state phase is identified as the stabilized wear rate for the increasing of the sliding distance. In the FEA solution, the steady state phase is recognized by observing the stabilized contact pressure on the contact area as the sliding distance increases. Combination of the FEA solution and Archard’s wear law predicts the stabilized wear rate on the sliding contact. Experimental observation agrees well with the FEM and analytical solution where the wear of the ball is initially high and reaches its stabile condition at steady state phase. The interesting phenomenon in sliding contact of ball-on-disc discloses that the radius of the ball increases as the sliding distance increase. The ratio of the initial radius to the worn radius of the contacting ball tends to reach zero when the steady state phase is obtained. Key words: steady state, mild-wear, conformal contact, non-conformal contact, FEA. ...|$|E

In the UK, cyclists are predominantly male and often <b>wear</b> distinctive <b>cycle</b> clothing rather than everyday clothes. This is not the case in higher-cycling countries such as the Netherlands and Germany. It has been argued that the UK's demographic skewing may be partly due to poor quality infrastructure which can be off-putting for many, but particularly for women, children and older people. Route choice studies tend to confirm that women are {{more likely than men to}} choose routes with greater levels of separation from motor traffic. Other work suggests that if cycling feels unsafe, cyclists may <b>wear</b> specialised <b>cycle</b> clothing such as helmets, which then may itself support a perception of cycling as dangerous. This small-scale exploratory study examines age, gender, and use of specialist clothing in relation to infrastructure type, comparing a recently improved route with separate space for cyclists to parallel busy streets without protected cycle infrastructure. The separated route showed better, though still unequal, demographic balance and a reduced tendency for cyclists to wear helmets and sporty clothing, though not high-visibility items. Infrastructure type is only one factor in route choice, particularly if there is relatively little good infrastructure along key desire lines. However this paper suggests that infrastructure for cycling could help to improve perceptions of safety and the need to <b>wear</b> specialist <b>cycle</b> clothing.

Based on our observations, a sequence of micron-scale wear mechanisms is proposed involving: 1) a short adhesive wear regime (< 104 cycles), where the oxide is worn away and the first silicon debris particles form and 2) a regime dominated by abrasive wear, where silicon particles (50 – 100 nm) are created by fracture through the grains (∼ 500 nm).

Results: ANOVA showed that mean wear rate of the teeth in both 1000 and 2000 cycles had significant differences (p value < 0. 001). According to Duncan test, except for Apple and Yaghoot, other groups had significant differences with each other (p value 2 = 0. 314), (p value 1 = 0. 289). Conclusion: It was concluded from {{the results of the present}} study that wear rate of Ivoclar teeth was significantly lower than that in other groups. Glamour, Yaghoot and Apple teeth showed the highest rate of wear, respectively. Key words: Acrylic, Artificial teeth, Resin base, Resin tooth, Wear, Wear resistance...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the tribological properties of hair fibres is reported, {{and the effect of}} surface treatment on the evolution of friction and wear during sliding. Specifically, orthogonally crossed fibre/fibre contacts under a compressive normal load over a series of 10, 000 cycle studies are investigated. Reciprocating sliding at a velocity of 0. 4 mm/s − 1, over a track length of 0. 8 mm, was performed at 18 o C and 40 - 50 % relative humidity. Hair fibres retaining their natural sebum were studied, as well as those stripped of their sebum via hexane cleaning, and hair fibres conditioned using a commercially available product. Surface topography modifications resulting from wear were imaged using scanning electron microscopy and quantified using white light interferometry. Hair fibres that presented sebum or conditioned product at the fibre/fibre junction exhibited initial coefficients of friction at least 25 % lower than those that were cleaned with hexane. Coefficients of friction were observed to depend on the directionality of sliding for hexane cleaned hair fibres after sufficient <b>wear</b> <b>cycles</b> that cuticle lifting was present, typically on the order 1, 000 cycles. Cuticle flattening was observed for fibre/fibre junctions exposed to 10 mN compressive normal loads, whereas loads of 100 mN introduced substantial cuticle wear and fibre damage...|$|R
