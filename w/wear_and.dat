5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{replacing}} parts became an increasing problem.

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E

5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date, and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion endured a temporary closure due to unanticipated <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> tear from August 1014.|$|E
5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named her line of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world {{and give her a}} sense of comfort. Kurosaki was inspired by the film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to <b>wear,</b> <b>and</b> how the main character's bedroom is colored pastel pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
5|$|Military {{camouflage}} patterns {{have been}} popular in fashion and art from {{as early as}} 1915. Camouflage patterns {{have appeared in the}} work of artists such as Andy Warhol and Ian Hamilton Finlay, sometimes with an anti-war message. In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military clothing or imitations of it have been used both as street <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> as a symbol of political protest.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there was a difference in stability between shoe <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> non-shoe <b>wearing</b> individuals. Twenty shoe <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> twenty non-shoe <b>wearing</b> subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 performed balance tasks under six altered sensory conditions using a commercial balance system. Analysis of variance results indicated there was no difference in stability between the shoe <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> non-shoe <b>wearing</b> groups in each condition. There was a significant (p 3 ̆c. 05) condition effect. The results of this study demonstrates that non-shoe wearing does not influence the somatosensory system 2 ̆ 7 s ability to maintain an individual 2 ̆ 7 s stability...|$|R
