5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>returned</b> to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E

The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>returned</b> to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E
