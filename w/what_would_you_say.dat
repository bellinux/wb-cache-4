2500|$|Around 1880, {{when the}} anti-liberal pole was {{organizing}} {{itself into the}} Conservative Party, Fleva was being identified by his adversaries as a main exponent of a new National Liberal ideology and morality. Writing for Timpul, the national conservative poet and essayist Mihai Eminescu stirred passions with his radical critique of this emerging group, nominating Fleva alongside Pherekyde and others as [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "superimposed" [...] enemies of national development. In one of his lampoons, published in August 1882, Eminescu uses analogy to suggest that Pherekyde's shadow cabinet was an anti-national abomination: [...] "Dear people! <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> if the Chancellor of Germany were named Pherekydes, if its ministers were named Carada, Fleva and Chirițopol , if in that somewhere where all people have names like Meyer and Müller, all of its governing class were foreign?

Yallop could be dull; if Dean Jones set the pulses of Melbourne grandmothers racing {{like a couple of}} shandies over lunch, then Yallop was the comforting mug of Milo who put them back to sleep. He was decidedly more at home when the spinners were on. He was also, {{especially}} at his 1983 peak, the epitome of rocklike solidity. And yes, he was a fatally flawed, forlorn captain... He was unimaginative, tactically unsophisticated and lacked the respect of his players. And because he had predicted they would win 6–0, in the dumbest press conference any Australian captain ever gave... More than anyone, Yallop suffered from the chaos of ... He was used and abused at every turn. He is not the only Australian batsman of the last 25 years to have been mistreated by selectors... But Yallop was the first, and arguably copped the rawest deal, of them all.... Graham Yallop in three words? Unlucky Uncelebrated Unmissed seem to fit best, more's the pity.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{six years}} after A ribbon of poems was {{published}} about 100 copies were sold. The first edition consisted of sewed books, printed by printer Joh. Enschedé and sons. The cover was designed by Ludwig Willem Reymert Wenckebach. The cover of the second edition, which was published by L.J. Veen in 1893, was designed by P. de Josselin de Jong, made after an idea of Louis Couperus and printed by printer H.C.A. Thieme (Nijmegen). Of this edition of about 350-500 copies, in 1905 135 still remained with the publisher, who let 25 copies bind in a blue cover with red page cuts. L.J. Veen acquired the right to publish Couperus' poetry editions A ribbon of poems and [...] Orchids in 1892 and announced a reprint of A ribbon of poems in December of that same year. After he was notified Couperus wrote to Veen: If you like my poetry that much <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> if we publish another book with verses; he wanted to include the poems called Fragment (renamed to Melancholy) Viviane, Williswinde, Ginevra, Semiramis and Fragments from the Apocapyps of John the Apostle. Veen however refused this offer {{because he was not}} interested in an enlarged reprint of Orchids. At the beginning of December 1894 Couperus informed Veen that he agreed with a reprint of Orchids and a new book {{with the rest of his}} verses for the sum of 200 guilders.|$|E
