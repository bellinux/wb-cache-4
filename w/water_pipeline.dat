40|$|Abstract—Corrosion of {{metallic}} <b>water</b> <b>pipelines</b> buried {{below ground}} surface {{is a function}} of the nature of the surrounding soil and groundwater. This gives the importance of knowing the physical and chemical characteristics of the pipe’s surrounding environment. The corrosion of externally – unprotected metallic <b>water</b> <b>pipelines,</b> specially ductile iron pipes, in localities with aggressive soil conditions is becoming a significant problem. Anticorrosive protection for metallic <b>water</b> <b>pipelines,</b> their fittings and accessories is very important, because they may be attached by corrosion with time. The tendency of a metallic substrate to corrode {{is a function of}} the surface characteristics of the metal and of the metal/protective film interface, the physical, electrical and electrochemical properties of the film, and the nature of the environment in which the pipelines system is placed. In this work the authors have looked at corrosion problems of <b>water</b> <b>pipelines</b> and their control. The corrosive properties of groundwater and soil environments are reviewed, and parameters affecting corrosion are discussed. The purpose of this work is to provide guidelines for materials selection in water and soil environments, and how the <b>water</b> <b>pipelines</b> can be protected against metallic corrosion...|$|R

5|$|In August 1916, a {{combined}} Ottoman and German Empire army {{had been forced}} to retreat to Bir el Abd, after the British victory in the Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory stretching from the Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces by destroying water cisterns and wells.|$|E
5|$|The British then {{established}} garrisons {{along their}} supply lines, which {{stretched across the}} Sinai from the Suez Canal. Patrols and reconnaissances were regularly carried out to protect the advance of the railway and <b>water</b> <b>pipeline,</b> built by the Egyptian Labour Corps. These supply lines were marked by railway stations and sidings, airfields, signal installations and standing camps where troops could be accommodated in tents and huts. At this time the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) had a ration strength of 156,000 soldiers, plus 13,000 Egyptian labourers.|$|E
5|$|With {{the victory}} at Magdhaba the {{occupation}} of El Arish was secure. This was the first town captured on the Mediterranean coast and infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 5th Mounted Yeomanry Brigade quickly began to fortify the town. The Royal Navy arrived on 22 December 1916, and supplies began landing on the beaches near El Arish on 24 December. After {{the arrival of the}} railway on 4 January 1917 followed by the <b>water</b> <b>pipeline,</b> El Arish quickly developed into a major base for the EEF.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, both sides had large numbers of troops available for redeployment, and the British decided to move their Suez Canal defences from positions on the canal eastwards into the Sinai desert. Murray aimed to extend the railway and <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> to Katia, so that a permanent forward Imperial base of 50,000 men could be established. In February 1916, he requested permission from the War Office in London to extend this infrastructure further across the Sinai to El Arish. He considered that such an advance along the northern route, combined with the destruction of the central route's water sources and regular patrols from a base at El Arish, would permanently secure the Suez Canal. An advance to Katia was agreed by the War Office, but no decision was made regarding an advance to El Arish.|$|E
5|$|From late April 1916, after a German-led Ottoman force {{attacked}} British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire {{forces in}} the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew as rapidly as the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement at Little Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian <b>Water</b> <b>pipeline</b> at Little Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered an important and unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin was dry and forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except perhaps for seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E

5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Katia, {{also known}} as the Affair of Qatia by the British, was an {{engagement}} fought east of the Suez Canal and north of El Ferdan Station, in the vicinity of Katia and Oghratina, on 23 April 1916 during the Defence of the Suez Canal Campaign of World War I. An Ottoman force led by the German General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein made a surprise attack on three and a half squadrons of the British 5th Mounted Brigade, which was widely scattered to the east of Romani. The mounted brigade had been ordered to the area to protect the new railway and <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> being built from Kantara on the Suez Canal, as this infrastructure extended out past the Canal's zone of defences into the Sinai Peninsula towards Romani. Kress Von Kressenstein's attack was completely successful, decimating the equivalent of little more than a regiment. On the same day, an associated Ottoman attack on Duidar, very close to the Suez Canal, failed when it met with strong British opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E

5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In 1916 the infantry {{began to move}} to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing {{a pivotal role in}} fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australian's first saw combat during the Senussi uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro-Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3–5 August 1916, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and <b>water</b> <b>pipeline</b> could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February.|$|E
