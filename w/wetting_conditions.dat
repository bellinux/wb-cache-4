5000|$|The ADSS {{cable is}} {{suspended}} in the electrical field due to the phase conductors; this varies from a maximum at mid-span to zero at the grounded metal supports of the cable. In dry conditions, no current flows on the jacket of the cable, but moisture reduces the jacket insulation. Uneven distribution of moisture can result in formation of high-resistance [...] "dry bands" [...] which have a relatively high voltage across them. Dry bands tend to form at the supports. Voltage across the dry band can cause carbon tracks to form and erosion of the jacket material. If the voltage across the dry band is high enough, an arc may form which can damage the jacket. Dry-band arcing is more likely for cables installed under higher transmission voltage lines (220 kV and above). Even a few incidents of arcing along a dry band can cause severe permanent damage to the jacket, leading to subsequent failure of the cable. Relatively low sustained arc currents of a few milliamperes can cause eventual aging degradation of the cable. The magnitude of current available in an arc (and probability of damage) depends on the geometry of the installation and is not simply correlated with the voltage of the transmission line. <b>Wetting</b> <b>conditions</b> near industrial plants or saltwater will have more severe effect on the jacket resistance than in freshwater rain or fog. While one measure to protect cables from dry-banding damage incorporates a semiconducting layer to equalize potential, a more feasible method uses externally applied protection within 50 metres of each support, since this is the area most susceptible to damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{surface sealing}} {{is one of}} the main causes for low {{infiltration}} rate (IR) and high runoff and soil loss under raindrop impact conditions in arid and semiarid regions. Many studies have focused on the effects of soil properties on seal formation under fast <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, in the field, soils can be exposed to different <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions,</b> before an intense rainfall event, which can affect the role of the soil properties on seal formation. The present paper reviews the effects of different initial <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions</b> and their interactions with soil properties on seal formation, IR, runoff, and soil loss in smectitic soils. Fast wetting of soil causes aggregate slaking, which enhances seal formation, runoff, and soil loss under rainfall, mainly in soils with> 40 % clay content. An increase in clay content of the soil increases aggregate strength, but at the same time increases the slaking forces. Hence, in soils with low clay content ( 40 % clay content and high aggregate stability, slaking plays an important role in aggregate breakdown and seal formation. An increase of raindrop kinetic energy, from 8 to 15. 9 kJ/m 3, decreased the effect of the slaking forces on seal formation and runoff. It was suggested that the effects of raindrop kinetic energy and of the slaking forces on aggregate disintegration and seal formation are complementary. An increase in soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), from 0. 9 to 20. 4 %, decreased the effect of slaking forces on seal formation and runoff production under rainfall with 15. 9 kJ/m 3 kinetic energy. Probably, increasing the ESP increased the soi...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was an {{investigation}} of the influence of different storage conditions on the bond strength between cp-titanium and two veneering porcelains. Both porcelain compound systems were investigated with and without the use of porcelain bonder. The porcelains under investigation were Vita Titankeramik (Vita) and Triceram (Esprident). The titanium test specimens of I defined size of 25 mm x 3 mm x 0, 5 mm were individually manufactured at the dental laboratory Ticost (Brandenburg) as described in detail in chapter 3. 3. <<in the following, seven test specimens each were stored under different conditions: Triceram with porcelain bonder, Vita Titankeramik without porcelain bonder, all having been veneered as described in detail in chapter 3. 5. 28 test series were conducted with 7 test specimens of the four different types each under the following conditions: 28 test specimens were stored under dry conditions. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for on week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one week. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for one month. 28 test specimens were stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. The resulting bond strength was evaluated and their effects significantly higher bond strength could only be found for Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by water for six months as compared to Triceram with bonder stored under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> simulated by artificial saliva for six months. When no bonder is used a range of significant differences can be found: It can be stated that bond strengths decrease with the duration of storage. Similar results were found for Vita Titankeramik. With the use of bonder no significant differences in bond strength can be found. But again, if no bonder is used bond strength values decrease significantly over time. With porcelain veneered titanium a bonder should definitely be used and is indispensable. Even after short storage durations results do not differ significantly between dry storage <b>conditions</b> and <b>wet</b> storage <b>conditions.</b> The investigations show that with longer duration of storage under <b>wet</b> <b>conditions</b> bond strength will profit from the use of a bonder.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} {{investigated the}} predictive performance of pavement marking retroreflectivity measured {{under various conditions}} of continuous wetting. The researcher compared nighttime detection distance of pavement markings in simulated rain conditions and the retroreflectivity of the same pavement markings in several continuous <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions.</b> Correlation analyses quantified the predictive performance of the resulting retroreflectivity values from the continuous <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions.</b> The researcher measured the retroreflectivity of 18 pavement marking samples under 14 different conditions. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has three standards for measuring the retroreflectivity of pavement markings under: dry (E- 1710), recovery (E- 2177), and continuous <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions</b> (E- 2176). Using three ASTM standard conditions resulted in three sets of retroreflectivity data, and variations of the continuous wetting standard produced an additional 11 sets of continuous wetting condition data. The researcher also incorporated detection distance values measured for the same 18 pavement marking samples under three different simulated rainfall conditions at night. The three conditions included: high (0. 87 in/hr), medium (0. 52 in/hr), and low (0. 28 in/hr) flow rates, these rates were to simulate typical rainfall rates {{in the state of}} Texas. The correlation analyses measures the linear relationship as well as the logarithmic relationship between the detection distance and the retroreflectivity of the pavement markings. A pavement markings' retroreflectivity is typically used as a detection distance performance indicator, therefore a high degree of correlation between retroreflectivity and detection distance would be desired. A high degree of correlation would indicate that a measured retroreflectivity value of a pavement marking would provide a good indication of the expected detection distance. The researcher conducted analyses for several subgroups of the pavement markings based on the markings type or characteristics. Dry, recovery, and all the continuous wetting retroreflectivity data were correlated to the detection distances. Correlation values found during this thesis research did not show a high degree of correlation for most of the subgroups analyzed. This indicates that measured retroreflectivity would not provide very good predictive performance of the pavement markings detection distance in rainy conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature of Supercell coating, an on-line tablet coater that employed a unique pattern of airflow. Tablets coated at different spray rates (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions</b> on the quality of coats formed. Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet coats formed at a spray rate of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a spray rate of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other spray rates, and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together. At higher spray rates, the droplets appeared as branching arms and scale-like structures. This was attributed to the spread of spray droplets by the processing air and mass transfer of wet coating materials between tablets. Further tests showed that coats formed at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the mass transfer of coats and dissolution of tablet core surfaces by the coating material. Since coats of different characteristics can be formed in Supercell coating, the choice of <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions</b> would depend on the type of coat required and the coating materials used...|$|E

40|$|Using a phase-field {{model to}} {{describe}} fluid/fluid interfacial dynamics and a lattice Boltzmann model to address hydrodynamics, two dimensional (2 D) numerical simulations {{have been performed}} to understand the mechanisms of droplet formation in microfluidic T-juntion. Although 2 D simulations may not capture underlying physics quantitatively, our findings will help to clarify controversial experimental observations and identify new physical mechanisms. We have systematically examined the influence of capillary number, flow rate ratio, viscosity ratio, and contact angle in the droplet generation process. We clearly observe that {{the transition from the}} squeezing regime to the dripping regime occurs at a critical capillary number of 0. 018, which is independent of flow rate ratio, viscosity ratio, and contact angle. In the squeezing regime, the squeezing pressure plays a dominant role in the droplet breakup process, which arises when the emerging interface obstructs the main channel. The droplet size depends on both the capillary number and the flow rate ratio, but is independent of the viscosity ratio under completely hydrophobic <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the dripping regime, the droplet size will be significantly influenced by the viscosity ratio as well as the built-up squeezing pressure. When the capillary number increases, the droplet size becomes less dependent on the flow rate ratio. The contact angle also affects the droplet shape, size, and detachment point, especially at small capillary numbers. More hydrophobic wetting properties are expected to produce smaller droplets. Interestingly, the droplet size is dependent on the viscosity ratio in the squeezing regime for less hydrophobic <b>wetting</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E
