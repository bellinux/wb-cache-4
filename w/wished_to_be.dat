5|$|When Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} for Mbantua Gallery in central Australia, she indicated {{that her name}} was Josepha rather than Josie, {{and that this was}} how she henceforth <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known; however Mbantua's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name.|$|E
5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was carried}} back to Chinon on a litter, {{where he was}} {{informed}} that John had publicly sided with Richard in the conflict. This desertion proved the final shock and he finally collapsed into a fever, only coming to {{for a few moments}} during which he gave confession. Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E

5|$|The {{season was}} the first to be filmed in Los Angeles, after {{production}} was moved from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This move was done largely on the behest of Duchovny, who <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closer to his wife, Téa Leoni. Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, although series director Kim Manners and Anderson approved of it, although to a less-vocal degree than Duchovny. The first half of the season also saw Mimi Rogers and Chris Owens' characters—Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender, respectively—become recurring characters.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Ashworth left Liverpool {{midway through}} the {{following}} season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closer {{to his wife and}} daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.|$|E

When you were {{foremost}} among them, did you not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their master?

5|$|Boycott {{told the}} BBC in 1965 that {{he chose to}} leave school at 17 because he no longer <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{financial}} strain on his parents, and {{because he wanted to}} pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, at the same time playing for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team, and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation's Under-18 team, and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire's County Cricket team committee.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Nash {{rejected}} {{offers of}} a home posting and instead served as a trooper in New Guinea, stating that he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated no differently from any other soldier. Following {{the end of the}} war, Nash returned to South Melbourne and won the team goal kicking award, although his age and injuries inhibited any return of his previous successes. Nash retired from VFL football {{at the end of the}} 1945 season to play and coach in the country before returning to coach South Melbourne in 1953. After retiring, Nash wrote columns for newspapers, was a panellist on football television shows and was a publican before his death in Melbourne, aged 76.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Monteux had {{felt that he}} should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he {{believed}} that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free to accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO {{at the end of}} the 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.|$|E

5000|$|The Golden Rule: treat {{others as}} one would <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated. This assumes that all persons would <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued {{if they were in}} {{distress}}, and so they should in turn rescue those in distress {{to the best of their}} abilities. What counts as distress requiring rescue may, of course, differ from person to person, but being trapped or at risk of drowning are emergency situations which this position assumes all humans would <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued from.|$|R
5|$|Grissom {{asked to}} remain in Korea to fly another 25 flights, but his request was denied. He was given the option of {{choosing}} which base he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stationed at in the United States; he requested Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas. He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was born there in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
5|$|In 1323, Polo was {{confined}} to bed, due to illness. On January 8, 1324, despite physicians' efforts to treat him, Polo was on his deathbed. To write and certify the will, his family requested Giovanni Giustiniani, a priest of San Procolo. His wife, Donata, and his three daughters were appointed by him as co-executrices. The church was entitled by law to {{a portion of his}} estate; he approved of this and ordered that a further sum be paid to the convent of San Lorenzo, the place where he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried. He also set free Peter, a Tartar servant, who may have accompanied him from Asia, and to whom Polo bequeathed 100 lire of Venetian denari.|$|E
5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, the Life is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E

5|$|The {{date of the}} Gonzaga {{wedding was}} {{repeatedly}} postponed, because of diplomatic problems which delayed the bride's arrival in Mantua until 24 May. The wedding festivities began four days later; L'Arianna was performed on 28 May 1608, {{the first of the}} several spectacular entertainments. A large temporary theatre had been built for the occasion; according to the court's chronicler Federico Follino this held 6,000 people—a figure which Carter deems unlikely. Whatever its size, the arena could not hold everyone who <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present. Follino's account records that although the duke had strictly limited the numbers from his household entitled to be there, many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged to crowd around the doors.|$|E
5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with The Modern Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Hicks {{was born}} in 1919 in Orange, New Jersey, to William Lux Hicks, a {{chemical}} engineer, and Florence Benedict. Hicks decided {{at an early age}} that she <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a woman. She graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1939, one of only two women in her class. During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of Edward Weston's inventions and took additional classes at night.|$|E

5|$|Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine died in June 1717. Anna Maria Luisa {{returned}} home in October 1717, bringing with her vast treasures. Cosimo created his elder son's widow, Violante of Bavaria, Governess of Siena as to clearly define her precedence. That {{did not stop}} the two ladies from quarrelling, as was his intention. Cosimo discontinued hunting following an accident in January 1717. He accidentally shot, and killed, a man. He was so distraught, that he <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tried by the Knights of the Order of Saint Stephen. The state of the Grand Duchy reflected the decay of its ruler; in a 1718 military review, the army numbered less than 3000 men, {{some of whom were}} infirm, and aged 70. The navy composed of three galleys, and the crew 198. In September 1721, the Grand Duchess died; instead of willing her possessions to her children, as prescribed by the 1674 agreement; they went to the Princess of Epinoy.|$|E
5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash of dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E
5|$|MacPaint 2.0 was {{released}} on January 11, 1988 by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a non-movable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10". Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{able to use the}} program.|$|E
