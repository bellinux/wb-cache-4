The tests had no effect on the patent battle, but the Smithsonian made the most of them, honoring the Aerodrome in its museum and publications. The Institution did not reveal the extensive Curtiss modifications, but Orville Wright learned of them from his brother Lorin and a close friend of his and Wilbur's, Griffith Brewer, who both witnessed and photographed some of the tests.|$|E

He also held major titles in New Zealand and Puerto Rico. After retiring from wrestling, he began training aspiring wrestlers for both the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. He has moved to Calgary, Alberta and had several other jobs since retiring, but he continues to wrestle occasionally while visiting the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Neil {{stated that}} her {{motivation}} for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, {{and that they were}} a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities.|$|E

By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension. He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. He said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, {{who went on to}} play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

25|$|The first {{electronic}} autonomous robots {{with complex}} behaviour {{were created by}} William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that rich connections between {{a small number of}} brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.|$|E

America was about to enter World War I, and the sisters <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that women could ride {{as well as men}} and would be able to serve as military dispatch riders, freeing up men for other tasks.

500|$|In Liddell's account, Pickingill {{travelled}} {{widely and}} joined {{a variety of}} cunning lodges, gaining access to their grimoires and libraries.

According to Liddell, Pickingill's involvement with Freemasons also led to the foundation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888. Liddell also asserted that Pickingill was influenced by a coven that had been founded in the early nineteenth century by a group of Cambridge University academics led by Francis Barrett and whose rituals were based largely on Classical sources.|$|E
