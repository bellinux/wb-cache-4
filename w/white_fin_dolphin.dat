50|$|The Ella Bay area {{is home to}} a large {{variety of}} plant and animal life {{including}} iconic species like the endangered southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius johnsonii), endangered and vulnerable frog species including the Australian lace-lid, common mist frog and waterfall frog, remnant native plants and estuarine crocodiles. Ella Bay is regularly used by green sea turtles as a nesting site. Other threatened marine turtles may nest in this area though this has yet to be confirmed. The waters off Ella Bay are important shallow water habitat for coastal dolphin species including the endemic snub <b>fin</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the Indo-pacific humpback dolphin. Whales have been observed at Ella Bay including migrating humpback whales. Dugong have been observed at Ella Bay though the poor condition of seagrass beds in the area currently make this area less than optimal Dugong habitat.|$|R

50|$|These basslets prefer rocky environments {{like the}} rubble piles {{at the base}} of the reef. They may hide at first, but will become bolder with time. They may also become {{territorial}} around their area of the reef. Aside from a great personality (though somewhat territorial), the coloration of this fish is its greatest attribute. Its orange-red and pink lateral striping then baby blue or <b>white</b> <b>fins</b> with black spots make this a spectacular aquarium addition. As a carnivore, it readily accepts meaty meals including live brine and frozen prepared foods.|$|R
5000|$|In life Dichotomyctere kretamensis is {{olive green}} in color dorsally and {{laterally}} with round and oblong spots of varying sizes. Most specimens exhibit a black occipital chevron and a partially interrupted ventro-lateral black stripe {{running from the}} mouth below the eye and the pectoral fin that fades as it extends back to the vent. The ventral surface otherwise is <b>white.</b> <b>Fins</b> are unmarked and the caudal fin (tail) is dusky. [...] Based on the few specimens that have been measured, this fish has a maximum length of 4.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{base body}} color is {{yellowish}} green, with ill-defined, irregular brown to black spots. The {{underside of the}} fish is yellowish <b>white.</b> The <b>fins</b> are yellowish green with black spots.|$|R
50|$|Body {{moderately}} stout and compressed, preoral snout moderately long, {{about half}} of distance from mouth to pectoral origins; mouth narrowly arched, nearly half as high as wide. Second dorsal fin somewhat larger than first; pectoral apices when laid back ending about opposite to first dorsal spine origin. Caudal peduncle moderately long, distance from second dorsal insertion to upper caudal origin {{about as long as}} distance from eye to third gill slits. Lateral trunk denticles close-set, conical and with hooked cusps. Colour blackish, without <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> tips or prominent black markings on underside of body and sides oftail. Size moderate, adults- about 50 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{blackstripe topminnow}} gets {{its name from}} the {{horizontal}} black stripe that runs the length of its body along its sides. The fish has a small mouth that turns slightly upward, and has a flat-topped head with a multi-coloured spot on it. The average length of this fish is between 5 and 7 cm. The males and females look distinct from one another. Males have dark vertical bars above and below their stripes, yellow-hued fins, and their dorsal and anal fins are longer and more pointed. Females have no bars, <b>white</b> <b>fins</b> and shorter, more rounded dorsal and anal fins.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{specimens}} of the whitefin swellshark were often mistaken for the Australian swellshark (C. laticeps) or the draughtsboard shark (C. isabellum). In 1994, it {{was identified as}} a new species and known provisionally as Cephaloscyllium [...] "sp. A", until it was formally described by Peter Last, Hiroyuki Motomura, and William White, in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) publication. Its specific epithet albipinnum comes from the Latin albi meaning [...] "white", and pinna meaning [...] "fin", referring to its distinctive <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> margins. The type specimen is a 1.0 m long adult male caught near Maria Island, Tasmania.|$|R

50|$|A. omanensis has a forked {{caudal fin}} however its pelvic and anal fins {{are black and}} the mid bar is much narrower. The forked caudal fin {{distinguish}}es A. latifasciatus from A. allardi, A. bicinctus, A. chrysopterus and A. clarkii. The wide mid-body bar of A. latifasciatus also helps to distinguish it from these species. A. allardi, A. bicinctus and A. chrysopterus can also be distinguished by their <b>white</b> caudal <b>fin.</b> The wide color variation of A. clarkii {{makes it more difficult}} to distinguish by color alone, although the presence of a <b>white</b> caudal <b>fin</b> or <b>white</b> bar {{at the base of the}} caudal fin indicates the fish is not A. latifasciatus.|$|R
50|$|This shark is {{distinctive}} {{in being}} the only Centroscyllium species with abrupt black markings beneath its head, trunk, and pectoral fins, with a black stripe running from under the caudal peduncle to over the pelvic fins. These markings are in fact concentrations of tiny light-emitting photophores. Unusually, this shark also has photophores along the undersides of its upper eyelids. What function these structures could serve is unclear; Tchernavin speculated {{that they could be}} used to illuminate prey or stimulate the eye. The rest of the body is gray-brown, with <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> margins. There are numerous small cone-shaped, hooked prickles over the body, except for under the snout.|$|R
50|$|It {{feeds on}} {{plankton}} along coral reefs. Sexual dimorphism {{occurs in the}} species of angelfish, the male is larger with blackish pelvic fins and a yellow spot on the front head, whereas the smaller female has brighter (<b>white)</b> pelvic <b>fins.</b>|$|R
500|$|Like {{the grey}} reef shark, silvertip sharks {{sometimes}} perform a stereotypical threat display if pursued by divers, warning {{that it is}} prepared to attack. The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of , before turning and charging towards the perceived threat. At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and [...] "shivers". The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the [...] "shivering" [...] may serve to emphasize its <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> markings. If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.|$|R
50|$|The Arctic {{flounder}} is a right-eyed flatfish. Its {{upper side}} is dark olive green to dark brown in colour, sometimes with black spots or dark patches; its underside is <b>white.</b> Its <b>fins</b> are pale brown, sometimes {{with a yellow}} tinge or faint dark spots.|$|R
5000|$|The {{young are}} eel-like, usually almost black, with {{the margins of}} dorsal, anal and caudal fins red, but red ones have a {{distinct}} white snout.

500|$|The {{silvertip shark}} was {{originally}} described as Carcharias albimarginatus by German naturalist Eduard Rüppell, in the 1837 Fische des Rothen Meeres (Fishes of the Red Sea). The name was later changed to the currently valid Carcharhinus albimarginatus. The specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Latin albi meaning [...] "white", and marginatus meaning [...] "to enclose with a border", in reference to the distinct <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> margins. In 1960, a -long immature male caught off Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea was designated as the type specimen. Based on similarities in morphology, tooth shape, and vertebral characters, Garrick (1982) proposed the grey reef shark as the closest relative of the silvertip shark. This interpretation was corroborated by Lavery (1992), based on allozyme data.|$|R

A large crowd of men and women gather on the knoll around the large net-wrapped balloon. The building of the Hotel Raymond can be seen in the left distance. Knabenshue, a former resident of South Pasadena, is considered to be California's first intrepid dirigible navigator. He flew his airship from 1902 until 1910. In order to ascend, Knabenshue would walk to the back of the wooden frame track. In order to descent it was necessary to run to the front. The balloon was steered by hand with a large <b>white</b> <b>fin</b> on the aircraft's rear, and propelled by a small gas engine mounted on the frame...|$|R
50|$|The pudgy cusk-eel is {{a common}} fish of deep oceans worldwide. It is bathydemersal, living along the ocean floor most often at depths between 2000 and 3000 metres, and known from waters as deep as 4800 metres. It {{is one of the}} largest bony fishes living below 2000 meters, {{reaching}} up to 127 centimetres in length. The male is larger than the female and darker in colour. It has a long, laterally compressed body and a rounded snout with a single fleshy anterior nostril in front of a flat posterior nostril. The fish varies in coloration from pale with <b>white</b> <b>fins</b> to light brown to dark brown; individuals from the Atlantic Ocean are often pale while Pacific Ocean specimens are usually darker.|$|R
