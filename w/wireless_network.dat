40|$|AbstractTraditionally, Bandwidth-Delay Product {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the {{capacity}} of network “pipe” between two nodes. However, in multi-hop <b>wireless</b> <b>networks,</b> Bandwidth-Delay Product cannot reveal the network condition accurately. In this paper, we define a new metric called Delay-Bandwidth Product (DBP) for <b>wireless</b> <b>networks,</b> which measures the capacity of a one-hop pipe in <b>wireless</b> <b>networks.</b> <b>Wireless</b> <b>networks</b> with a large DBP can have a throughput larger than the one based on traditional understanding. We propose a scheduling algorithm aims for making use of the large DBP in <b>wireless</b> <b>networks.</b> We then design simulations to figure out how much throughput gains can be achieved in <b>wireless</b> <b>networks,</b> with small DBPs and large DBPs respectively. The simulation result demonstrates that we can achieve significant throughput gains in <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> with large DBP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — With the {{advancement}} in Networking and Telecommunication technologies {{and the increase}} in mobility necessities, <b>Wireless</b> <b>Networks</b> and its related technologies are becoming more popular nowadays. Since, <b>Wireless</b> and Mobile <b>Networks</b> are still evolving, the technology requires much more optimizations. The traditional Base Station (BS) based <b>Wireless</b> <b>networks</b> and Ad-hoc <b>Wireless</b> <b>networks,</b> apart from having their unique advantages, have some disadvantages too. So, we are working towards a new type of <b>Wireless</b> <b>Networks</b> called Hybrid <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> incorporating the advantageous features of both BS based and Ad-hoc <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> enabling the <b>wireless</b> end terminals to work in different modes based on the necessities and availabilities. The existing literature in Hybrid <b>Wireless</b> <b>Networks</b> does not include much work in overcoming the performance deterioration due to Interference and also the Power drain incurred because of retransmissions. We propose a novel method for Interference Avoidance and Power Management in the presented work...|$|R

5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough so far not as {{successful}} as managed wireless networking, an alternative type of <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> has also emerged since 2000 : spontaneous <b>wireless</b> <b>networks.</b> Inspired by the Push-To-Talk concept used in walkie-talkies (portable half-duplex radio transceivers developed during the Second World War), spontaneous <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> depart from the traditional distinction between router and hosts, whereby each user terminal (hereafter, node) may behave as a router and a host simultaneously. In spontaneous <b>wireless</b> <b>networks,</b> user terminals are thus ''prosumers" (i. e. both producers and consumers) of networking resources instead of mere consumers. Terminals self-organize to provide multi-hop wireless communications among themselves, with or without help/control from infrastructure devices. Each node may thus simultaneously originate/receive traffic (role of a host), as well as forward traffic on behalf of other terminals (role of a router). Popular examples of spontaneous <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> include mobile ad hoc <b>networks,</b> <b>wireless</b> mesh <b>networks,</b> <b>wireless</b> sensor or actuator <b>networks,</b> <b>wireless</b> smart meter <b>networks,</b> vehicular <b>networks,</b> opportunistic <b>wireless</b> <b>networks</b> or delay tolerant networks.
