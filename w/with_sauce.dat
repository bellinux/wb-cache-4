25|$|One such dish is mais moulu (mayi moulen), {{which is}} {{comparable}} to grits that can be eaten <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> pois (sòs pwa), a bean purée made from one of many types of beans such as kidney, pinto, chickpeas, or pigeon peas (known in some countries as gandules). Mais moulin can be eaten with fish (often red snapper), or alone depending on personal preference. Some of the many plants used in Haitian dishes include tomato, oregano, cabbage, avocado, bell peppers. A popular food is banane pesée (ban-nan'n peze), flattened plantain slices fried in cooking oil (known as tostones in the Spanish-speaking Latin American countries). It is eaten both as a snack {{and as part of}} a meal, and is often eaten with tassot and griot (deep-fried goat and pork).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to eat on a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E
500|$|Michael Winner {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} {{a couple of}} days after opening for The Times while dining with Michael Caine. Winner found that the hotel's entrance to the restaurant was still under refurbishment, and that the service was sub par with items being dropped by their waiter. Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood." [...] He called the desserts [...] "to die for", and stole Caine's dessert to eat in addition to his own. John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} line version, {{endorsed by}} the Kōeidō Honten, is that the family ran a ceramics merchant named [...] "" [...] for 7 generations running, until it switched business {{to that of a}} confectioner in 1856, changing the shop name to [...] "Kōeidō". According to this scenario, around 1856, Takeda Hanzō (半蔵), the retired predecessor of the family ceramics shop, was one of the three Okayama townsmen who collectively devised the new recipe that was somehow an improvement over the steamed millet dumpling [...] "rectangularly shaped like kakimochi, which did not keep well, and was eaten with red bean paste or <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> poured on top," [...] which was a common staple wherever the crop was harvested.|$|E

60|$|With great censure of the Stympsons' ill-breeding and discourtesy to {{her brother}} (which seemed to affect her {{far more than the}} direct injury to Harold), and strong disclaimers of belief in them, still my mother's old friend must inquire into the {{character}} of these young men and my position with regard to them. If she had been tender instead of inquisitorial, I should have answered far more freely, and most likely the air of defiance and defence into which she nettled me had a partisan look; but it was impossible not to remember that Miss Woolmer had always said that, however she might censure the scandal of the Stympsons, they only required to dish it up <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> piquant to make her enjoy it heartily.|$|E
60|$|It {{is quite}} true {{that we live}} almost entirely upon native food; our luncheon to-day {{consisted}} of raw fish <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> made of cocoanut milk mixed with sea water and lime juice, taro poi-poi, and bananas roasted in hot stones in a little pit in the ground, with cocoanut cream to eat with them. Still we like coffee in the evening, a little wine at dinner, {{and a few other}} products of civilisation. It would be possible, the chief said, to send a boat, but that would cost sixty dollars. A final arrangement, which we were forced to accept, was that Rui should go in his own boat, and the chief would appoint a substitute for some public work that he was then engaged upon. Early the next morning, amidst a raging sea and a storming wind, Rui departed with three men to help him. It is forty miles to Papeete, and Rui, starting in the early morning, arrived there at nine o'clock; but alas, the wind was against him, and it was altogether six days before he got back.|$|E
6000|$|Bonivard was {{set free}} {{by the united}} forces of Berne and Geneva, preaching {{political}} and religious liberty by the cannon's mouth, as has had so often to happen. That too must have seemed droll to Bonivard {{when he came to}} think it over in his humorous way. [...] "The epoch of the Renaissance and the Reformation was that of strong individualities and undaunted characters. But let no one imagine a resemblance between the prior of St. Victor and the great rebels his contemporaries, Luther, Zwinglius, and Calvin. Like them {{he was one of the}} learned men of his time; like them he learned to read the Evangels, and saw their light disengage itself from the trembling gleams of tradition; but beyond that he has nothing in common with them. Bonivard is not a hero; he is not made to obey or to command; he is an artist, a kind of poet, who treats high matters of theology in a humorous spirit; prompt of repartee, gifted with happy dash; his irony has lively point, and he likes to season the counsels of wisdom <b>with</b> <b>sauce</b> piquante and rustic bonhomie.... He prepares the way for Calvin, while having nothing of the Calvinist; he is gay, he is jovial; he has, even when he censures, I know not what air of gentleness that wins your heart." ...|$|E
