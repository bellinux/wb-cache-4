5|$|As <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} here, the Australian Constitution firmly {{places the}} prerogative {{powers of the}} Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the exact}} date Saint Padarn founded {{the church is}} uncertain, it seems clear however that Llanbadarn Fawr was an early sixth-century foundation, a Celtic clas church. The church {{may have been the}} seat of an abbot or bishop during the years {{immediately}} following Saint Padarn, who was traditionally said to be its first bishop (as a clas church, it was not a cathedral as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> term today, but closer to a collegiate church), nor did it necessarily possess any substantial buildings. It was one of the leading clasau of early Christian Wales, and the one we know most about, partly because of the significant role it played as a literary centre.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{complicated}} nature of rationalist thinking, {{the nature of}} philosophy, and the understanding that humans are aware of knowledge available only {{through the use of}} rational thought, many of the great philosophers from antiquity laid down the foundation for rationalism though they themselves weren't rationalists as <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concept today.|$|E

25|$|Irish {{settlers}} – both {{voluntary and}} forced – were {{crucial to the}} development of the Australian colonies from the earliest days of European settlement. The Irish first came over in large numbers as convicts (50,000 were transported between 1791 and 1867), to be used as free labour; even larger numbers of free settlers came during the 19th century, partly due to the Donegal Relief Fund. Irish immigrants accounted for one-quarter of Australia's overseas-born population in 1871. Their children, the first Irish Australians in the sense <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> term, played a definitive role in shaping Australian history, society and culture. It has been argued that the Irish language was the source of a significant number of words in Australian English.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of cognition.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett {{believed}} he owed [...] "a {{debt to the}} science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of" [...] and disliked the term [...] "magical realism" [...] which, he said, is [...] "like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, do not care that much." [...] He expressed annoyance that fantasy is [...] "unregarded as a literary form", arguing that it [...] "is the oldest form of fiction"; he described himself as [...] "infuriated" [...] when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.|$|E
500|$|On the {{day before}} the invasion, US President Gerald R. Ford and US Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger met with Indonesian {{president}} Suharto and reportedly gave their approval for the invasion. In response to Suharto saying [...] "We want your understanding if it was deemed necessary to take rapid or drastic action [...]" [...] Ford replied, [...] "We will understand and will not press you on the issue. <b>We</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> problem and the intentions you have." [...] Kissinger similarly agreed, though he had fears that the use of U.S.-made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny, talking of their desire to [...] "influence the reaction in America" [...] so that [...] "there would be less chance of people talking in an unauthorised way." [...] The US also hoped the invasion would be swift and not involve protracted resistance. [...] "It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly," [...] Kissinger said to Suharto.|$|E
500|$|As {{he disliked}} both Arabs and Christians, some scholars, such as Bowersock, have taken Zosimus' {{silence on the}} matter as strong {{evidence}} against Philip's alleged Christianity. Others, like historian Warwick Ball, view Zosimus' evident distaste for Philip as noteworthy, and suggest that Zosimus' anti-Christian polemic is indirect in his writing on the emperor. Shahîd construes Zosimus' silence as an argument for Philip's Christianity. Zosimus, he argues, would never have shown such distaste for a pagan. Septimius Severus was a [...] "barbarian", an African born at Leptis Magna whose mother tongue was Phoenician and whose wife, Julia Domna, was a provincial from Emesa. But Severus gets a good press from Zosimus (1.8). Nor would Philip's assistance in the execution of Gordian be enough: the 3rd century was hardly a stranger to such bloodshed and treachery. Zosimus' hostility begins to makes sense, Shahîd contends, once we assume that {{he was aware of}} the tradition that viewed Philip as the first Christian emperor (and perhaps even accepted it). And it becomes perfectly clear once <b>we</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> importance Zosimus attributes to the Secular Games, and the schematic incongruity he would behold when a Christian emperor was presiding over them.|$|E

He states quite clearly that without reason <b>we</b> cannot <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> essential truths of Scripture. Reason, however, is not a mere human invention.

500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. <b>We</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E

[...] The radio contact allowed the International community to pinpoint the location of the vessel. The Israelis were able to provide information about Abba's radio discussions with the ship to the Reagan administration and notified them that it was Abbas' faction behind the hijacking. Fearing that the terrorists threat to kill passengers had been followed through, and not wanting a repeat of the TWA Flight 847 terrorist incident where the administration looked impotent to act, the American special forces staged in Cyprus were ordered to make preparations to storm the vessel.|$|E

2500|$|Electromagnetic waves (such as light), {{traveling}} in free space or another homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, are properly described as transverse waves, meaning that a plane wave's {{electric field vector}} E and magnetic field H are in directions perpendicular to (or [...] "transverse" [...] to) the direction of wave propagation; E and H are also perpendicular to each other. Considering a monochromatic plane wave of optical frequency f (light of vacuum wavelength λ has a frequency of f = c/λ where c is the speed of light), let us take the direction of propagation as the z axis. Being a transverse wave the E and H fields must then contain components only in the x and y directions whereas Ez=Hz=0.
