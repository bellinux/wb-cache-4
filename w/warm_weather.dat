5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8:39p.m. in <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> and Stanford scored first, a touchdown, with its third {{offensive}} possession. Virginia Tech briefly {{took the lead}} with a defensive score and a touchdown of its own, but Stanford restored a 13-12 advantage before halftime. In the second half, Stanford pulled away from Virginia Tech as it scored 13 points {{in the third quarter}} and 14 in the fourth while holding the Hokies scoreless.|$|E
5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in {{economic}} terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E

5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested {{that there may have been}} only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{portions}} of the Great Lakes were hit by a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over {{portions of}} central New York. Several areas received over 115inches (over 2.5m) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1meter (3.3ft) of snow east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 31, 1986 and concluded on June 20, 1986, {{on a budget}} of $18 million. Filming began in Eldridge Street, Manhattan, New York City, which acted as Harry Angel's neighbourhood. Production designer Brian Morris and the set decorating team spent two months designing the set prior to filming, hoping to recreate 1950s New York. Because of the <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, ice trucks were used to create fake snow. Filming then moved to Alphabet City in Manhattan, where several bar scenes and Angel's intimate bedroom scene with Connie (Whitcraft) were filmed.|$|E

5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H may represent high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively <b>warm</b> <b>weather.</b> An L, {{on the other}} hand, may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian city of Innsbruck was {{the host}} in 1964. Although Innsbruck was a {{traditional}} winter sports resort, <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> caused {{a lack of}} snow during the Games and the Austrian army was asked to transport snow and ice to the sport venues. Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by sweeping all four speed-skating events. Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes. Luge was first contested in 1964, although the sport received bad publicity when a competitor {{was killed in a}} pre-Olympic training run.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic program {{remained}} {{similar to}} previous Winter Olympics, {{with only a}} few exceptions: neither skeleton nor military patrol events were held; curling, which had appeared in the first Winter Olympic Games, was a non-medal demonstration sport in 1932, as were a sled dog race and women's speed skating. Both men and women competed in these Games, although the only medal events women contested were the ladies' singles and pairs in figure skating. <b>Warm</b> <b>weather</b> forced officials to hold the four-man bobsleigh competition two days after the closing ceremonies, which had been conducted on February 13.|$|E

Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his good performance, setting a time of 1:26.029. Coulthard was the second-fastest driver. Montoya was third, two-tenths of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four fastest drivers. After {{the end of the}} warm-up but before the race, a second minute of silence was held {{at the end of the}} Drivers' Parade.|$|E
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in dry and <b>warm</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Both Ferrari drivers {{maintained}} their good performance from qualifying; Barrichello had the fastest time of 1:22.251. Michael Schumacher set the second fastest time. Ralf Schumacher recorded the third fastest time with Coulthard rounding out the top four. The session was disrupted by an incident which involved de la Rosa when he struck the barriers at turn 12 – the session was prematurely ended as marshals were required to clear the track – and Herbert clipped the tyre barrier at turn 14 after spinning on oil on the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8:47p.m. Eastern Standard Time in <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> and Cincinnati scored first, {{converting}} the game's opening possession into a touchdown and a 7–0 {{lead in the}} first quarter. Virginia Tech responded in the second quarter, tying the game at seven before taking a 10–7 lead with a field goal as time expired in the first half. In the third quarter, the two teams battled defensively, with only the Hokies able to score any points as Tech extended its lead to 13–7. During the final quarter, Virginia Tech scored its second touchdown of the game, giving the Hokies a 20–7 lead that lasted until time expired.|$|E
5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or <b>warm</b> <b>weather,</b> the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{to a greater or}} lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
