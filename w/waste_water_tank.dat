A cadeia produtiva do frango de corte gera uma variedade e quantidade considerÃvel de resÃduos com as mais distintas caracterÃsticas. No caso dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio, tem-se um volume considerÃvel de {{material}} produzido, com grande potencial poluidor. Considerando a problemÃtica este projeto teve por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade de aproveitamento dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio por meio da co-digestÃo anaerÃbia. Para o ensaio de co-digestÃo foi utilizada uma bateria de 20 biodigestores, confeccionados com tubos de PVC, com capacidade para aproximadamente 60 L cada, simulando um biodigestor tubular horizontal. Os resÃduos foram cedidos pela Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata â Copacol e sÃo provenientes das unidades de CafelÃndia â PR (Abate de aves), Nova Aurora â PR (IncubatÃrio de Aves) e Formosa â PR (Unidade Produtora de LeitÃes â UPL). Cinco misturas foram avaliadas, sendo elas: Tratamento 1 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua do tanque de equalizaÃÃo da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 2 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 3 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio. Tratamento 4 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Tratamento 5 (Misto) : ResÃduos de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Cada mistura compÃs um tratamento, o qual foi repetido quatro vezes. Todas as misturas foram processadas em liquidificador. As diferentes misturas foram calculadas de maneira a obter um substrato com 4 % de sÃlidos totais no inÃcio do processo - fase batelada, e com 2 % de sÃlidos totais para fase contÃnua. AlÃm dos materiais avaliados, todos os tratamentos receberam uma porcentagem de 15 % de inÃculo (resÃduo de gado de corte) na fase batelada e fase de adaptaÃÃo do sistema na alimentaÃÃo contÃnua. Primeiramente foi realizado o ensaio em batelada, o que possibilitou definir o ponto de queima do biogÃs nos diferentes tratamentos, bem como a curva de produÃÃo de gÃs, definindo assim, o tempo de retenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TRH) do substrato nos biodigestores. Para a fase contÃnua os biodigestores foram descarregados no final da fase batelada onde o efluente foi peneirado. ApÃs a fraÃÃo lÃquida foi novamente disposta nos biodigestores. A partir desta fase iniciouse o abastecimento continuo onde durante um mÃs os biodigestores alÃm de sua carga diÃria tambÃm receberam uma porcentagem de inÃculo para que houvesse uma adaptaÃÃo do sistema. As anÃlises de caracterizaÃÃo foram realizadas no afluente e efluente dos biodigestores na fase batelada, nos resÃduos separadamente, no afluente e efluente da fase contÃnua como tambÃm no resÃduo retido no biodigestor apÃs fase de abastecimento contÃnuo. Foram utilizadas metodologias especÃficas para as anÃlises, tais como: ST, SV, carbono orgÃnico total, nitrogÃnio (NTK), minerais, pH, condutividade elÃtrica, DQO, bem como o potencial mÃdio de produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano, porcentagem de metano e diÃxido de carbono no mesmo. T 4 apresentou os melhores desempenhos em produÃÃo de biogÃs. Maiores porcentagens de CH 4 na fase batelada foram apresentadas pelo tratamento T 2. Para fase contÃnua as maiores porcentagens foram apresentadas pelos tratamentos T 2, T 4 e T 5. A maior reduÃÃo nos valores de DQO foi observada no tratamento contendo Ãgua residuÃria da lagoa anaerÃbia do frigorifico - T 2. A concentraÃÃo de minerais no efluente dos biodigestores, para todos os tratamentos, agregou ao biofertilizante valor agronÃmico. The {{growth of}} the poultry sector, both to supply the internal market and for export, has moved the Brazilian agribusiness. The productive chain of the broiler generates a considerable variety and quantity of waste with the most distinct characteristics. In the case of hatchery waste, has been a considerable volume of material produced, with high pollution potential. Considering the problems this project aimed to study the feasibility of use of hatchery waste by anaerobic co-digestion. To test the co-digestion was used a battery of 20 digesters made with PVC pipes, with a capacity of about 60 L each, simulating a horizontal tubular digester. The wastes were disposed of by Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata - Copacol and are from the units of CafelÃndia - PR (Slaughter of poultry), Nova Aurora - PR (Poultry Hatchery) and Formosa - PR (Unit Production of Piglets - UPL). Five mixtures were evaluated, as follows: Treatment 1 : Residue hatchery drained + <b>Waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> agribusiness. Treatment 2 : Residue hatchery drained + water from the first anaerobic pond agribusiness. Treatment 3 : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery. Treatment 4 : Residue hatchery fresh + swine wastewater. Treatment 5 (Mixed) : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery + swine wastewater. Each composed a mixture treatment, which was repeated four times. All blends were processed in the blender. The different mixtures were calculated to obtain a substrate with 4 % total solids early in the process - batch phase, and 2 % total solids for solid phase. Besides the materials evaluated, all treatments received a percentage of 15 % of inoculum (cattle waste) during batch and adaptation phase of the system in continuous feeding. First test was performed in batch, {{making it possible to}} define the point of burning the biogas in the different treatments, and the curve of gas production, thus setting the hydraulic retention time (TRH) substrate in the digesters. For the continuous phase digesters were unloaded {{at the end of the}} batch phase where the effluent was screened. After, the liquid fraction was again prepared in the digesters. From this phase, began one where supplies still over a month the digesters beyond their daily load also received a percentage of inoculum for there was an adaptation of the system. Analyses were performed to characterize the influent and effluent of the digesters in the batch phase, the waste separately, in the influent and effluent of the continuous phase as well in residue retained in the digester after stage continuous water supply. Specific methodologies were used for analysis, such as: ST, SV, total organic carbon, nitrogen (TKN), minerals, pH, conductivity, COD, and the average potential of biogas production and methane content of methane and carbon dioxide carbon in it. T 4 showed the best performance in biogas production. Higher percentages of CH 4 in the batch phase were presented by the T 2. For the continuous phase, the highest percentages were presented by the T 2, T 4 and T 5.

Due to the ever increasing demand for potable and irrigation water and inadequacy of available surface water, the importance of groundwater is increasing exponentially every day (World Bank 2010; Selvam and Sivasubramanian 2012). Groundwater remains the only drinking water source in most of Indian rural household.

These induced negative consequences to the environment including eutrophication of aquatic water bodies, toxicity to marine life and depletion of phosphate resources. Reactive filter technology is developed based on the need to remove and retain nutrients from <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> while improving the quality of effluents from emission sources. Reactive filter materials are used to build filter bed systems that treats domestic <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> storm water, landfill leachates and contaminated subsurface water to the desired quality. In the past natural minerals such as zeolites and industrially produced polonite had been subject to laboratory study for the sorption of ammonium, heavy metals and phosphorous. The following paper is {{based on the results of}} experiment consisting of two columns packed with mordenite and polonite reactive materials filtering in series to reduce NH 4 and PO 4 content of a <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> Septic <b>tank</b> effluent pre filtered using 0. 45 μm filter is used as influent <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> into the dual columns. The dual column filtered a total of 24. 07 l s (372 PV) and 23. 42 ls (496 PV) of the <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> Sampling of the feed water and filtrates of both columns were done every second day with measurement of pH, conductivity and temperature. Analyzed samples confirmed that the dual column filtration resulted in re-moval efficiency of 84. 39 % (PO 4), 67. 98 % (NH 4) and - 37. 762. 8 % (NOx). Filtration in the first (mordenite) column resulted in relatively larger proportion of the influent ammonium ion exchange than sorption of phosphate while the filtration in the second (polonite) column sorbed quite high amount of phosphorous than ammonium from effluent of the first column. Saturation of mordenite occurred faster even though there was sorption potential for few more of influent ammonium. All PO 4 removal in mordenite column occurred above breakthrough condition. Polonite packed column was in a condition of a third of it’s saturation potential for PO 4 removal at the end of the experiment. pH of samples was the parameter which is correlated significantly with filtration in polonite column than temperature and electrical conductivity. The performance of polonite was higher at higher pH than at lower pH. The mean concentrations of the dual column effluent were 0. 77 mg-PO 4 /l and 11. 13 mg-NH 4 /l. This is acceptable by the standards of environmental laws. The result of the experiment is valuable in prediction of performance and designing of real time filter bed...|$|R

50|$|Water is {{supplied}} to the HAB via a potable <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> located 100 ft {{away in the}} Engineering Support Equipment Area. The tank is a plastic storage container with a 450 gal capacity (8 days worth of water at 6 gal per person per day). Water must be manually carried or pumped via a hose from the potable <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> to the HAB's internal tank, which holds about 60 gal. The water is then gravity fed into a pressure pump that distributes the fresh water {{to the rest of}} the HAB, including a water heater. The water used to flush toilet is greywater. This is <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> that has run down the sink and shower drains in the HAB and then through the greywater system out of the GreenHab. Water is rationed and monitored to minimize inefficiency and waste in the system.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{issued the}} second phase of the organic air {{emission}} standards for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) and hazardous waste generators in December 1994. These standards (referred to as the Subpart CC standards) are designed to further reduce organic air emissions from hazardous waste management activities. To comply with these new air standards, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is designing a volatile organic removal and destruction treatment train to modify its existing <b>Waste</b> <b>Water</b> Treatment <b>Tank</b> Farm (hereafter called Tank Farm). LLNL`s Tank Farm consists of six, 7, 000 -L open-top tanks used to store and treat aqueous low-level radioactive, mixed, and hazardous waste before discharging it to the local publicly owned treatment works. The waste stored and treated in the tanks have elevated volatile organic constituent (VOC) concentrations. According to the Subpart CC standards, tanks handling waste with similar VOC concentrations must be retrofitted with a cover and an emission control device for cover openings that achieves at least a 95 % reduction in the total organic content of the vented gas stream. However, LLNL concluded that the removal and destruction of VOCs from waste before they enter the Tank Farm would demonstrate compliance with the Subpart CC standards more effectively and be more cost effective than installation of air emission control devices on the Tank Farm. LLNL has designed this removal and destruction technique to consist of an air stripper, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, catalytic oxidizer, scrubber, and mist eliminator...|$|R
