25|$|A {{few years}} after the {{declaration}} of the area as site for settlement and agricultural development, World War II broke out and the region was later placed under Japanese control, Although the extent of damage on properties {{and the number of}} lives lost during the war <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to other areas in the Philippines, early settlers of the region had difficulty rebuilding their lives after the war for they were not spared from the wrath inflicted by the members of the Kalinga tribes from the north.|$|E
25|$|Xuanzang left Adinapur, {{which had}} few Buddhist monks, but many stupas and monasteries. His travels included, passing through Hunza and the Khyber Pass to the east, {{reaching}} the former capital of Gandhara, Purushapura (Peshawar), {{on the other}} side. Peshawar <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to its former glory, and Buddhism was declining in the region. Xuanzang visited a number of stupas around Peshawar, notably the Kanishka Stupa. This stupa was built just southeast of Peshawar, by a former king of the city. In 1908, it was rediscovered by D.B. Spooner {{with the help of}} Xuanzang's account.|$|E
25|$|From Italy Fregoli went to Brazil, Spain, and the United States. While {{he was in}} Madrid he was {{watched in}} {{performance}} by Alfred Moul, {{the general manager of}} the Alhambra Theatre in London's Charing Cross Road (which was being refitted at that time in the Moorish style {{under the direction of the}} great designer Owen Jones). Moul had heard of Fregoli's genius and wanted to be the first impresario in Britain to sign him up. He subsequently claimed that Fregoli (and his team of supporting assistants) were being paid £350 per week to perform at the Alhambra—a remarkable amount for the time. This <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to what Fregoli was to generate in ticket sales.|$|E

500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we {{want to be in the}} car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which {{were sold to}} the general public was extremely effective. A good example was The physical basis of life, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme— that vital action is nothing more than [...] "the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it"— shocked the audience, though that <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said [...] "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1972, Gaudron {{had entered}} a {{bar with a}} male {{barrister}} friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women. Gaudron [...] "patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn't want a woman because he'd brought his own," [...] eventually creating [...] "something of a scene" [...] which {{attracted the attention of}} Labor politician Clyde Cameron, who said that he didn't realise such sexual discrimination still existed. Gaudron said that [...] "the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became Minister for Industrial Relations after the next election." [...] However, the Whitlam government was elected on 2 December, and Cameron duly became Minister for Industrial Relations. Whitlam called Gaudron on 3 December to hire her to argue the case.|$|E

60|$|But now Captain Moore {{found himself}} attacked, {{and as he}} went over into the brook he {{realized}} {{that he was in the}} most perilous position he had yet encountered. Facing Indians and desperadoes <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to facing this beast, that seemed bent upon his destruction.|$|E
60|$|Angry and stiff, {{she went}} through her last term. She would rather be out again earning her own living. Even Brinsley Street and Mr. Harby seemed real in comparison. Her violent hatred of the Ilkeston School <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with the sterile {{degradation}} of college. But {{she was not going}} back to Brinsley Street either. She would take her B.A., and become a mistress in some Grammar School for a time.|$|E
5000|$|At another store, the {{customers}} and employees discuss the recent massacre, {{with the owner}} saying that it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to {{what he would do}} to the Convenience Store Killer. Morty appears, and asks, [...] "Oh yeah? What do you have in mind?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese idiom yi nuo qian jin (...) , {{which is}} used to {{describe}} a situation where a promise is kept, was derived from a saying about Ji Bu: [...] "a hundred jin of gold <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to a promise from Ji Bu".|$|R
60|$|Dale's {{struggle}} ended {{there when}} he faced his soul. To understand himself was {{to be released from}} strain, worry, ceaseless importuning doubt and wonder and fear. But the fever of unrest, of uncertainty, had <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to a sudden upflashing torment of love.|$|R
60|$|But {{the effect}} that her mother's precautionary {{disposition}} had had upon her <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to that produced by the words of La Fleur. For {{the first time she}} looked upon Ralph as one on whom other persons looked as her lover, and to sit {{by the side of the}} said young man, immediately after being informed of said fact, was not conducive to a free and tranquil flow of remark.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} cry of rage and vengeance which rose from the Prussians as they passed their dead comrade, and I could not but smile as I {{wondered}} what they could think of the Emperor as a horseman and a swordsman. I glanced back cautiously as before, and I saw {{that none of the}} seven men stopped. The fate of their comrade <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the carrying out of their mission.|$|E
6000|$|After {{this came}} the shoulder-pad, {{and then the}} thick dress itself was drawn on, and the attendants hitched it up with {{difficulty}} over his spreading shoulders, {{but they could not}} hitch up an idea along with it. The forcing of his hands through the tight india-rubber wrists of the sleeves was done with tremendous power, but it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with the energy he put forth to force himself through his mental difficulty-- yet all in vain! The outside stockings and the canvas [...] "overalls" [...] followed, and he finally put on the red night-cap, which seemed to extinguish all capacity for thought.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who know}} history {{know that the}} Yugoslav idea has no dynamics. It <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the mighty Croatian idea. In Croatia, the Yugoslav idea is a shallow {{wreckage}} under which the Croatian national volcano boils; only a subtle push is necessary to make it erupt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can he? If he cannot," [...] {{shouted the}} youth, [...] "if he cannot, who can? Greene, and Heath, and young Hamilton <b>are</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to this Harper.

60|$|He laughed, as Dante {{has told}} us that the devils laugh {{at the sight of the}} torture of the damned. Marguerite had thought that by now she had lived through the whole gamut of horror and anguish that human heart could bear; yet now, when Desgas left the house, and she {{remained}} alone in this lonely, squalid room, with that fiend for company, she felt as if all that she had suffered <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with this. He continued to laugh and chuckle to himself for awhile, rubbing his hands together in anticipation of his triumph.|$|E
60|$|The Prince's grief at {{the death}} of his mother was great, but it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to that of the King, his father, who was quite inconsolable for the loss of his dear wife. Neither time nor reason seemed to lighten his sorrow, and the sight of all the {{familiar}} faces and things about him only served to remind him of his loss. He therefore resolved to travel for change, and by means of his magic art was able to visit every country he came to see under different shapes, returning every few weeks to the place where he had left a few followers.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} bitter words of Knolles, the more bitter because Nigel felt {{in his heart}} that he had indeed done wrong, and that Chandos would have said the same though, perchance, in kinder words. He listened in silent respect, as his duty was, and then having saluted his leader he withdrew apart, threw himself down amongst the bushes, and wept the hottest tears of his life, sobbing bitterly with his face between his hands. He had striven hard, and yet {{everything}} had gone wrong with him. He was bruised, burned and aching from head to foot. Yet so high is the spirit above the body that all <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the sorrow and shame which racked his soul.|$|E

6000|$|Long as he {{had been}} {{desiring}} it, however, Kate thought it must have <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with the time that elapsed ere he said anything else; so she bent over a flower which she held in her hand, and said in a low voice, [...] "Indeed, Harry; what is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hindbad drew near, {{and kissing}} his hand respectfully, replied, [...] "Sir, you have indeed known fearful perils; my {{troubles}} have <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to yours.

60|$|To {{concentrate}} on Elspeth {{so that he}} might find out what was in her mind was, as we have seen, seldom necessary to Tommy; for he had learned her by heart long ago. Yet a time was now come when he had to concentrate, and even then he was doubtful of the result. So often he had put that mind of hers to rights that it was an open box to him, or had been until he conceived the odd notion that perhaps it contained a secret drawer. This would have been resented by most brothers, but Tommy's chagrin <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the exhilaration with which he perceived that he might be about to discover something new about woman. He was like the digger whose hand is on the point of closing on a diamond--a certain holiness added.|$|E
60|$|But {{the coarse}} violent contradiction which Sir William {{had given me}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with the reproach {{conveyed}} in Miss Weston's countenance. She {{looked at me as}} though all her anger were now turned against me. And yet, methought, there was more of sorrow than of resentment in her countenance. But what cause was there for either? Why should I be reproached, even by her look? She did not remember at the moment that when I answered her chance question as to my domestic affairs, I had answered it as to a man who was a stranger to me, and not as to a beautiful woman, with whom I was about to pass certain days in close and intimate society. To her, at the moment, it seemed as though I had cruelly deceived her. In truth, the one person really deceived had been myself.|$|E
60|$|Notable as my {{reception}} {{had been}} (under that unfortunate mistake of Mrs. Ponto that I {{was related to}} Lord Snobbington, which I was not permitted to correct), it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> to the bowing and kotooing, the raptures and flurry which preceded and welcomed the visit of a real live lord and lord's son, a brother officer of Cornet Wellesley Ponto, in the 120th Hussars, who came over with the young Cornet from Guttlebury, where their distinguished regiment was quartered. This was my Lord Gules, Lord Saltire's grandson and heir: a very young, short, sandy-haired and tobacco-smoking nobleman, who cannot have left the nursery very long, and who, though he accepted the honest Major's invitation to the Evergreens in a letter written in a school-boy handwriting, {{with a number of}} faults of spelling, may yet be a very fine classical scholar for what I know: having had his education at Eton, where he and young Ponto were inseparable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, darling, {{how could}} I? Planting Breitstein {{on the club}} would have <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> with sowing these horrors about London.

50|$|But {{his task}} though {{has nothing to}} do with the inhabitants, but to do with the {{elemental}} in the heart of the mountain at the lonely peaks, surrounded by a glacier of epic proportions.

6000|$|... "She {{would be}} a wretch else.

Mamerzelle can sleep such a night as this, which I'm sure she could not do were she as much {{concerned}} for you as I am." ...|$|R
