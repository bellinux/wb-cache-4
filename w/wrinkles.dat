40|$|AbstractInner flange {{and side}} <b>wrinkling</b> often occur in rotary-draw bending process of {{rectangular}} aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes, {{and the distribution}} and magnitude of <b>wrinkling</b> is related to geometrical parameters of the tubes. In order to {{study the effects of}} geometrical parameters on <b>wrinkling</b> of rectangular wave-guide tubes, a 3 D-FE model for rotary-draw bending processes of thin-walled rectangular aluminum alloy wave-guide tubes was built based on the platform of ABAQUS/Explicit, and its reliability was validated by experiments. Simulation and analysis of the influence laws of geometrical parameters on the wave heights of inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> were then carried out. The results show that inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> is the main <b>wrinkling</b> way to rectangular wave-guide tubes in rotary-draw bending processes, but side <b>wrinkling</b> cannot be neglected because side <b>wrinkling</b> is 2 / 3 of inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> when b and h are smaller. Inner flange and side <b>wrinkling</b> increase with increasing b and h; the influence of b on side <b>wrinkling</b> is larger than that of h, while both b and h affect inner flange <b>wrinkling</b> greatly.

40|$|Thin-film {{membranes}} {{are basic}} elements {{of a variety of}} space inflatable/deployable structures. <b>Wrinkling</b> degrades the performance and reliability of these membrane structures, and hence has been a topic of continued interest. <b>Wrinkling</b> analysis of membranes for general geometry and arbitrary boundary conditions is quite challenging. The objective of this presentation is two-fold. Firstly, the existing models of <b>wrinkled</b> membranes and related numerical solution methods are reviewed. The important issues to be discussed are the capability of a membrane model to characterize taut, <b>wrinkled</b> and slack states of membranes in a consistent and physically reasonable manner; the ability of a <b>wrinkling</b> analysis method to predict the formation and growth of <b>wrinkled</b> regions, and to determine out-of-plane deformation and <b>wrinkled</b> waves; the convergence of a numerical solution method for <b>wrinkling</b> analysis; and the compatibility of a <b>wrinkling</b> analysis with general-purpose finite element codes. According to this review, several opening issues in modeling and analysis of <b>wrinkled</b> membranes that are to be addressed in future research are summarized, The second objective of this presentation is to discuss a newly developed membrane model of two viable parameters (2 -VP model) and associated parametric finite element method (PFEM) for <b>wrinkling</b> analysis are introduced. The innovations and advantages of the proposed membrane model and PFEM-based <b>wrinkling</b> analysis are: (1) Via a unified stress-strain relation; the 2 -VP model treat the taut, <b>wrinkled,</b> and slack states of membranes consistently; (2) The PFEM-based <b>wrinkling</b> analysis has guaranteed convergence; (3) The 2 -VP model along with PFEM is capable of predicting membrane out-of-plane deformations; and (4) The PFEM can be integrated into any existing finite element code. Preliminary numerical examples are also included in this presentation to demonstrate the 2 -VP model and PFEM-based <b>wrinkling</b> analysis approach...|$|R

5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface <b>wrinkles,</b> darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wrinkling</b> {{occurs when}} a blank is {{subjected}} to compressive stresses during the forming process as in the flange of a cup during drawing. Although the failure limit due to plastic flow localization can be simply defined by the FLC at each point of a continuum, the <b>wrinkling</b> limit cannot be defined with simple variables such as strain, stress, and thickness. <b>Wrinkling</b> is strongly affected by the mechanical properties of the sheet material, the geometry of the tools and blank, and contact conditions. The analysis of <b>wrinkling</b> initiation and growth is, therefore, difficult to perform due to the complex synergistic effects of the controlling parameters. Because of these difficulties, the study of <b>wrinkling</b> has generally been conducted case by case. A unique <b>wrinkling</b> criterion, {{which could be used}} effectively for various sheet forming processes, has not yet been proposed. There were many investigations on the effect of process parameters (BHF and friction) and geometry on <b>wrinkling.</b> However, there are few reported results on the influence of the material model on <b>wrinkling.</b> This paper shows how strain hardening and r-values affect <b>wrinkle</b> formation in its magnitude, initiation, and direction through the NUMISHEET 2014 benchmark test for <b>wrinkling</b> during cup drawing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Tilt table testing mainly {{evaluates the}} {{systemic}} cardiovascular {{part of the}} autonomic nervous system, while {{it is assumed that}} the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test assesses the peripheral part of the autonomic nervous system. In this study we explored whether the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test could be a useful test for autonomic dysfunction and whether the clinical evaluation of <b>wrinkling</b> can be improved by digital analysis of photographs. Methods: As much as 20 healthy subjects and 15 patients underwent tilt table testing and finger <b>wrinkling</b> testing. During the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test the right hand was immersed in water at 40 °C. The degree of <b>wrinkling</b> was assessed with a 5 -point clinical scale at baseline, 5, 15 and 30 min of immersion. Photographs were taken at the same intervals. Several features were evaluated using digital analysis: length and gradient of automatically detected <b>wrinkle</b> and mean, maximum, minimum, variance and derivative of grey value of pixels. Results: Clinical scoring of <b>wrinkling</b> allowed differentiation between healthy subjects and patients with a normal and an abnormal response to tilt table testing. Relevant features obtained with digital analysis were mean grey value and the gradient of automatically detected <b>wrinkle.</b> McNemar’s test showed no difference in test results between the tilt table test and the finger <b>wrinkling</b> test with a kappa of 0. 68. Conclusion: The finger <b>wrinkling</b> test {{can be used as a}} screening test before tilt table testing.

40|$|AbstractA new Modified Displacement Component (MDC) {{method is}} {{proposed}} to accurately predict <b>wrinkling</b> characteristics in the membrane {{by eliminating the}} singularity of the displacement solution. In MDC method, a singular displacement component is primarily obtained at the <b>wrinkling</b> point by introducing the first-order characteristic vector multiplied by a positive intermediate parameter in the singular stiffness matrix. The non-singularity displacement solution is then obtained by modifying the singular displacement component based on three equality relationships at the <b>wrinkling</b> point. Where, the accurate introduction and the timely removal of the critical <b>wrinkling</b> mode are two key steps. In our simulation, we use a direct perturbed method to accurately consider these two key steps. In the direct perturbed method, some small, quantitative, out-of-plane forces are applied onto the membrane surface directly based on the first <b>wrinkling</b> mode, and then removed immediately after <b>wrinkling</b> starts. Several effective strategies are then used to advance the convergence. A <b>wrinkling</b> test using photogrammetry is used to verify the validity of our method.

Many ichthyosaur dentitions are heterodont, combining several tooth shapes, e.g. small {{teeth in the}} front and larger teeth at the rear. The teeth are usually placed in tooth sockets; derived species possess a common tooth groove. In the latter case, adult individuals sometimes become toothless.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a nonlinear mathematical model for evolution of <b>wrinkle</b> patterns of an anisotropic crystal film on a viscoelastic substrate layer. The underlying mechanism of <b>wrinkling</b> has been generally {{understood as a}} stress-driven instability. Previously, theoretical studies on <b>wrinkling</b> have assumed isotropic elastic properties for the film. Motivated by recent experimental observations of ordered <b>wrinkle</b> patterns in single-crystal thin films, this paper develops a theoretical model coupling anisotropic elastic deformation of a crystal film with viscoelastic deformation of a thin substrate layer. A linear perturbation analysis is performed to predict onset of the <b>wrinkling</b> instability and the initial evolution kinetics; an energy minimization method is adopted to analyze <b>wrinkle</b> patterns at the equilibrium states. For a cubic crystal film under an equi-biaxial compression, orthogonally ordered <b>wrinkle</b> patterns are predicted at both the initial stage and the equilibrium state. This is confirmed by numerical simulations of evolving <b>wrinkle</b> patterns. By varying the residual stresses in the film, numerical simulations show {{that a variety of}} <b>wrinkle</b> patterns (e. g., orthogonal, parallel, zigzag, and checkerboard patterns) emerge {{as a result of the}} competition between the material anisotropy and the stress anisotropy...|$|R

To address this, a <b>wrinkling</b> wave function was developed by considering their shear bend deformation characteristics. Based on this wave function and the thin shell theory, an energy prediction model for this type of <b>wrinkling</b> was established. This model enables consideration of the effects of shear deformation zone ranges, material parameters, loading modes, and friction coefficients between tube and dies on the minimum <b>wrinkling</b> energy. Tube <b>wrinkling</b> sensitive zones (WSZs) can be revealed by combining this <b>wrinkling</b> prediction model with a thermal-mechanical coupled finite element model for simulating these bending processes. The reliability of this <b>wrinkling</b> prediction model was verified, and an investigation into the tube <b>wrinkling</b> characteristics was carried out based on the experimental conditions. This found that the WSZs are located on either a single side or both sides of the maximum shear stress zone. When the friction coefficients between the tube and the various dies coincide, the WSZs are located on both sides. The larger the value of the tube inner corner radius and/or the smaller the value of the outer corner radius, the smaller the <b>wrinkling</b> probability. With an increase {{in the value of the}} moving die displacement, the <b>wrinkling</b> probability increases at first, and then decreases...|$|R
