50|$|Most of the hill, {{both the}} open moorland and the {{afforested}} parts, is recorded as open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 thereby giving largely unfettered access to walkers.

A few public rights of <b>way</b> <b>cross</b> through the forest, though some are difficult to access. Much of the bridleway between Ffrwd Uchaf and Pen-twyn-isaf serves as a forest track and provides ready access from Cwm Taf, as does the footpath which carries the Taff Trail between the same locations.|$|E

The region also boasts an extensive network of recreational trails (jogging, biking, equestrian, etc.). While many connections are already in place, construction continues and will link all of the trails and greenways. Major trails include the Cady <b>Way,</b> <b>Cross</b> Seminole and West Orange Trails.|$|E

He wrote {{the film as}} a response to the [...] "preaching" [...] he found in other comedies [...] "which seemed to have abandoned the fun in favor of the message." [...] Sturges may have been influenced by the stories of John Garfield, who lived the life of a hobo, riding freight trains and hitchhiking his <b>way</b> <b>cross</b> country for a short period in the 1930s. Sturges wrote the film with Joel McCrea in mind, but found the female lead through the casting process. Barbara Stanwyck was considered, as well as Frances Farmer.|$|E
50|$|Minor roads ascend {{the slopes}} of the hill from Ferndale, Ynysybwl and Pontypridd {{converging}} at the elevated hamlet of Llanwonno. Various other public rights of <b>way</b> <b>cross</b> the hill though none reaches its summit. Route 47 of the National Cycle Network runs the length of the hill on its eastern side ascending via the minor road from Pontypridd to Llanwonno and then continuing northwest on forest tracks to join the A4233 above Maerdy. Those areas of forestry in the ownership of Natural Resources Wales (successor to Forestry Commission Wales in 2013) are open to public access, as are some areas of open moorland by virtue of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E
50|$|Two {{or three}} similar stages are stacked {{side by side}} and burn in parallel. Using crossfeed, the fuel tanks of the orbital stage are kept full, while the tank(s) in the booster stage(s) are used to run engines in the booster stage(s) and orbital stage. Once the {{boosters}} run dry, they are ejected, and (typically) glide back to a landing. The advantage to {{this is that the}} mass ratios of the individual stages are vastly reduced due to the <b>way</b> <b>cross</b> feed modifies the rocket equation. Isp*g*ln(2MR^2/MR+1) & Isp*g*ln(3MR^2/MR+2) respectively. With hydrogen engines, a triamese only needs an MR of 5, as opposed to an MR of 10 for a single-stage equivalent vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The Dorchester Road ran south-eastwards from Ilchester, {{following}} {{the line of}} the present-day A37 through Yeovil. Another road ran westwards along the Polden Hills to Crandon Bridge near the mouth of the River Parrett, a district important at the time for its salt production. The Fosse <b>Way</b> was <b>crossed</b> at Beacon Hill north of Shepton Mallet by a road that linked lead and silver mines at Charterhouse with a harbour at Southampton. Hot springs were discovered near where the Fosse <b>Way</b> <b>crossed</b> the River Avon and the town of Aquae Sulis (now the city of Bath) developed there. Just a little further north the Fosse <b>Way</b> <b>crossed</b> a long road between London and Sea Mills.|$|R
