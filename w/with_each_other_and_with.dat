5|$|Domestic cats, {{especially}} young kittens, {{are known for}} their love of play. This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. Cats also engage in play fighting, <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. It was hoped that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E

The first European {{to explore the}} region from overland was Simon Fraser, who travelled down the Fraser River in 1808 (it was later named for him). The Hudson's Bay Company established trading posts at Fort Langley (in 1827) and Fort Yale (1848). Their involvement in trading with the British brought great changes to the relationships of the Stó:lō <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> the land.|$|E

25|$|As mentioned, in a vector space, {{such as that}} {{modelling}} the spacetime {{of special}} relativity, tangent vectors can be canonically identified with vectors in the space itself, and vice versa. This means that the tangent spaces at each point are canonically identified <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> the vector space itself. This explains how the right hand side of the above equation can be employed directly, without regard to spacetime point the metric is to be evaluated and from where (which tangent space) the vectors come from.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} have studied inconsistencies in and between texts and canons {{as a means}} to study the bible and the societies that created and influenced it.
