5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|It {{would be}} a journey worthy of its own chapter of sternwheeler history and a fitting swan song for the pioneer steamer because, {{although}} it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> accomplishment, it was made too late.

In a 2009 interview she commented on {{the significance of the}} character to EastEnders and viewers, saying [...] "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I still get a lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> character with an epic storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|The rhythm {{tracks are}} {{performed}} by Grupo Cultural Olodum, a drumming collective ("bloco afro") directed by [...] "Neguinho do Samba" [...] (Alves de Souza) and also signed to Warner Bros. It, like many songs on The Rhythm of the Saints, was recorded {{live in the}} streets of Pelourinho Square of Salvador, Brazil in February 1988. Microphones were hung from windows or on telephone poles to capture the performances. According to Simon, [...] "Hundreds of people gathered. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> day — an amazing recording experience." [...] The vocal track was recorded at the Hit Factory in New York City.|$|E
500|$|The album reached #55 on the Japan Oricon charts.

On the other hand, one reviewer on Square Enix Music Online (unrelated to Square Enix) felt it did not represent Mitsuda's best album, saying that [...] "what <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> soundtrack in its day ... has [...] {{stood the test of}} time very well."

500|$|Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online {{reviewed}} the album as [...] "a sophisticated piano collection" [...] that was enjoyable to listen to, though {{he noted that}} the arrangements were [...] "straightforward" [...] rather than ambitious. Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version gave a similar review for the album; he felt that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> album that, while not as technically difficult or different enough from the source material for some listeners, was still very beautiful and well-arranged. Gann of RPGFan, however, felt disappointed by the album, calling the arrangements [...] "soul-less" [...] and full of [...] "needless grandiosity". He concluded that the original pieces were too rich and complex to translate well to solo piano arrangements, which left the works without substance as they did not deviate enough from the source material.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{recording}} Spiritual Machines, percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging while walking his dog. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)" [...] and [...] "Are You Sad?", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for. When the final tracks were ready for mixing, the band shopped around before finding a producer they wanted. The album was mixed in Atlanta, Georgia by Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam's long time producer. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> experience working with Brendan, someone who immediately understood {{what we were trying}} to do and was able to capture exactly how we heard this album," [...] noted Maida.|$|E
500|$|The game's storyline {{was written}} by Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton, who are all regular writers on The Simpsons. They wanted to create {{something}} that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, [...] "a great new game". Matt Groening and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its [...] "look and feel" [...] to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, said it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it The Simpsons Game and not add a subtitle was because they {{felt it was a}} restart of [...] "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".|$|E

Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called the scene [...] "utterly heartbreaking and lovely". He added, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> moment for Glee, capped {{off by the}} simple gesture of Burt grabbing his son's shoulder {{in an act of}} support. Mike O'Malley is completely Emmy-worthy. We've never seen a character like this before on television or seen such a relationship between a father and son." [...] Poniewozik wrote, [...] "Mike O'Malley, as always, made me believe that Burt was not speaking out of some false enlightenment but out of a desire to protect his family and a struggle to do the right thing." [...] BuddyTV's Henrik Batallones said O'Malley was [...] "the star of the show".|$|E

I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Trauma {{traveled}} to Los Angeles {{to perform at}} the Whisky a Go Go. Among those in attendance were James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, both members of Metallica, which had formed the previous year. Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, [...] "this amazing shredding" [...] (which later became [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth"), the two {{went in search of}} what they thought <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> guitar player. When they learned that what they had heard was a bass solo by Burton, they decided to recruit him for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was [...] "starting to get a little commercial", he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with him, and said he would join only if the band would relocate from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left their origin of Los Angeles to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco.|$|E

[...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by.

500|$|Gyllenhaal was Gilroy's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Lou. During pre-production, Gyllenhaal was going to star in another film, but that project fell through, {{allowing}} time to meet with Gilroy. The two discussed the script in Atlanta, where Gyllenhaal was filming Prisoners (2013). When Gilroy told Gyllenhaal that he wrote Nightcrawler as a success story, Gyllenhaal became interested in the film. [...] "This character was beautifully written. The dialogue is pretty extraordinary. Just even the style of the script <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> read", says Gyllenhaal. The two rehearsed the script months before filming began, and Gyllenhaal became heavily involved in production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. While rehearsing the character, Gilroy mentioned how he saw Lou as a coyote, a nocturnal predator who is driven by its never ending hunger. Gyllenhaal took this comment literally, and lost nearly thirty pounds by eating nothing but kale salads and chewing gum, and running fifteen miles every day. Although some of the crew disagreed with this decision, Gilroy was supportive of the weight loss; Gyllenhaal was respectful and did not alter the script, so Gilroy wanted to reciprocate this generosity.|$|E
500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>amazing</b> song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that." ...|$|E
