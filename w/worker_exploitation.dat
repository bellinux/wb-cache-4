[...] Melissa Bell of The Washington Post felt Banksy's titles had helped revive The Simpsons [...] "edge", but after [...] "the jarring opening, the show went back to its regular routine of guest cameos, self-referential jokes and tangential story lines." [...] Marlow Riley of MTV wrote [...] "as satire, [...] a bit over-the-top. What is shocking is that Fox ran Banksy's ballsy critique of outsourcing, The Simpsons, and the standards and human rights conditions that people in first world nations accept. It's uncomfortable and dark, and not what's expected from the modern Simpsons, which mainly consists of 'Homer hurts himself' jokes." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the link between restrictive immigration schemes, specifically ‘tied visas’ and the selective application of labour laws, with <b>exploitation</b> of <b>workers.</b> It focuses on the situation of migrant domestic workers, who accompany their employers to the United Kingdom (UK) and are exposed to both an excessively restrictive visa regime, introduced in April 2012, and limited labour protections. The immigration status of these workers is currently tied to a named employer, a restriction that traps workers into exploitative conditions, often amounting to forced labour, servitude or slavery. Additionally, current UK labour laws are either not enforced or not applicable to domestic workers. The article concludes that unless the current immigration regime is abolished and comprehensive labour law protections are extended to migrant domestic <b>workers,</b> <b>exploitation</b> will continue...|$|R

While on the surface California boasts affluence and glamour, its less obvious, but equally important, manufacturing industry runs rampant with immigrant <b>workers</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Can a dual-natured industry gain the respect and recognition it takes to be considered an international fashion capital?

40|$|Temporary labor visa {{rules in}} the United States are criticized on three grounds: for failing to {{allocate}} visas efficiently, for failing to adequately protect domestic workers, and for exposing migrant <b>workers</b> to <b>exploitation.</b> We {{argue that it is}} possible to address all three problems by re-configuring the property rights associated with the visas and carefully designing the mechanism for allocating those rights. Our core insight is to unbundle the two rights that today are typically combined: the firm’s right to employ a foreign worker, and the worker’s right to reside and work in the country during that time. A three-pronged approach— auctioning abstract pre-contract visas to firms, allowing their trade on a secondary market, and transferring the visa’s ownership to the worker upon signature of the employment contract—has the potential to improve the efficiency of visa allocation, to better shield domestic workers, and to protect foreign <b>workers</b> from <b>exploitation...</b>|$|R
