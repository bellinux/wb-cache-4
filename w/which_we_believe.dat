Others have seen {{it as a sign}} of God's judgement on the Jewish people, sometimes connecting it with the destruction of the city of Jerusalem in the year 70; or as symbolising shame, fear, or the mental suffering of Jesus. Fitzmyer compares the event to a contemporary description recorded in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, which recounts [...] "unlawful acts against the gods, from <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> the very sun turned away, as if it too were loath to look upon the foul deed".|$|E

Bernard Frank, a fellow forester, joined them later in the year; the men mailed an [...] "Invitation to Help Organize a Group to Preserve the American Wilderness" [...] to like-minded individuals. The invitation expressed their desire [...] "to integrate the growing sentiment <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> exists {{in this country for}} holding wild areas sound-proof as well as sight-proof from our increasingly mechanized life," [...] and their conviction that such wildernesses were [...] "a serious human need rather than a luxury and plaything".|$|E

He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

Chicoine could depose him and {{take control of the}} Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church as he did. Schuckardt formally excommunicated Chicoine on June 30, 1984. In the August 26 Spokesman Review article, Chicoine is quoted as saying: [...] "We contend {{that it is not a}} valid excommunication. If he is incompetent, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> we've proved, then his acts are null and void." [...] Chicoine died on August 10, 1995 and is buried at Mount Saint Michael.

2500|$|The Palestinians were {{represented}} by the Palestine Liberation Organization in negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords. They envisioned a 'permanent settlement based on Security Council Resolution 242'. The main premise of the Oslo Accords was the eventual creation of Palestinian autonomy in {{some or all of}} the territories captured during the Six-Day War, in return for Palestinian recognition of Israel. However, the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Nabil Shaath, said: [...] "Whether a state is announced now or after liberation, its borders must be those of 4 June 1967. We will not accept a state without borders or with borders based on UN Resolution 242, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> is no longer suitable.

It is hoped that the good offices of the United States may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up.

2500|$|Daniel Dennett {{argued that}} {{the way we think}} we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion.

According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing.|$|E

These three developments included the development at SDC of sophisticated time-sharing and data-management systems, the advances being made by the Library of Congress and others in formatting large data bases for storage on magnetic tape, and the advent of third-generation computer equipment, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> could accommodate the large files that would be required. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> that, together, these developments would make it possible for all types and sizes of libraries to use a large computer for their processing and housekeeping functions without changing their traditional patterns of operation or giving up the autonomy they now enjoy.

2500|$|Another dispute {{centers on}} {{funding of the}} Caskey School of Divinity. The Cason Foundation, which had donated $5 million to LC to fund the school, {{announced}} that it will no longer financially support the college because of [...] "actions of President Aguillard <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> to be unethical and potentially illegal." [...] Edgar D. Cason and his wife, Flora Jean Caskey Cason, of Coushatta in Red River Parish, who established the foundation, informed LC trustees by letter on April 15, 2013, that the foundation was terminating its ties to LC. A probe conducted by a law firm in New Orleans claims that Aguillard had improperly diverted nearly $60,000 in divinity school donations to LC projects in Tanzania, Africa. A committee of five LC board members, however, defended Aguillard and maintain that he did not act improperly regarding the funds. Cason, a wealthy timber operator, farmer, and cattleman, has supported conservative Republican candidates, including Santorum for President, and issues, such as the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. Cason questioned why the LC trustees did not permit him to address the board at its March meeting.|$|E

The bridge was densely lined with people, and the platform was well covered, though not inconveniently crowded. A profusion of banners were displayed on this elegant and substantial structure, and from nearly all the public and many of the private buildings both in Newcastle and Gateshead. The vessels in the river hoisted their flags mast-high on the occasion, and the church bells of the two towns rung many a merry peal in honour of the royal visit...

30|$|To our knowledge, {{there have}} been no {{previous}} studies of eye care and basic (i.e. standard) visual abilities amongst UK-based high-level sports players in the games of cricket or rugby league. This work represents a preliminary attempt to understand whether having optimal and/or superior vision is important for elite-level participation in these sports. Our sample size is modest which reduces the power of our statistical analyses. Having said this, groups of elites are by their very nature small because they represent the best of their sports, e.g. our cricketing elites were, at the time, more or less the entire Englandâ€™s ladies cricket squad. We did not gather equivalent data in a control group of non-sporting, age-matched individuals. Instead, we compared the results in our sports players with published results from young, optimally corrected, non-sporting adults. Thus, while these comparisons are between samples of broadly similar age, they are not specifically age-matched nor of the same sample size. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> this was a better approach because published data on young adults are generally of studies involving larger sample sizes, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> {{there was no need to}} try to replicate.|$|R
