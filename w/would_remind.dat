5|$|On 5 March 2012, {{prior to}} release, Kolkata Metro {{authorities}} objected to {{a scene in}} which Vidya is pushed by a man onto the tracks as a train arrives. They requested that the scene be removed, as it <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> people of the past suicides, which had tarnished the railway's image. The filmmakers screened the scene for the authorities and explained that nothing in the film would affect the image of the Metro or prompt people to commit suicide. Convinced, the officials withdrew their objections, and the scene was retained, although it was removed from trailers.|$|E

25|$|On August 30, NCMC voted {{unanimously}} to approve the memorial foundation's preferred site on Washington Avenue SW. NCMC gave active consideration to six of the sites proposed by the foundation. District of Columbia officials strongly supported the preferred site in their testimony before the commission. D.C. officials expressed concern about two issues, however. The first {{was the number of}} pedestrians crossing 2nd Street SW to the east and Independence Avenue SW to the north to reach the memorial. The second was the weight of the planned memorial. The man-made below-ground structure supporting the existing parkland and streets was not designed to carry a heavy granite or bronze memorial, nor the weight of a fountain. They cautioned that the District of Columbia supported the preferred site only because they understood that the memorial would consist of a garden rather than sculpture or a monument. City officials, however, pledged to work with memorial designers to overcome these problems. Brown testified that the DVLMF supported the site because it had a direct line of sight with the U.S. Capitol, and <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> members of Congress of their weighty responsibilities when considering issues of war and peace.|$|E
25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the very eyes of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E

500|$|... "Cuando" [...] (When), {{also in a}} minor key, is a pop R ballad {{featuring}} synthesizers and percussion with Caribbean {{roots and}} Afro-Latin influences. It uses electric-guitar riffs, an acoustic guitar, a string orchestra and a piano. In the song, Queen explores {{what happens when a}} relationship ends: [...] "Adam sinned because he loved Eve, the love of Celia and Pedro touched the stars, but only when you learn to value women, can you be happy". An editor for iTunes claimed the song's lyrics to be sultry. She stated that of the 16 tracks, [...] "Cuando" [...] means the most to her because it is an Rbolero track which <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> men to value women.|$|E
500|$|Eric Greenwood for Drawer B called [...] "Cool" [...] "a {{retrofitted}} [...] with stale synths and chugging guitars" [...] with [...] "dorkier lyrics {{than even}} Cyndi Lauper would dare". Sandy Cohen from the Toronto Star called it [...] "the year's love anthem". Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne described Stefani, in [...] "Cool" [...] {{and in another}} song ("The Real Thing"), as [...] "a glacial '80s synthpop zombie". Krissi Murison from NME found Stefani's performance reminiscent of [...] "Madonna's breathless purr". John Murphy wrote for musicOMH that [...] "Cool" [...] <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> No Doubt fans of [...] "Don't Speak".

[...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times [...] gave it a three-out-of-four rating, saying [...] "Its 22 tracks should be two albums: The first, a club-directed missile helmed by [...] "Darkchild" [...] Rodney Jerkins and Jackson's beau, Jermaine Dupri, could reassert Jackson's primacy among glamazon hit-makers; the second, a bedroom-bound ladies' favorite coauthored by soul dauphin Ne-Yo, <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> fans of Jackson's gift for creating truly tender smut." ...|$|E

500|$|Richardson's film {{career began}} in 1931 as an uncredited extra in Dreyfus; {{he did not}} take film seriously as a medium, but {{undertook}} the work for money. His career in film was described by the film historian Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, as [...] "prolific and random"; McFarlane considered that in Richardson's performances, [...] "he <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> one that he had few peers and no superiors in his particular line". Richardson won many awards for his performances on stage and screen before his death, including a BAFTA award for The Sound Barrier; an Evening Standard Award for Home, which he shared with John Gielgud; and a special Laurence Olivier Award. His final film, —for which he received further critical plaudits and award nominations—was released after his death.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, Harrison Ford {{was cast}} {{alongside}} Craig. Favreau had cast Craig and Ford {{in the film}} because they were actors who suited the action-adventure roles so the characters would be less seen as comedic. The director compared Ford, in particular, with John Wayne in having [...] "a sense of history" [...] with the actor and the role. Before Cowboys & Aliens, Ford had previously acted in the Western films A Time for Killing in 1967, Journey to Shiloh in 1969 and The Frisco Kid in 1979. While Ford {{is well known for}} playing Indiana Jones, the filmmakers wanted to avoid giving him a cowboy hat that <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> audiences too much of Jones. Writer Alex Kurtzman said, [...] "We needed to make sure that—no pun intended—we tipped a hat to iconography of Harrison Ford and also presented the audience with a very different version." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tim McGraw" [...] is {{the debut}} single and first {{published}} song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song {{was written by}} Swift and Liz Rose, and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on June 19, 2006 by Big Machine Records as Swift's debut single and the lead single from Swift's eponymous debut album. Swift wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during her freshman year of high school, knowing {{that she and her}} senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. The song was written about all the different things that <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] is a musical interconnection of traditional and modern country music. Lyrically, the track lists items in order to associate a past relationship, one of them being country artist Tim McGraw's music.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Irrational Games—briefly {{known as}} 2K Boston/2K Australia—released a spiritual {{successor}} to the System Shock series, entitled BioShock. The game takes place in an abandoned underwater utopian community destroyed by the genetic modification of its populace and shares many gameplay elements with System Shock 2: reconstitution stations can be activated, allowing the player to be resurrected when they die; hacking, ammo conservation, and exploration are integral parts of gameplay; and unique powers may be acquired via plasmids, special abilities that function similarly to psionics in System Shock 2. The two titles also share plot similarities and employ audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions to reveal backstory. In BioShock Infinite, Irrational Games included a gameplay feature called [...] "1999 Mode", specifically in reference to System Shock 2s release year, {{designed to provide a}} similar game experience with a higher difficulty and long-lasting effects of choices made that <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> players of System Shocks unforgiving nature.|$|E
500|$|Liam Neeson reprises {{his role}} as the voice of the lion Aslan. Aslan is [...] "more parental here, [...] lets the kids, well, make their own mistakes". Aslan's {{entrance}} was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature, and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil. Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis' version of Jesus, Neeson [...] "see him more as the spirit of the planet – this living, breathing planet. That's what he stands for, for me; more what the native Americans would believe." [...] As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film, the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly. His pose had to be regal, but if he moved his head too much, he <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> viewers of a dog. As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent, Aslan's eyes were also changed to look less [...] "Egyptian". Many of his shots were finished at the last minute.|$|E
500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> these people that ... this ceremony {{has less to do with}} Spiro Agnew than with the office I held".|$|E
30|$|Under these conditions, it is {{necessary}} to test the presence of market discipline, to support disclosure policy, and to verify if the monetary authorities send clear signals about government involvement in the case of bank failure.

500|$|Speaking of Bhukya's performance, the San Francisco Chronicle writes, [...] "Bhukya {{delivers}} an entrancing {{and natural}} performance, deftly balancing both the wide-eyed childishness {{of a young}} girl with the dawning awareness of life's darker possibilities. She's also an accomplished dancer, which she proves at several points in the film." [...] It adds, [...] "can this wonder-filled film truly be not only Domalpalli's first feature, but originally part of a thesis submission at Columbia University? Both in the film's writing and direction, Domalpalli displays maturity, wisdom and a loving sense of visual and character detail." [...] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle proclaimed, [...] "director Domalpalli, who, with his debut feature, turned in what may well be the best Columbia University master's thesis ever." [...] The Hartford Courant also claimed like the Chicago Tribune that the film <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> the Western audience of Charles Dickens, and further stated that it [...] "... gives a detailed sense of place and shows a mastery of story telling. The themes of fate and class resonate and the work of the amateur players is remarkably moving." ...|$|E
500|$|Docter {{noted that}} the film {{reflects}} his friendships with Disney veterans Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Joe Grant (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them). Grant gave the script his approval {{as well as some}} advice before his death in 2005. Docter recalled that Grant <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> him that the audience needed an [...] "emotional bedrock" [...] because of how wacky the adventure would become; here it is Carl mourning for his wife. Docter felt that Grant's personality influenced Carl's deceased wife Ellie more than the grouchy main character, and Carl was primarily based on Spencer Tracy, Walter Matthau, James Whitmore, and their own grandparents, because there was [...] "something sweet about these grumpy old guys". Docter and Jonas Rivera noted Carl's charming nature in spite of his grumpiness derives from the elderly [...] "hav this charm and almost this 'old man license' to say things that other people couldn't get away with [...] It's like how we would go to eat with Joe Grant and he would call the waitresses 'honey'. I wish I could call a waitress 'honey'." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they <b>would</b> <b>remind</b> Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which she would always re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix will remind fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. She went in and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. We wanted to have something for all of her fans." ...|$|E
