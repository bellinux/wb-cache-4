5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} <b>weaponry.</b> In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough <b>weaponry</b> for only some 32,000 soldiers. On 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2015, the Ministry of Defence's Guulwade Plan {{identifies}} {{the equipment and}} <b>weaponry</b> requirements of the army.|$|E
5|$|The Projector, 2.5inchmore {{commonly}} known as the Northover Projectorwas an ad hoc anti-tank weapon used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available <b>weaponry</b> was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank <b>weaponry.</b> The Northover Projector was designed by a Home Guard officer named Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Gun was {{an ad hoc}} {{anti-tank}} artillery piece used by the British Army and Home Guard {{during the}} Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available <b>weaponry</b> was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank <b>weaponry.</b> The Smith Gun was designed by a retired Army Major named William H. Smith as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1941 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|The {{interface}} and gameplay style do {{not differ}} much from the previous title. MediEvil 2 sees the player once again in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque, who can use various forms of <b>weaponry,</b> such as close range swords and clubs to long-range crossbows or catapults. The game contains several of the original forms of gameplay, <b>weaponry,</b> and graphics that {{were present in the}} first instalment of the series. Similar to its predecessor, Dan is able to tear off his skeletal arm {{and use it as a}} club to fight off enemies during the early levels. Whilst featuring many of the classic swords and other medieval <b>weaponry,</b> new weapons featured in MediEvil 2 include pistols, shotguns and Gatling guns.|$|E
5|$|The route {{by which}} Knox moved the <b>weaponry</b> {{is now known}} as the Henry Knox Trail, and the states of New York and Massachusetts have erected markers along the route.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{electronics}} added for <b>weaponry</b> control, all four battleships were {{outfitted with a}} communications suite used by both cruisers and guided missile cruisers in service at the time. This communication suite included the OE-82 antenna for satellite communications, but {{did not include the}} Naval Tactical Data System.|$|E
5|$|Austrian and Czech foreign {{exchange}} reserves were soon seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as <b>weaponry</b> and aircraft, which were shipped back to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 is {{a shooter}} game, with players {{predominantly}} experiencing gameplay from a first-person perspective. Players {{use a combination}} of human and alien <b>weaponry</b> and vehicles to progress through the game's levels. The player's health bar is not visible, but players are instead equipped with a damage-absorbing shield that regenerates when not taking fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Steve Rogers {{is deemed}} {{physically}} unfit to {{enlist in the}} U.S. Army and fight the Nazis in World War II. Recruited for a secret military operation, he is physically transformed into a super-soldier dubbed Captain America and must battle the Red Skull, head of a Nazi <b>weaponry</b> division known as Hydra.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{there was}} more {{controversy}} at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space <b>weaponry)</b> and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research. More recently, MIT’s research for the military has included work on robots, drones and ‘battle suits’.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Game {{offered the}} {{exclusive}} Explorer Edition bundle, which included an exploration themed Challenge Tomb and a skill upgrade. Exclusive to Tesco was the Combat Strike Pack, which included three <b>weaponry</b> upgrades and a skill upgrade.|$|E
5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works is that they are, {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances. The introduction of <b>weaponry</b> into Chinese ballet—regardless of the revolutionary message—was, itself, a revolution.|$|E
5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using <b>weaponry</b> and in their athletic ability. The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt {{at the sound of}} bells and drums.|$|E
5|$|The CEO {{and later}} Executive President of Wayne Enterprises, {{who runs the}} company on Bruce's behalf and serves as his armorer for the Batsuit, {{providing}} him with high-tech equipment and discreetly developing cutting-edge technology and <b>weaponry,</b> even as Wayne Enterprises starts losing money.|$|E
5|$|The Contact Period in Guatemala's {{northern}} Petén lowlands {{lasted from}} 1525 through to 1700. Superior Spanish <b>weaponry</b> {{and the use}} of cavalry, although decisive in the northern Yucatán, were ill-suited to warfare in the dense forests of lowland Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} {{of the s}} {{underwent a}} massive development since the first Iowa-class ship was laid down in June 1940. Owing to the continual development of the <b>weaponry</b> aboard these battleships they remain the most heavily armed gunships the United States has ever put to sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} was battle-tested in 1915 when Germany {{attacked the}} Russian Empire, and withstood eleven days of assault before capture. After World War I, the fortress' military importance declined as advances in <b>weaponry</b> rendered it increasingly obsolete. It {{was used by}} various civil institutions and as a garrison.|$|E
5|$|The noble {{train of}} artillery, {{also known as}} the Knox Expedition, was an {{expedition}} led by Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox to transport heavy <b>weaponry</b> that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga to the Continental Army camps outside Boston, Massachusetts during the winter of 1775–1776.|$|E
5|$|The {{required}} causation may {{be quite}} oblique. As well as <b>weaponry</b> held in the hand, <b>weaponry</b> thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic. The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought. Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.|$|E
5|$|To {{raise the}} funds for ships and <b>weaponry,</b> Monmouth pawned many of his belongings. His wife Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, and her mother also pawned their {{jewellery}} to hire the Dutch warship Helderenberg.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available <b>weaponry,</b> the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|As the {{tradition}} of Troilus the warrior advances through time, the <b>weaponry</b> and the form of combat change. Already in Dares he is a mounted warrior, not a charioteer or foot warrior, something anachronistic to epic narrative. In later versions he is a knight with armour appropriate {{to the time of}} writing who fights against other knights and dukes. His expected conduct, including his romance, conforms to courtly or other values contemporary to the writing.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Soviet Tartu Operation, the ratio of Soviet to German strength was 4.3:1 for troops, 14.8:1 for artillery and 4.1:1 for armour. The German forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller units from different branches. A significant proportion of the German side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor <b>weaponry</b> and little fighting ability.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in <b>weaponry.</b> However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, South Vietnamese commanders never {{realized}} that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility {{to respond to}} the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied North Vietnamese units with <b>weaponry</b> that was required to achieve their objectives. Ultimately, the average South Vietnamese soldiers would {{have to pay for the}} miscalculation of their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Ganga Mahal {{was built}} in the 20th century by Ganga Singh who reigned for 56 years from 1887 to 1943, has a large durbar hall known as the Ganga Singh Hall that houses the Museum. The museum has {{exhibits}} of war <b>weaponry</b> and also a World War I aeroplane (biplane), which is stated to be well maintained.|$|E
5|$|He first learns of his body's {{superior}} {{resistance to}} physical injury during the war. Bullets and bayonets glance off his tough skin. He {{believes he can}} even survive a plane crash. The only <b>weaponry</b> capable of penetrating his skin at the time are the largest artillery shells. Although, he still feels {{the effects of the}} elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is lightning, which ultimately kills him.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and <b>weaponry</b> used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real <b>weaponry</b> from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic <b>weaponry</b> and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut Grant's supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker {{attacked}} Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by recently enlisted United States Colored Troops. Despite having inferior <b>weaponry,</b> they fought bravely and finally repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief but from the cautious Johnston.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Bagramyan's army, {{under the}} overall command of Vasilievsky, {{took part in}} the advance into East Prussia. In Operation Samland, Bagramyan's First Baltic Front, now known as the Samland Group, {{captured}} Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) in April. On 9 May 1945, he accepted the surrender of the German forces penned up in Latvia, capturing a total of 158 aircraft, 18,000 vehicles, 500 tanks and assault guns among other <b>weaponry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft <b>weaponry.</b> In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E
5|$|It {{came to the}} Queen's {{attention}} that Frenchman Jean Laborde, who had been shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable {{in the production of}} cannons, muskets and gunpowder. Ranavalona provided him with the labor and materials to establish factories that met the material needs of her army, thereby ending the kingdom's dependence on Europe for modern <b>weaponry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several common {{features}} with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large shields and, in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and <b>weaponry.</b> Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.|$|E
