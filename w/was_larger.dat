5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E

25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number is said to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than the other number. If a number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than another number, and if the other number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than a third number, then the first number <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than the third number. Example: five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than four, and four <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three, therefore five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than three. But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> than five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> than three.

Ratings continued to decline on the Thursday evening shows, with both shows being viewed by fewer than four million viewers for the first time, 3.81m and 3.86m respectively, seeing the first show being beaten by BBC One's Watchdog which gained 5.23m in the 8pm slot.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene <b>was</b> <b>larger,</b> heavier and {{more powerful than the}} Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E
5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E

It broke through the security cordon and moved to Tahrir Square. Thousands protested in Cairo, with 15,000 occupying Tahrir Square (Liberation Square). Police used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who in turn threw stones at police, eventually forcing them to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Due to First World War losses, Cunard began a post-war {{rebuilding}} programme including eleven intermediate liners. It {{acquired the}} former Hapag Imperator (renamed the Berengaria) {{to replace the}} lost Lusitania as the running mate for Mauretania and Aquitania, and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three-ship express service.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} diurnal {{variation}} of the air-pressure system in the urban Tokyo.

After sunset, firstly the pressure rise <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the downtown Tokyo, thereafter <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> in the suburban Tokyo. In winter, the diurnal variation is almost opposite. Commonly, while the area-averaged air-pressure drops, the pressure drop <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the downtown; while rises, the pressure rise <b>is</b> firstly <b>larger</b> in the suburban. The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides also contribute to these diurnal variations...|$|R
5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} with how the employees were working so vigorously.
