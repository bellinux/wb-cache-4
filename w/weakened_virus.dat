5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the <b>weakened</b> <b>virus</b> can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E

[...] The stage was set for Theiler to develop a vaccine against the disease. Theiler first devised a test for the efficacy of experimental vaccines. In his test, sera from vaccinated human subjects were injected into mice {{to see if they}} protected the mice against yellow fever virus. This “mouse protection test” was used with variations as a measure of immunity until after World War II. [...] Subculturing the particularly virulent Asibi strain from West Africa in chicken embryos, a technique pioneered by Ernest Goodpasture, the Rockefeller team sought to obtain an attenuated strain of the virus that would not kill mice when injected into their brains. It took until 1937, and more than 100 subcultures in chicken embryos, for Theiler and his colleague Hugh Smith to obtain an attenuated strain, which they named [...] "17D". Animal tests showed the attenuated 17D mutant was safe and immunizing. Theiler's team rapidly completed the development of a 17D vaccine, and the Rockefeller Foundation began human trials in South America. Between 1940 and 1947, the Rockefeller Foundation produced more than 28 million doses of the vaccine and finally ended yellow fever as a major disease.|$|E

30|$|As popular antireviral therapies, reverse-transcriptase (RT) {{inhibitor}} and {{protease inhibitor}} (PI) suppress {{the reproduction of}} virion particles. Recent investigations showed that the persistence of latent viral reservoirs is responsible for viral rebound. Such a reservoir is insensitive to HAART and able to self-re-establish. It is necessary to evaluate the effects that the cell-to-cell infection has on viral dynamics. HIV <b>viruses</b> <b>weaken</b> and damage human immune systems, and invade many target cells. In this article, we propose a mathematical model with infection age to investigate the viral dynamics of HIV with different therapies. Cell-to-cell and multi-target-cell infections are both integrated into the model to consider their effects {{on the evolution of}} the virus under treatments. We obtain the basic reproduction number of the model, which determines the persistence of the disease. We show that when the basic reproduction number is less than one, the virus-free equilibrium is globally stable. On the other hand, if it is greater than one, then the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. It follows from the expression of the basic reproduction number that multi-target-cell and cell-to-cell infections contribute positively to the value of the basic reproduction number. Such type of infections was underestimated. Revealing the consequences of multi-target-cell and cell-to-cell infections provides insights into the development of optimal therapy to control the disease.|$|R
40|$|There is {{persistent}} and constantly growing {{need for new}} antimicrobials which will be alternative to antibiotics. Wide usage of antibiotics has detected a number of negative factors. First, it is rapid appearance and spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganism strains. Second, {{it has been found}} out that antibiotics have a bad influence on microbiocoenosis. Moreover they lead to dysbacteriosis, disturb the intake and uptake of the nutrients, and weaken the immunity. Finally, antibiotics have no effect on viruses. It is possible that virus diseases are widespread nowadays just because of such unreasonably wide usage of antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the viral etiology diseases account for more than 75 % {{of the total number of}} infectious diseases and the percentage is growing. New dangerous infections appear such as atypical pneumonia, which is caused by coronavirus, bird flu, etc. As a rule the attempts of prompt production of virus vaccines are unsuccessful due to the ability of viruses to mutate and evolve rapidly. Mixed infections have become of great interest, e. g. in case when bacteria become more active in the organism <b>weakened</b> by some <b>virus.</b> The most illustrative case is HIV infection.

40|$|Herpes viruses {{have evolved}} over time {{developing}} a complex strategy for maintaining persistent infection in humans. This sophisticated group of viruses usually persists asymptomatically {{for the life}} of the host, controlled by constant immune surveillance. These viruses stimulate a large number of T cells which suppress the virus and protect the host from herpes-related pathologies. However, if the immune system is <b>weakened,</b> the <b>virus</b> may become lytic, proliferate and initiate pathogenesis. The outcome of infection with these viruses is highly variable, and an unfortunate minority suffer major life threatening clinical problems. For this reason, it is important to understand the complicated machinations involved in T cell immunology and how it works to actively control virus. Viral peptide epitopes are present on the surface of virus-infected cells and are recognised by the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) of the immune system only when bound to cell surface molecules called human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in humans. These HLA molecules are highly polymorphic, with each different HLA capable of binding a distinct set of viral peptides. Over the last 2 decades, various studies have identified the viral peptides that are recognised in the CTL response to herpes viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The critical molecule on the surface of CTLs that is involved in specific recognition of viral peptides is the T cell receptor (TCR). To accommodate the huge variety of viral peptides presented by infected cells, millions of different TCR molecules are expressed by CTLs to ensure an appropriate TCR is available for binding to most viral peptides. Interestingly, some viral peptides are recognised by a large variety of TCR molecules while others are targeted by very few. This restriction in TCR usage is sometimes so extreme that the same “public TCRs” emerge in different individuals through mechanisms that are unclear. Polymorphism within the various levels of these immune responses may alter or compromise immunogenic competence. Highly polymorphic HLA molecules and viral genome sequence variability, in addition to TCR gene polymorphism could represent an important mechanism for inter-individual differences in antiviral T cell responses and disease progression. A more complete understanding of the influence these factors have on the immune system and disease pathogenesis will likely enhance both theoretical and clinical immunology...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that infection of monocytes by viruses such as cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency <b>virus</b> <b>weakens</b> host natural immunity. In the present study, we demonstrated the capability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to infect and replicate in freshly isolated human monocytes. Using electron microscopy analysis, we observed the presence of EBV virions in the cytoplasm and nuclei of approximately 20 % of monocytes. This was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of EBV genomic DNA sequences in isolated nuclei from monocytes. Infection of monocytes by EBV leads to the activation of the replicative cycle. This {{was supported by the}} detection of immediate-early lytic mRNA BZLF- 1 transcripts, and by the presence of two early lytic transcripts (BALF- 2, which appears to function in DNA replication, and BHRF- 1, also associated with the replicative cycle). The late lytic BcLF- 1 transcripts, which code for the major nucleocapsid protein, were also detected, as well as EBNA- 1 transcripts. However, attempts to detect EBNA- 2 transcripts have yielded negative results. Viral replication was also confirmed by the release of newly synthesized infectious viral particles in supernatants of EBV-infected monocytes. EBV-infected monocytes were found to have significantly reduced phagocytic activity, as evaluated by the quantification of ingested carboxylated fluoresceinated latex beads. Taken together, our results suggest that EBV infection of monocytes and alteration of their biological functions might represent a new mechanism to disrupt the immune response and promote viral propagation during the early stages of infection...|$|R
