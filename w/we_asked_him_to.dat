500|$|Abu Nidal {{had carried}} out the {{operation}} without the permission of Fatah. Abu Iyad (Arafat's deputy) and Mahmoud Abbas (later President of the Palestinian Authority), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: [...] "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> mount it for us." [...] Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as {{under the control of}} the Iraqi government.|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of}} the sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
2500|$|Jim McKellar, {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} London Knights when Perry played for them, has said about Perry: [...] "He's a very personable guy who has a great sense of humour. He's also great with the fans. He was always very accommodating and never said no to anything <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> participate in. Whether it was a trip to the hospital or an autograph session, Corey was great. He was the ideal ambassador." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{a gentleman}} coming," [...] {{she said to}} me, {{pointing}} {{in the direction of}} Ramsgate. [...] "You can never walk back. Shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> send a chaise from Broadstairs to the gap in the cliff?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Devine {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "Grant has {{not been}} away for almost two weeks now, and it is quite that time since we have seen Mr. Brooke," [...] she said. [...] "Didn't <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come when you had Minnie here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do ye {{hear this}} boasting Egyptian, who talks of {{entering}} the reeds and facing the lions in their lair, {{a thing that}} no man dare do where none can see to shoot? What say ye now? Shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> prove his words?" ...|$|R
2500|$|After Sepp Blatter's sudden {{departure}} at Fifa on 2 June 2015, when Blatter {{claimed he}} was resigning for honourable reasons and to allow Fifa to move on, Dyke said," [...] I don't believe a word of this. [...] If he believes that, why not step down last week when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to?</b> [...] He was cock-a-hoop {{when he won the}} election and terribly arrogant. [...] Clearly there is a smoking gun. [...] This is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honourable; he hasn't been honourable for years".|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> give us {{the history}} of the case, and he did so.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> tell it. He {{dropped out}} of his {{conversational}} vein and back into his lecture-gait without an effort, and rolled on as follows-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mortimer Lightwood,' resumes Veneering, 'whom {{you both}} know, {{is out of}} town; but he writes, in his {{whimsical}} manner, that as <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be bridegroom's best man when the ceremony takes place, he will not refuse, though he doesn't see {{what he has to}} do with it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{must be a}} forlorn condition,' said Albinia; 'he {{is above}} the other clerks, {{and he seems to}} be voted below the Bayford Elite, since the Polysyllable has made it so very refined! One never meets him {{anywhere}} now it is too dark to walk after the banking hours. Cannot <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come in some evening?' ...|$|R
5000|$|As for Lynch's {{contribution}} to the band's sound, Courtney commented, [...] "He's a very different musician from Matthew, all around. <b>We</b> weren't <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join to replace Matthew. <b>We</b> were <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join {{in order to make}} the band new. He was a friend, yes, but it was an added bonus that he would be pretty different from Matt. So it was exciting for us to see what that meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Robert? Yes, {{he called}} {{when we first}} came to town, and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dinner; {{but he said it}} was a fast day; and you know Sir Nicholas would never {{encourage}} that sort of thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We met at Grindelwald, you know. He always {{calls me}} his Ice Maiden because {{we first got}} to know each other on the skating rink. Quite romantic, wasn't it? Then <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> tea one day, and we got to be quite friendly. Then he proposed." ...|$|E
60|$|One day, {{a little}} while after this, Satan {{appeared}} again. We were always watching out for him, for life was never very stagnant when he was by. He came upon us at that place in the woods where we had first met him. Being boys, {{we wanted to be}} entertained; <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do a show for us.|$|E
60|$|God is Love. Can <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Him</b> <b>to</b> be more? God is Intelligence. Can we {{inform the}} {{infinite}} Mind, or tell Him anything He does not already comprehend? Do {{we hope to}} change perfection? Shall we plead for more at the open fount, which always pours forth more than we receive? The unspoken prayer does bring us nearer the Source of all existence and blessedness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear. There is {{an end of}} that, and I'm {{sorry for}} him. I think that if I had been a young man at The Cleeve, I should have done just the same. And now let us decide this {{important}} question. When Master Graham's ribs, arms, and collar bones are a little stronger, shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come back to Noningsby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Arriving at the door, the Frenchman bethought {{himself of}} his {{travelling}} companion. 'My scene-painter {{is here with}} me,' he said, 'on the look-out for materials. An excellent fellow, who will {{take it as a}} kindness if <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join us. I'll tell the porter <b>to</b> send <b>him</b> up when he comes in.' He handed the key of his room to Francis. 'I {{will be back in a}} minute. It's at the end of the corridor--13 A.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{we could never}} make out where he got the drink. That was the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his face, he would only laugh, if he were drunk, and if he were sober, deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water.|$|E
60|$|I shall {{always be}} ashamed {{of the way that}} woman wheedled the Altrurian, when we found him the next morning, walking up and down the piazza, before breakfast--that is, it was before our breakfast; when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go in with us, he said he had just had his breakfast, and was waiting for Reuben Camp, who had promised to take him up as he passed with a load of hay for one of the hotels in the village.|$|E
6000|$|There is no {{need for}} me to trouble you with a {{narrative}} of what I saw--favored by Doctor Wybrow's introduction--at the French boy's bedside. It was simply a repetition of what I had already heard. There he lay, {{at the height of the}} fever, asking, in the intervals of relief, intelligent questions relating to the medicines administered to him; and perfectly understanding the answers. He was only irritable when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take his memory back to the time before his illness; and then he answered in French, [...] "I haven't got a memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Saduko, let us humble {{ourselves}} no {{more before}} this white man. After all, he is right; {{the business is}} none of his, and why should <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> risk his life in our quarrel, knowing as we do that white men are not like us; they think {{a great deal of}} their lives. Farewell, Macumazahn. If I conquer and grow great you will always be welcome in Zululand, whereas if I fail perhaps you will be best over the Tugela river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack, hadn't <b>we</b> better <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{take us to}} the Hall first?" [...] whispered Fred to his cousin. [...] "Maybe Colonel Colby can {{fix this}} up for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|We went {{on without}} saying more. [...] "Well, that's not Colonel Clay, anyhow," [...] I said, {{as we got}} out of earshot. [...] "For he accosted us first; and you may {{remember}} it's one of the Colonel's most marked peculiarities that, like the model child, he never speaks till he's spoken to--never begins an acquaintance. He always waits till we make the first advance; he doesn't go {{out of his way to}} cheat us; he loiters about till <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On Monday afternoon, 15th, Mr. Codrington {{went for}} {{a ride to the}} other side of the island, and there espied the schooner, eight miles off. He rode home quickly, and soon the {{shouting}} and racing of the boys told us that the vessel had come. They were all at arrowroot- making. Never, I think, had the whole party, English and natives, seemed in higher spirits. Mr. Bice walked to the settlement, to see if she was far in enough to land that night; <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> call and tell us on his way home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, we only {{asked him}} to get out of bed, and we put his helmet and {{sword-belt}} on for him, and we sung him bits out of the Blue Fairy Book--the cram-book on Army organisation. Oh yes, and then <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> drink old Clausewitz's health, as a brother-tactician, in milk-punch and Worcester sauce, and so on. We had to help him a little there. He bites. There wasn't much else that time; but, you know, the War Office is severe on ragging these days.' Bobby stopped with a lopsided smile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know not}} what that may be. Witta {{had found him}} half dead among ice {{on the shores of}} Muscovy. We thought he was a devil. He crawled before us and brought food in a silver dish which these sea-wolves had robbed from some rich abbey, and Witta with his own hands gave us wine. He spoke a little in French, a little in South Saxon, and much in the Northman's tongue. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> set us ashore, {{promising}} to pay him better ransom than he would get price if he sold us to the Moors--as once befell a knight of my acquaintance sailing from Flushing.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{one morning}} he appeared, at about half past nine, {{just as we}} were {{finishing}} breakfast. It was sunny and warm and beautiful, so <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> please <b>to</b> come with us picnicking.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was thinking,' said Mrs. Ashford, 'how forlorn {{it will be}} {{for that}} poor youth to spend his Christmas-day alone in that great house. Don't you think <b>we</b> might <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dinner?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Scraps, [...] "suppose {{we go in}} {{and find}} him? Very likely if <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> politely <b>to</b> let us pull three hairs out of {{the tip of his}} tail he won't hurt us." ...|$|R
60|$|The carriage--an open barouche--was ready. Ferguson mounted {{beside the}} driver, and we whirled away to breakfast. As was proper, Mr. Ferguson stood by to {{transmit}} our orders and answer questions. By and by, he mentioned casually--the artful adventurer--that {{he would go}} and get his breakfast {{as soon as we}} had finished ours. He knew we could not get along without him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait for him. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sit down and eat with us. He begged, with many a bow, to be excused. It was not proper, he said; he would sit at another table. We ordered him peremptorily to sit down with us.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{come up on}} {{the deck}} with only one {{companion}} that his sickness might be ascertained, and after much hesitation he consented to do so. Bickley made {{an examination of the}} growth and announced that he believed it could be removed with perfect safety as the attachment to the neck was very slight, but of course there was always a risk. This was explained to him with difficulty, and much talk followed between him and his followers who gathered on the beach beneath the ship. They seemed adverse to the experiment, till Marama grew furious with them and at last burst into tears saying that he could no longer drag this terrible burden about with him, and he touched the growth. He would rather die. Then they gave way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, {{but he is}} a {{very odd}} young man. I do not know what he would be at. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come home with us for a day or two: Charles {{undertook}} to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come. I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, by-and-by. I always require {{half an hour}} to get up my courage {{after being}} criticised by Herr Klesmer. <b>We</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play to us now: he is bound to show us what is good music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By all means, my dear mother. Mr. MacGlue is a {{sensible}} person. We pass his house {{on our way}} home, and <b>we</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> dinner. In the meantime, let us say no more on the subject till we see the doctor." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 2 September 1963, seven Quebec MPs {{announced}} {{that they would be}} supporting Caouette’s breakaway faction: Maurice Coté (Chicoutimi), Jean-Louis Frenette (Portneuf), Chapdelaine, Gerard Ouelette (Rimouski), Marcel Lessard (Lac-Saint-Jean) and Gerard Grouard (Labelle). Dr. Marcoux rejoined the Social Credit Party and announced his loyalty to Thompson. (Marcoux had never stated his reasons for quitting the party, but said that the reasons had now been removed.) This left the Thompson faction with 11 MPs, the Caouette faction with ten, and three MPs who had not announced. The Ralliement's riding executive in Marcoux's Quebec—Montmorency riding called for his resignation, saying that he had [...] "betrayed us, has lost our confidence forever, and for the last time <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign." ...|$|R
