25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> to understand the universe better.|$|E

It is only after we have listened to each in its individuality that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> to gain the full richness which comes from the 'stereoscopic' vision of Jesus as seen through four different pairs of eyes!" ...|$|E

Let us, {{the inhabitants of the}} Cape Colony, be swift to recognise that we are one people, cast together under a glorious flag of liberty, with heads clear enough to appreciate the freedom we enjoy, and hearts resolute to maintain our true privileges; let us desist from reproaching and insulting one another, and, rejoicing that we have this goodly land as a common heritage, remember that by united action only can we realise its grand possibilities. We belong both of us to a home-loving stock, and the peace and prosperity of every home in the land is at stake. On our action now depends the question whether our children shall curse or bless us; whether we shall live in their memory as promoters of civil strife, with all its miserable consequences, or as joint architects of a happy, prosperous, and united state. Each of us looks back to a noble past. United, we may ensure to our descendants a not unworthy future. Disunited, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> for nothing but stagnation, misery and ruin.

It then discusses some positive efforts {{to deal with the}} problem such as legalization and decriminalization.

The article then addresses whether the constitution bans drugs at all. Finally, the article concludes by stating that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>hope</b> to fully eliminate drug use, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>hope</b> to contain it, and gives some suggestions that will begin the path to controlling drug use...|$|R
