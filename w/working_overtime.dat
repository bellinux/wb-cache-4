While looking into their medical {{histories}} for the baby's interest, Mike is forced to tell Susan that he lied about his father being dead. Susan visits Mike's father, Nick (Robert Forster), who is in jail for murder. Nick warns Susan that Mike is still troubled by demons of his past. With the stress of finances for the baby, Mike begins <b>working</b> <b>overtime,</b> despite an injury resulting from the hit-and-run over a year ago. He begins relying heavily on painkillers. Susan confronts Mike about his addiction, threatening to leave him {{if he does not}} enter rehab; he agrees to admit himself. After a devastating tornado hits Wisteria Lane, Bree, Orson, and their newborn, Benjamin, move into Susan's house temporarily. During his stay, Orson develops a sleep walking habit and unconsciously admits to running over Mike with his car. Susan feels extremely betrayed and Bree, unable to forgive Orson, asks him to move out. Shortly after, Susan gives birth to a boy, whom she names Maynard, after Mike's deceased grandfather.|$|E

500|$|Since {{finding the}} right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time, the show had already begun taping around the {{character}} for two weeks. Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children <b>working</b> <b>overtime</b> to catch up. [...] "By the time we had resolved some of the terms," [...] he said, [...] "they were really against the wall in terms of back story.... In retrospect, I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day!" [...] Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story. To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene's main action. After those scenes were taped, they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes. This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up. Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe. He said, [...] "They had devised this sort of 'tapestry' layered look for Dimitri {{and it was like}} doing scenes inside a sauna." [...] This was eventually rectified, but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks.|$|E

The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets". Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since Artpop sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience.

500|$|The {{office workers}} are stuck <b>working</b> <b>overtime</b> {{on a major}} assignment. After asking Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to confirm {{that he has not}} made any plans for the evening in {{anticipation}} of the overtime assignment, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) calls corporate and declares that he is releasing the workers from overtime. Michael then proceeds to invite Jim and his girlfriend Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to join him and his girlfriend Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) for dinner at his condominium after Jim had previously turned him down nine times. When Jim begins to formulate an excuse, Michael reminds him that he just said he hadn't made any plans. Jim begins to suspect that Michael fabricated the overtime assignment and the call to corporate just to maneuver him and Pam into coming to dinner. Michael also invites Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), but excludes Angela's former boyfriend Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), much to Dwight's dismay. On a tour of the condominium, Jan shows the workspace from which she runs her candle-making home business. Jan's dominance in the relationship is apparent from the living arrangements; Michael sleeps on a small bench due to Jan's [...] "space issues", and his sole comfort is a very small [...] "plasma TV," [...] which he bought for $200. It is also later revealed that Michael underwent three vasectomies in the course of trying to please Jan. Throughout the evening, Jan plays a song by her former assistant, Hunter. Titled [...] "That One Night", the lyrics of the song strongly suggest an intimate encounter once occurred between Jan and Hunter.|$|E

2500|$|Work {{hours and}} sleep loss {{were shown to}} impact {{performance}} in a [...] evaluation by Rogers et al. A total of 393 registered nurses logged scheduled hours worked, actual hours worked, time of day worked, overtime, days off, and sleep/wake patterns. Questions concerning errors and near-errors were also included. Analysis showed that work duration, overtime, and number of hours worked per week significantly affected the number of errors. The likelihood of making an error increased with longer work hours, and was three times higher when the nurses worked shifts lasting 12.5 hours or more. <b>Working</b> <b>overtime</b> increased the odds of making at least one error, regardless of the originally scheduled length of the shift. Working more than 40 and more than 50 hours per week significantly increased the risk of making an error.|$|E

2500|$|During the New Deal {{years as}} well as the 1940s, there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance. The {{government}} clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit, but these policies began to ease. From 1946 to 1947, stocks could not be purchased [...] "on margin", meaning that an investor had to pay 100% of a stock's cost without taking on any loans. But this margin requirement was reduced four times before 1960, each time stimulating a mini-rally and boosting volume, and when the Federal Reserve reduced the margin requirements from 90% to 70%. These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit.

40|$|Background: Utilisation of {{operating}} rooms is {{high on the}} agenda of hospital managers and researchers. Many efforts in the area of maximising the utilisation have been focussed on finding the holy grail of 100 % utilisation. The utilisation that can be realised, however, depends on the patient mix and the willingness to accept the risk of <b>working</b> in <b>overtime.</b> Materials and methods: This is a mathematical modelling study that investigates the association between the utilisation and the patient mix that is served and the risk of <b>working</b> in <b>overtime.</b> Prospectively, consecutively, and routinely collected data of an operating room department in a Dutch university hospital are used. Basic statistical principles are used to establish the relation between realistic utilisation rates, patient mixes, and accepted risk of overtime. Results: Accepting a low risk of overtime combined with a complex patient mix results a low utilisation rate. If the accepted risk of overtime is higher and the patient mix is less complex, the utilisation rate that can be reached is closer to 100 %. Conclusion: Because of the inherent variability of health-care processes, the holy grail of 100 % utilisation is unlikely to be found. The method proposed in this paper calculates a realistic benchmark utilisation that incorporates the patient mix characteristics and the willingness to accept risk of overtime...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Delays are an endemic {{feature of}} the {{construction}} industry. Typically, when a delay occurs in a project, the project manager often expedites progress through activity crashing with respect to available float and time-cost relationships. An accelerated schedule is thus obtained by either prescribing <b>overtime</b> <b>working</b> hours or procuring additional resources {{or a combination of}} both. However, excessively prolonged overtime work can generate quality problems, such as rework, and additional resources. There is therefore a need for a model to assist project managers with understanding the complex nature of attaining a trade-off between <b>overtime</b> <b>working</b> and the procurement of additional resources. In this paper, a system dynamics model for MItigating Days in CONstruction (MiDiCON) due to the effects of prolonged overtime work on project costs and quality is presented To overcome project delays, several options representing various combinations of prescribing overtime work and injecting additional resources are analyzed. Utility theory is then applied to determine the most appropriate solution for mitigating project delays...|$|R
