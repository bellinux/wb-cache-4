500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, {{we might be able to}} find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October, 2013, megachurch pastor Bishop Jim Swilley {{came out}} to his congregation. The YouTube video of the service went viral. Interviews with People magazine, Joy Behar, Don Lemon ABC News and NPR focused on the bullycides that {{prompted}} Bishop Swilley to [...] "come out". One year and five years later, he confirmed the costs but also the freedom he has experienced. [...] "To {{be able to have}} freedom is something that I wouldn't trade anything for." [...] "Being married as yourself, preaching as yourself and living your life as yourself is infinitely better than doing those things as someone else." [...] Bishop Swilley's son, Jared Swilley, bass player and front man of Black Lips said, [...] "It was definitely shocking, but I was actually glad <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I feel closer to him now..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 12:15a.m. on May 18, 2017, Cornell {{was found}} dead by his {{bodyguard}} in the bathroom of his room at the MGM Grand in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17. He {{was lying on the}} floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left around 11:35p.m. The cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging. Cornell was 52 years old. Footage of his final concert was posted on YouTube. Cornell's wife said, [...] "When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Balachander and {{his unit}} could not trace Sulakshana who {{disappeared}} from the film scene 12 years ago. So they decided to kill Bhairavi's character and keep her as a photograph in the serial. As it transpired, Sulakshana {{found out about the}} sequel from the newspapers and contacted Balachander. To his delight, she told him she would play Bhairavi. [...] "They were so happy to see me," [...] she said. [...] "The script was rewritten and Bhairavi was alive again. I am happy to act as Bhairavi. She is still the same soft person. The only difference is she is older and the mother of two children. There is more understanding between JKB and Bhairavi now -- she doesn't fight with him". Carnatic singer Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, who has never acted before, will play Sindhu. When contacted by Minbimangal, a surprised Anuradha was reluctant to accept the offer. [...] "My initial reaction was I am not interested in acting. I am a professional singer. I had absolutely no plans to act. I told them I needed time to think. It was my husband's gentle persuasion that made me meet K Balachander. Once I met him, I was struck by his simplicity. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they would see to it that my kacheris (concerts) would not get affected because of the shooting, I said yes". [...] "That Suhasini acted in the original film does not bother me at all," [...] she says. [...] "I am a student as far as acting is concerned. My only concern is I shouldn't disappoint Balachander". Rajhesh Vaidhya, who is composing the songs for the serial, faces a tough challenge; the songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja for the film are considered masterpieces. Carnatic stalwarts Dr M Balamurali Krishna and Sudha Ragunathan will render the songs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 she {{appeared}} once again alongside Shahrukh Khan in Duplicate, {{the film was}} produced by Yash Johar and was directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The film underperformed {{at the box office}} upon its release. However, Chawla won much appreciation for her performance and her chemistry with Khan was also appreciated. A critic wrote [...] "Juhi Chawla is one of my favourite actresses and she is simply wonderful here. I’m not sure how she manages to keep a straight face through some of Shah Rukh’s more insane moments, but she plays Sonia as quite a serious career woman with a tendency to lecture in English. Although I do prefer her romance with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss they still make a sweet couple here." [...] The same year {{she appeared}} in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's swan song Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate alongside Anil Kapoor; her performance was appreciated by the audiences and critics alike. Rediff while reviewing the film wrote [...] "Only Juhi as the daughter is not based on any character from Hrishida's collection. She carries off her role with her inevitable chirpiness, and looks very good too. Hrishida was right <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Juhi's serene face suited the kind of sacrifice she would make in the film. Only Jaya Bhaduri has managed that serenity in Hrishida's films." [...] However the film flopped at the box office. The same year she also appeared in Priyadarshan's rural drama Saat Rang Ke Sapne opposite Arvind Swamy. Though the film underperformed at the box-office, Chawla's portrayal of a gypsy met with immense critical appreciation. The same year she also appeared in the Malayalam detective comedy film Harikrishnans opposite Mammootty and Mohanlal. Her performance in the film was met with appreciation. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal, Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. Harikrishnans {{turned out to be a}} blockbuster at the Kerala box-office, it was the highest grossing Malayalam film of 1998.|$|E

That was what we called il Tedesco, and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his family name, it ended in stino; but all these foreign names sound alike.

60|$|Lucilla, hearing Oscar {{pronounce}} the name, instantly understood what had happened. She shuddered with horror. Oscar gently placed {{her in my}} arms, and advanced again alone towards his brother. His face expressed the struggle in him of some subtly-mingling influences of love and anguish, of sorrow and shame. He recalled {{to me in the}} strangest manner my past experience of him, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had first trusted me with the story of the Trial, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that Nugent was the good angel of his life.|$|R

60|$|It {{was after}} one {{tremendous}} day when {{his eyes had}} glared on me like lightning--and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express {{the extent of his}} emotion that in the evening when I was alone he joined me with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which I quickly dried <b>when</b> <b>he</b> approached, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that in three days that [sic] he intended to remove with me to his estate in Yorkshire, and bidding me prepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned.|$|R

60|$|He saw me {{warm and}} serious, and {{he changed his}} style immediately; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was sorry I should have such a thought of him; {{that he had never}} given me the least {{occasion}} for it, but had been as tender of my reputation as he could be of his own; that he was sure our correspondence had been managed with so much address, that not one creature in the family had so much as a suspicion of it; that if <b>he</b> smiled <b>when</b> I <b>told</b> him my thoughts, it was at the assurance he lately received, that our understanding one another was not so much as known or guessed at; and that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how much reason he had to be easy, I should smile as he did, for he was very certain it would give me a full satisfaction.|$|R

What secret trouble had he--was it that his affairs were in a bad way, or was he quarrelling with his wife? No, nothing of the kind; it was a long story--this secret trouble of the Ellerbys, and with his unconquerable reticence in regard to other people's private affairs he would have passed it off with a few general remarks.|$|R

40|$|In {{the long}} run, {{the enemy of}} my enemy isn’t always my friend. It’s a mistake that’s proving costly for the Liberals TWENTY years ago, during a long, leisurely lunch {{conversation}} about the Liberals and their history, John Howard expressed the view {{to me that the}} party no longer attracted the sort of people it once had. He spoke frankly – at the time, his chances of a comeback looked close to zero – and I pressed him on the issue. There were solid people in the party <b>when</b> <b>he</b> joined, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> solid citizens. People like his heroes, Robert Cotton and John Carrick. It was their example that attracted him, and that was what had typified the old Liberal Party. It was the mid 1990 s. Howard and his colleagues had been out of government in Canberra for eleven years, and prime minister Paul Keating had just launched another attack on the “spivs” in the Liberal Party. Howard said he wasn’t sure just what Keating meant by the term, but he did concede that “a different sort of person” had become attracted to the party. These people, he suggested, wanted something rather than wanting to offer something. It was a big difference… Read the full articl...|$|R
60|$|I say, I did not forget, therefore, {{to make as}} good {{provision}} for myself as if I had had nothing to have subsisted on but what I now gained; whereas I had not less than ten thousand pounds, as I said above, which I had amassed, or secured rather, out of the ruins of my faithful friend the jeweller, and which he, little thinking of what was so near him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went out, <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> though {{in a kind of}} a jest, was all my own, if he was knocked on the head, and which, upon that title, I took care to preserve.|$|R

And this was certainly a natural occasion; but now here she was named a second time; and what is surely fit to be observed, in this very month, which was November, '47, and I BELIEVE UPON THAT VERY DAY AS WE SAT AMONG THESE BARBAROUS MOUNTAINS, his brother and Miss Graeme were married. I am the least superstitious of men; but the hand of Providence is here displayed too openly not to be remarked. (5) ...|$|R
