40|$|This study {{attempts}} to reconcile two papers that provide contradictory {{findings on the}} cross-sectional relation between news coverage and expected stock returns. I first identify elements of their research designs that {{may be responsible for}} their discrepancies and then directly examine the existence of news coverage premium using Ravenpack data. I find that stocks <b>with</b> little <b>news</b> coverage earn higher returns than stocks <b>with</b> high <b>news</b> coverage even after controlling for well-known risk factors, but stocks <b>with</b> zero <b>news</b> coverage do not seem to outperform stocks <b>with</b> high <b>news</b> coverage. My findings suggest that the news coverage premium may be sensitive to the time period of the analyses as well as the presence of market crashes...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a {{historical}} {{setting in which}} expected litigation costs were low (i. e., Australia, from 1993 to 1996) to investigate whether companies <b>with</b> good <b>news</b> {{were more likely to}} preempt annual earnings than their counterparts <b>with</b> bad <b>news.</b> Empirical tests compare the probability of preemption conditional on having good <b>news</b> <b>with</b> the probability of preemption conditional on having bad news. The models control for other potential determinants of disclosure policy that have been documented in the literature. The results do not support the research hypothesis that companies <b>with</b> good <b>news</b> were more likely to preempt annual earnings than companies <b>with</b> bad <b>news.</b> This finding suggests that there may be other factors driving disclosure of bad news, in addition to those acknowledged in the extant literature. The evidence also indicates that in Australia during the investigation period, the probability of preemption was positively associated with firm size and analyst following and differed as a function of industry membership. 24 page(s...|$|R
