40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the 1990 and 1993 SIPP to examine the labor market {{experience}} of <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. We first examine wage differentials between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> and without disabilities after providing detailed controls for job conditions. We next {{examine the relationship between}} wages and the prevalence of persons with disabilities in an occupation. The final section of the paper examines job mobility differences between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> and without disabilities. We find that there is a relatively large wage differential between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> and without disabilities that appears to have increased between 1990 and 1993 for males. This differential is relatively unaffected by the addition of detailed occupational characteristics. The paper also finds support for the quality sorting hypothesis, which suggests the proportion of <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> disabilities in an occupation is capturing unmeasured ability within occupations. Finally, we find that there are relatively few differences in mobility patterns across disability status. We do find, however, that <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> disabilities are more likely to make involuntary job changes than nondisabiled workers suggesting there may be employer prejudice in terminations or that there is a higher likelihood of job mismatch among <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> disabilities.

40|$|Do wage {{differences}} between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> {{high and low}} levels of education, between males and females and between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> different levels of experience reflect differences in productivity? We address this set of questions {{on the basis of a}} data set with variables for individual <b>workers</b> matched <b>with</b> a comprehensive data set for manufacturing plants in Norway for the period 1986 - 93. The results suggest that <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> higher education tend to be more productive, roughly in accordance to their wage premium. Female workers are cet. par. found to be less productive than male workers, and this is reflected in their wages. Experienced workers are on average found to be more productive.
