25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is {{what a lot of people}} seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E
25|$|The first limited-over {{international}} match {{took place}} at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but {{turned out to be}} immensely popular. limited-over internationals (LOIs or ODIs—one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I {{have to be able to}} sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

One {{of the main}} comments with the initial dbDOS 1.0 product <b>was</b> that end-users <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manage the shortcuts, they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> delete them, and they <b>wanted</b> a way <b>to</b> share them.

500|$|Kenji Kanno {{has noted}} that the {{gameplay}} in the Crazy Taxi series has otherwise not [...] "evolved" [...] with each new game [...] "because basically {{the whole point of}} the game is to have a lot of fun in a short period of time, and it's a very concentrated game. So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places – seeing how it works." [...] Kanno is considering bringing the title to newer consoles, but would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> include multiplayer features and having a time cycle within the game that would affect passengers' attitudes and the environment of the game.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's {{what a lot of people}} have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
