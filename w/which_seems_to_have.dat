5|$|Isidore's Latin, {{replete with}} nonstandard Vulgar Latin, {{stands at the}} cusp of Latin and the local Romance {{language}} of Hispania. According to the prefatory letters, the work was composed {{at the urging of}} his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa, to whom Isidore, {{at the end of his}} life, sent his codex inemendatus ("unedited book"), <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> begun circulating before Braulio was able to revise and issue it with a dedication to the late Visigothic King Sisebut.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (<b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together {{for many years in}} Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, the relationship of the picine genera has been largely clarified, and it was determined that the Antillean piculet is a surviving offshoot of proto-woodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of Picidae, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on the Head was established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, or at least not one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E

5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{mention of}} Brentford as a cricket club {{is a series}} of three four-a-side single wicket matches in 1730 when Brentford played Edwin Stead's Kent and apparently won (at least, it is known that they won the third match <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a decider).|$|E

25|$|By 1772, Arnold had {{finalized}} {{the design}} of his pocket timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement caliper, this being around 50mm in diameter, larger than a conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted detent escapement and spiral compensation curb.

25|$|The Komnenian period, {{despite almost}} {{constant}} warfare, is notable {{for the lack}} of military treatise writing, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> petered out during the 11th century. So, unlike in earlier periods, there are no detailed descriptions of Byzantine tactics and military equipment. Information on military matters in the Komnenian era must be gleaned from passing comments in contemporary historical and biographical literature, court panegyrics and from pictorial evidence.|$|E
25|$|Running from Anderson's Plantation {{across the}} hill and {{back down to the}} old {{driveway}} near to the walled garden is a wall or dyke replacing a tree lined hedge shown in 1858. The wall or dyke is very unusual in that it is made from roughly equal sized rounded whinstones and it is held together by cement. A great deal of expense and effort would have been needed to build this long section of dyke, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in place by 1911.|$|E
25|$|According to Centennial History of South Carolina Railroad, this wrote a {{new rule}} in the SCC {{operating}} manual that engineers were to remain on station at all times, {{with the aid of}} newly hired conductors to manage cars, passengers and switches. Salvageable parts from the Best Friend were later used to build the Phoenix <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> run up to the time of the American Civil War.
