40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the power of}} Algebraic Branching Programs (ABPs) augmented <b>with</b> <b>help</b> polynomials, and constant-depth Boolean circuits augmented <b>with</b> <b>help</b> functions. We relate the problem of proving explicit lower bounds in both these models to the Remote Point Problem (introduced in [3]). More precisely, proving lower bounds for ABPs <b>with</b> <b>help</b> polynomials {{is related to the}} Remote Point Problem w. r. t. the rank metric, and for constant-depth circuits <b>with</b> <b>help</b> functions it is related to the Remote Point Problem w. r. t. the Hamming metric. For algebraic branching programs <b>with</b> <b>help</b> polynomials <b>with</b> some degree restrictions we show exponential size lower bounds for explicit polynomials...|$|R

The corps was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses <b>with</b> <b>helping</b> to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing during the war.|$|E

In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen very limited work.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} <b>with</b> <b>helping</b> settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of}} a large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
