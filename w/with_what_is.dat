5|$|In 2001, a {{team at the}} Carnegie Institute of Washington {{reported}} the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks. To their surprise, the team found that the rocks from the Apollo program carried an isotopic signature that was identical with rocks from Earth, and were different from almost all other bodies in the Solar System. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from the California Institute of Technology announced that there {{was less than a}} 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures. Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth, which conflicts <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> expected if the Moon formed far from Earth's orbit or from Theia. Variations on the giant impact hypothesis may explain this data.|$|E
5|$|People in the Vanni districts {{considered}} themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula {{but the two}} groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists {{of a number of}} highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar). Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.|$|E

5|$|The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo {{combined}} to prepare Town Planning Scheme No.26 (Hamersley Development Scheme), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, {{was presented to}} both councils for consideration. A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme {{in an effort to}} prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E
