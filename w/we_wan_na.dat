The Karhunen-Lo 6 ve (KL) analysis is used to identify the dominant spatial structures and their temporal evolution for several dynamical regimes of the flames. A data analysis procedure to extract and process the boundaries of flame cells is described. It is shown how certain spatial structures are associated with certain temporal events. The existence of small scale, high frequency, turbulent background motion in almost all regimes is revealed. 1.

Its final {{goal is to be}} able to generalize, i. e. infer new instances of these relations among the concepts. On a task involving family relationships we show that LRE can generalize better than any previously published method. We then show how LRE can be used effectively to find compact distributed representations for variable-sized recursive data structures, such as trees and lists. 1 Linear Relational Embedding Our aim is to take a large set of facts about a domain expressed as tuples of arbitrary symbols in a simple and rigid syntactic format and to be able to infer other “common-sense” facts without having any prior knowledge about the domain. Let us imagine a situation in which we have a set of concepts and a set of relations among these concepts, and that our data consists of few instances of these relations that hold among the concepts. <b>We</b> <b>wan...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} claimed that eye {{movements}} are a critical or even obligatory part of explicit counting whereas here we will show that counting relies {{on a set of}} attention pointers that individuate targets of interest and specify their locations independently of eye movements. We demonstrate that explicit counting can proceed to very high numbers without error in afterim-ages where eye movements are not possible. Previous studies with afterimages had used displays too dense to allow individuation of items by attention: the displays suffered from crowding. We also show that explicit counting is defeated for displays of more than about six items in motion because there is no mechanism available to mark already-counted items and keep that marking linked to the items as they move. In this case, only the approximate number system can operate and, interestingly, this system shows fairly accurate estimates, rather than the underestimation typically seen for denser displays. EXPLICIT COUNTING How do we count the number of caps in Fig. 3. 1 ? We could quickly make a rough esti-mate without much effort [1] or, if there were only a few, we could “apprehend ” the number in a glance (subitizing [2]).

40|$|Theoretical Computer Science is blessed (or cursed?) {{with many}} open problems. For {{some of these}} questions, such as the P vs NP problem, {{it seems like it}} could be decades or more before they reach resolution. So, if we have no proof either way, what do we assume about the answer? We could remain agnostic, saying that we simply don’t know, but there can be such a thing as too much {{skepticism}} in science. For example, Scott Aaronson once claimed [Aar 10] that in other sciences P 6 = NP would by now have been declared a law of nature. I tend to agree. After all, we are trying to uncover the truth about the nature of computation and this quest won’t go any faster if we insist on discarding all evidence that is not in the form of mathematical proofs from first principles. But what other methods can we use to get evidence for questions in computational complexity? After all, it seems completely hopeless to experimentally verify even a non-asymptotic statement such as “There is no circuit of size 2100 that can solve 3 SAT on 10, 000 variables”.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{photonic}} integration {{technique is}} presented, {{based on the}} use of an indium phosphide membrane on top of a silicon chip. This can provide electronic chips (CMOS) with an added optical layer (IMOS) for resolving the communication bottleneck. A major advantage of InP is the possibility to integrate passive and active components (SOAs, lasers) in a single membrane. In this paper we describe progress achieved in both the passive and active components. For the passive part of the circuit we succeeded to bring the propagation loss of our circuits close to the values obtained with silicon; we achieved propagation loss as low as 3. 3 dB/cm through optimization of the lithography and the introduction of C 60 (fullerene) in an electro resist. Further we report the smallest polarisation converter reported for membrane waveguides ( 95 % polarisation conversion efficiency over the whole C-band and tolerant fabrication. We also demonstrate an InP-membrane wavelength demultiplexer with a loss of 2. 8 dB, a crosstalk level of better than 18 dB and a uniformity over the 8 channels of better than 1. 2 dB. For the integration of active components we are testing a twin guide integration scheme. We present our design based on optical and electrical simulations and the fabrication techniques. Introduction: The IMOS platform is based on a high refractive index contrast InP membrane, which is optically very similar to a silicon membrane and suitable for the creation of high-density, low-power PICs.
