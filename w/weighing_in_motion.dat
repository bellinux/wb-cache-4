40|$|The {{assessment}} of the structural safety of existing bridges and viaducts becomes increasingly important in many countries. Within the actions applied to the bridges, the traffic load is, in general, the most significant variable action to be considered when the ultimate limit states are under investigation. Over the last years a considerable increase in traffic loads and intensities has been observed. In this paper design traffic loads for bridges are derived based on an extensive measurement program of vehicle characteristics. Traffic load measurements were carried out in several highways using the <b>Weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>Motion</b> (WIM) system; for every vehicle, variables recorded by the system include vehicle speed, number of axles, inter axle separation, and axle and vehicle weight. Part {{of the study is}} the composition of a Non Parametric Continuous Bayesian Belief Net {{in order to be able}} to obtain insight in the several measured parameters. This model has been quantified with data from eight WIM locations in the Netherlands. It consists of 705 nodes representing univariate margins and more than 2, 300 arcs. Design loads should be derived such that they provide a sufficient safety level of the bridge; this corresponds to a bridge design using traffic loads with a return period in the order of magnitude of tens of thousands of years. Extrapolation of the <b>Weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>Motion</b> data is therefore carried out through several statistical methods. For the lane loads a probabilistic traffic flow model was constructed including axle and vehicle loads, traffic intensities, lorry distances and speeds for free and congested traffic. Results are distributed loads on single and multiple lanes for different bridge spans. The value can be used in bridge design in combination with dynamic amplification factors and factors taking into account the uncertainties in the model and the future trends...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} effective in situ measurement of the real-time strain for bridge <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> reinforced concrete bridge structures {{through the use of}} optical fiber sensor systems. By undertaking a series of tests, coupled with dynamic loading, the performance of fiber Bragg grating-based sensor systems with various amplification techniques were investigated. In recent years, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have been developed to monitor bridge deterioration, to assess load levels and hence extend bridge life and safety. Conventional SHM systems, based on measuring strain, can be used to improve knowledge of the bridge 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to resist loads but generally give no information on the causes of any increase in stresses. Therefore, it is necessary to find accurate sensors capable of capturing peak strains under dynamic load and suitable methods for attaching these strain sensors to existing and new bridge structures. Additionally, it is important to ensure accurate strain transfer between concrete and steel, adhesives layer, and strain sensor. The results show the benefits in the use of optical fiber networks under these circumstances and their ability to deliver data when conventional sensors cannot capture accurate strains and/or peak strains...|$|R

An initial evaluation of the bridge using a determinintic approach shows that the critical limit state is bending. This paper describes the statistical analysis of the SiWIM data and the traffic flow simulations performed to predict the characteristic extreme load effects to which the bridge may be subjected during its remaining lifetime. These values are compared to the magnitude obtained from a deterministic approach. The influence lines used in the simulations are the real structrual response obtained from the SiWim instrumentation and the theoretical influence line for bending moment at mid-span.

40|$|Abstract. A {{railway bridge}} {{has been the}} object of {{investigation}} since mid 2007 {{as a response to}} increasing interest in structural health monitoring (SHM) from Polish Railways. It is a typical 40 m long, steel truss structure spanning a channel in Nieporet near Warsaw. There is over 1500 similar bridges in the railway network in Poland. The integrated system consists of two components – <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> (WIM) part for identification of train load and SHM part for assessing the state of the bridge. Two aspects of wireless transmission are considered – short range (in the vicinity of the bridge, 2. 4 GHz) and far range (from the bridge to the data analysis center, GSM). The system is designed to be energetically self-sufficient, batteries are recharged by solar panels. Both the subsystems use piezoelectric strain sensors. Numerical model of the bridge corresponds well to the experimental data and provides a good starting point for considering different scenarios of simulated damage in the structure...|$|R
40|$|In Saskatchewan, recent {{transportation}} rationalization, economic development, {{and value}} added initiatives in the resource sectors are resulting in {{significant increases in}} commercial trucking. To help facilitate improved efficiency in commercial trucking, Saskatchewan Department of Highways and Transportation (SDHT) is partnering with commercial carriers to allow increased allowable weights and larger more efficient truck configurations. Unfortunately, these new commercial truck loadings do not fall within the inference of traditional load equivalency models, especially with regards to secondary roads (thin pavements and gravels).

40|$|To {{assess the}} safety of an {{existing}} bridge, the traffic loads to which it may be subjected in its lifetime need to be accurately quantified. In this paper the 75 year characteristic maximum traffic load effects are found using a carefully calibrated traffic load simulation model. To generate the bridge loading scenarios, an extensive <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> (WIM) database, from three different European countries, is used. Statistical distributions for vehicle weights, inter-vehicle gaps and other characteristics are derived from the measurements, and are {{used as the basis}} for Monte Carlo simulations of traffic representing many years. An advantage of this “long-run” simulation approach is that it provides information on typical extreme traffic loading scenarios. This makes possible a series of nonlinear finite element analyses of a reinforced concrete bridge to determine the response to typical characteristic maximum loadings. Results of the nonlinear analyses are compared to the corresponding results using Eurocode and AASHTO load models...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{accidental}} loading in {{the form}} of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) collisions to bridge supporting structures. Structures adjacent to roads are normally strong enough to resist collisions from light vehicles, while it may not be feasible for such structures to resist collisions from all HGVs (greater than 3, 5 tons). In this paper a probabilistic model is used to determine these collision forces while Bridge <b>Weigh</b> <b>In</b> <b>Motion</b> (B-WIM) measurements performed on Swedish highways form the foundation for the calculated results. The probabilistic model is evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations in which approximately 60 thousand B-WIM measurements are included. The results are compared with values given in the design codes and the implications of using codified prescriptive approaches in Eurocode 1 - 7 (CEN 2006) are discussed. It is found that the tabulated values given in the code are significantly lower than the values determined from the simulations.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of realistic traffic loadings {{is essential to}} successfully manage roads. In the Republic of Slovenia, engineers have {{tried to get a}} real number of vehicles with counting data for over 30 years now. Specifications about axle thrust and vehicle weight we estimate with TSC 06. 511. In recent years we have accumulated realistic traffic loadings with <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> systems (WIM system). WIM systems give accurate information about vehicle weight, because they weigh all the vehicles in optional traffic stream. Main reasons for difference in equivalency factor between counting data and weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems are overloaded axles and increase of traffic. These differences have influence on design traffic loadings calculation that are important for design and assessment of pavement, bridges and traffic studies. In this degree, we tried to verify these differences in road section Benedikt 3 - 0315. First we compared data (number of vehicles, equivalency factor) that we got from measurements. After that we calculated design traffic loadings. On the basis of design traffic loadings, we read graph dimensions of new asphalt pavement layers and calculate the pavement thikness- index.

50|$|Weigh {{stations}} were primarily created to collect road use taxes before IFTA created an integrated system of doing so. While taxes {{can still be}} paid at weigh stations, their primary function is now enforcement of tax and safety regulations. These include: to check freight carrier compliance with fuel tax laws; to check weight restrictions; to check equipment safety; to check compliance with Hours of Service Regulations. Weigh stations are regulated by individual state governments and therefore have vastly different requirements from state to state. They are typically operated by the state's Department of Transportation (DOT) or Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) {{in conjunction with the}} state highway patrol or state police, thus enabling enforcement of applicable laws. The federal maximum weight is set at 80,000 pounds. Trucks exceeding the federal weight limit can still operate on the country's highways with an overweight permit, but such permits are only issued before the scheduled trip and expire {{at the end of the}} trip. Overweight permits are only issued for loads that cannot be broken down to smaller shipments that fall below the federal weight limit, and if there is no other alternative to moving the cargo by truck. Permitted oversize trucks are often required to coordinate with the Departments of Transportation and law enforcement agencies of the transited states before the trip begins, as most states require oversize trucks to be escorted. Many states have <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> technology that allow a continuous flow of truck weighing.|$|R
40|$|Since April 2010 Eurocode Load Model 1 (LM 1) is the {{prescribed}} traffic load model {{to be employed}} {{in the design of}} highway bridges in the European Union (EU). Uniquely, the code permits member states to calibrate the load model, through the application of 2 ̆ 7 α-factors 2 ̆ 7 to allow for national or regional conditions. Some countries with high volumes of very heavy traffic may find that they require α-factors in excess of unity whilst other less heavily trafficked road networks may require much lesser values. The importance of accurate calibration of the α-factors is clear from a safety and economic point of view. This paper describes procedures for calibration of α-factors using <b>Weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>Motion</b> (WIM) data. WIM data allows classification of the traffic loads in individual countries, enabling the specific Gross Vehicle Weights (GVWs), axle loads and frequencies of heavy trucks to be taken into account.

Statistical Extreme Value Distributions (EVDs) are fitted to simulated results to determine characteristic load effect values using the same methodology as was employed in the calibration of LM 1 itself.
