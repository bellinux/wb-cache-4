500|$|The Croatian {{government}} {{played a}} [...] "double game" [...] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [...] "a military solution required Bosnia as an ally, but {{a diplomatic solution}} required Bosnia as a victim". Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party held important positions in the Bosnian government including the premiership and the ministry of defence, but despite this carried out a separate policy and refused for the HVO to be integrated into ARBiH. Jerko Doko, the Bosnian defence minister, gave the HVO priority in the acquisition of military weapons. In January 1992, Tuđman had arranged for Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) who favored cooperating with the Bosniaks towards a unified Bosnian state, to be ousted and replaced by Mate Boban, who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A rift existed in the party between Croats from ethnically mixed areas of central and northern Bosnia and those from Herzegovina. Milivoj Gagro, prewar Croat mayor of Mostar and ally of Kljuić said: [...] "The secessionist policy [...] was consistently supported by the Herzegovina side, not by Sarajevo, Posavina, or Central Bosnia Croats. [...] Croats from Central Bosnia and Posavina, {{as well as those}} from urban centers who lived with Muslims and Serbs, thought differently. But when the war picked up, Posavina Croats were attacked, Sarajevo was surrounded [...] Kljuić was sidelined and Boban came in with idea [...] in this area. [...] When they [...] felt they could not survive any more they lifted their hands and accepted their fate. And the Herzegovina Croats promised them the stars in the sky and told them [...] "come here and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a place." [...] And what happened? It resulted in an exodus. And all these miserable Croat refugee communities that look absolutely ugly." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1908, much of {{the vigor}} and {{determination}} {{that went into the}} organization of the Association gradually died out due to a combination of internal and external complications. Most notably, the unfavorable land tenure system, the indolent and indifferent farmer, financial inability, and trust opposition all succeeded in the delay of progressive action. One of the most discouraging obstacles that the Association faced was the independent farmer who asserted his independence by refusing to join the association. These nonmembers, or [...] "hillbillies," [...] believed a better price could be obtained by refusing to join the association, and, in many instances, actually succeeded in obtaining significantly higher prices from the ATC representatives due to the shortage of tobacco. One representative of the American Tobacco Company remarked: [...] "What is the use of going into the association? <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> as good and better prices than they can get for you {{and there will be no}} commissions or expenses. Sell to us direct, here is the cash for you now!" [...] Consequently, this refusal of cooperation would ultimately result in the deterioration of the public’s opinion of the Planters’ Protective Association.|$|E
