Imagine, for example, {{that we have a}} system of free (i.e. non-interacting) particles, to which an attractive interaction is introduced. Depending on the form of the interaction, this may create an entirely new set of eigenstates corresponding to groups of particles bound to one another. An example of this phenomenon may be found in conventional superconductivity, in which the phonon-mediated attraction between conduction electrons leads to the formation of correlated electron pairs known as Cooper pairs. When faced with such systems, one usually turns to other approximation schemes, such as the variational method and the <b>WKB</b> <b>approximation.</b> This is because there is no analogue of a bound particle in the unperturbed model and the energy of a soliton typically goes as the inverse of the expansion parameter.

We justify an approximation by a weak Zakharov equation for times O(1) and an approximation by a Davey-Stewartson equation for times O(| log ε|). Our key observation is that the Euler-Maxwell exhibit transparency properties, similar to the properties exhibited by Joly, Métivier and Rauch for Maxwell-Bloch systems. These properties imply in particular that in a weakly nonlinear regime, the geometric optics approximation is given by a linear equation. ...|$|R

This numerical experiment, taken together with recent numerical experiments [17, 18], speaks directly to the viability of this approach; in particular, our experiment suggests a value for the rate of convergence of the WKB eigenvalues to the true eigenvalues in the semiclassical limit. This information provides some hint as to how these approximations might be rigorously incorporated into the asymptotic analysis of the singular limit for the associated nonlinear partial differential equation.
