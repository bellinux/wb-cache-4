25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the material, providing additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see Closed-cell PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a <b>wide-format</b> <b>printer.</b> These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E

50|$|Since frescography {{is based}} on digital {{printing}} methods, various materials ranging from canvas, ceramics, or glass to PVC, depending on the material the printer supports. One {{of the most commonly}} used materials is Digimura FINO 300gsm. This is mainly due to its fine-grain surface finish, which is ideal for both high-end graphics and art photography. The paper's fine raised rivulets also make it extremely well-suited to frescographies in large spaces and ambient backdrops. Commonly frescographies are printed on <b>Wide-format</b> <b>printers</b> such as Efi's Vutek printer.|$|R
5000|$|FlexiSign is a {{software}} package {{designed for the}} commercial sign and print industry. It is designed for generating graphics to be cut using a vinyl plotter or printer {{using a variety of}} sign industry related <b>wide-format</b> <b>printers.</b> Later versions of the software incorporate a number of features found in Raster editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. These features help to utilize some of the advancements in wide-format digital printing, earlier releases of the software were geared more towards vector art for vinyl plotters. As of January 2013, the latest Flexi line of products was Version 11.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} type of ink drying that most {{printers}} are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm long, wrapping {{back and forth across}} the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying solvent inks, many <b>wide-format</b> <b>printer</b> cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.|$|E
40|$|Textile {{printing}} {{has a long}} history. The {{development of}} digital textile printing changes the current textile printing business model. The introduction of digital textile printing increases in flexibility for short runs production and provides quick response to the changing market demands. The trend in digital textile printing development is to link up computer-aided design system, image scanning system, colour match prediction system and <b>wide-format</b> <b>printer</b> into an integrated system. The {{purpose of this study}} is to discuss the position of digital textile printing in textile and apparel industries. The current worldwide textile printing market was reviewed. The customers’ expectation on textile printing products and the possible market sectors of digital textile printing were stated. The future developments and limitations of digital textile printing were mentioned. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|Educational Media Services {{produces}} poster sessions as a continuous- roll print {{referred to}} as a “window shade ” or rollout poster. Poster sessions can be designed by Media Services staff with your content, or if you choose to design your own poster, you can use Powerpoint to assemble your content for proofing and printing on the <b>wide-format</b> <b>printer</b> in Media Services. Poster printing is offered in high-resolution color (720 x 720 dpi) on either semi-gloss or glossy paper. Posters can be of varying lengths and up to 48 inches high. The continuous roll prints can be conveniently carried to meetings in a large mailing tube or other lightweight container. It is strongly suggested that a small version of your poster be printed to proof all the design elements including fonts, placement, scans, and alignment. You may also want an additional small print for office or lab display. Allow about three days production time for proofing, printing and any finishing necessary. Full design services will take an additional couple days. Printing to semi-gloss paper costs $ 9. 50 per square foot, and printing to glossy paper costs $ 15. 00 per square foot...|$|E
25|$|Frescography is {{a method}} for reproduction/creation of murals using digital {{printing}} methods, invented in 1998 by Rainer Maria Latzke, and patented in 2000. The frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. CAM software programs then allow to enter the measurements of a wall or ceiling to create a mural design with low resolution motifs. Since architectural elements such as beams, windows or doors can be integrated, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural. Once a design is finished, the low resolution motifs are converted into the original high resolution images and are printed on canvas by <b>Wide-format</b> <b>printers.</b> The canvas then {{can be applied to}} the wall in a wall-paperhanging like procedure and will then look like on-site created mural.|$|R
50|$|Unlike woodblock printing, the frescography {{is based}} on {{digitally}} cut-out motifs which are stored in a database. To avoid having to work with high-resolution files on software such as Photoshop (resulting in long rendering and processing time), new CAM software programs like the Dreamworlds Design Studio allow the composition of mural designs by working with preview files which are later converted to the original resolution. By adding the exact measurements of a wall when starting a new project and even taking architectural elements such as doors windows or beams into consideration, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural.Once a design is finished, the low-resolution motifs are converted into the original high-resolution images and are printed on <b>wide-format</b> <b>printers.</b> Unlike the woodblock print consisting of stripes, the frescography is printed on {{a single piece of}} canvas, allowing a seamless mural tailor-fit to the walls dimensions. Once produced, the canvas is applied to the wall in a wall-paper-like procedure.|$|R
50|$|The plotter is a {{computer}} printer for printing vector graphics. In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, though they have generally been replaced with <b>wide-format</b> conventional <b>printers.</b> A plotter gives a hard copy of the output. It draws pictures on a paper using a pen. Plotters are used to print designs of ships and machines, plans for buildings and so on.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The wide-format inkjet {{printing}} machine {{is a typical}} electromechanical integration equipment, whose designing process is difficult,and it has high requirements for the design process and the reliability. ANSYS modal analysis is a modern analysis method for the dynamic characteristics,which is {{used to determine the}} vibration characteristics of the designing structure and the machine parts. 3 -D modeling software UG was applied for three-dimensional solid modeling of the <b>wide-format</b> inkjet <b>printers.</b> The vibration characteristics of the machine could be gotten by the ANSYS modal analysis of the model built in UG. The analysis result could be used to test whether the design agency would resonance with the environment,resulting in further mechanism modification to ensure the system stability...|$|R
