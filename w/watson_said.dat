5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> {{that he wanted to}} show three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next door with his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry. When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson. Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scully, Timmins and Willis families have moved {{in and out of the}} street over the years.|$|E
5|$|The show's storylines {{concern the}} {{domestic}} and professional {{lives of the}} people who live and work in Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-sac, and its neighbouring area, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar, hotel, cafe, police station, lawyers' office and park. Neighbours began with three families created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted to show three families who are friends living in a small street. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing rivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured are real and the residents allow the production to shoot external scenes in their yards. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill.|$|E
25|$|Watson's {{comments}} {{drew attention}} and {{criticism in the}} UK. <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> his intention was to promote science not racism, {{but some of the}} UK venues canceled his appearances. Watson canceled the rest of his tour.|$|E
5000|$|Responding to {{subsequent}} media criticism, {{the counsel}} assisting, Geoffrey <b>Watson</b> SC, <b>said</b> that [...] "at a personal level" [...] {{he was sorry}} that his questions had unexpectedly resulted in O'Farrell's resignation.|$|R
60|$|This {{proposal}} {{was accepted by}} the lads of Nos. 11 and 12, and soon {{nearly all of them}} were at work over their lessons. The exception was Luke <b>Watson,</b> who <b>said</b> he was ahead in his studies for once.|$|R

25|$|Emma <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> that David Yates {{liked to}} push his cast and crew to {{physical}} and emotional extremes, with Gary Oldman confirming Yates' preference for working slowly by shooting numerous takes {{to get the best}} performances from his cast. Yates has been influenced by such directors as Steven Spielberg, David Lean, and Ken Loach. Yates' style of work includes social and political themes, character-driven narratives, realism, and atmospheric drama.|$|E
500|$|Paul <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> {{he was not}} {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, {{as well as the}} role of the Japanese in the deaths. <b>Watson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E
500|$|Following her death, it snowed in Montreal {{for four}} days. Lhasa {{collaborator}} Patrick <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> {{that some of}} her friends {{felt it was a}} last message from her, and with experimental group Esmerine he co-wrote a song dedicated to Lhasa: [...] "Snow Day for Lhasa".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{an order}} from Maine for a 50-horsepower engine, Thomas A. Watson and Frank O. Wellington decided to build boats, which came after realizing the {{profitability}} of the enterprise {{as the result of}} building their first ship, the Barnacle, which was fitted with local furnishings. <b>Watson</b> later <b>said</b> of this decision: ...|$|R

50|$|On April 4, angry {{fishermen}} used axes {{to cut the}} {{mooring lines}} of the Farley Mowat, in St-Pierre where it was tied up. According to a fisherman, the ropes were cut because the fishermen of St-Pierre did not accept what Paul <b>Watson</b> had <b>said.</b> There had first been a confrontation between the activists and the fishermen.|$|R
500|$|Whalley is a winger but {{can also}} play as a striker. On his arrival at Southport, manager Liam <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Shaun will fit right into out style of play and with the players we have here". Whalley's former {{teammate}} Paul Mullin described him as [...] "an absolute express-train down the wings", {{and said that he}} possessed good ability on the ball.|$|E
500|$|In a {{response}} to the episode, Paul <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> he was not offended by the portrayal, and was glad the show brought the issue of illegal whaling to a large audience. The episode also featured references to the show Deadliest Catch and a rendition of the Lady Gaga song [...] "Poker Face" [...] sung by Eric Cartman on the game Rock Band. A downloadable version of the song was released for the game in March. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] was released on DVD and Blu-ray {{along with the rest of}} the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010. The episode was nominated for a Genesis Award, but lost to the Family Guy episode [...] "Dog Gone".|$|E
500|$|George Salmond was Scotland's first ODI captain, {{leading his}} {{team in the}} 1999 World Cup. In the {{intervening}} years between the World Cup and Scotland gaining ODI status in 2006, the captaincy had passed on to Craig Wright. After his team were knocked out of the 2007 World Cup in the first round, Wright resigned the captaincy. He was replaced by Ryan Watson. <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> Wright was a hard act to follow and he intended [...] "to pick up where Craig left off, bring in some of my own ideas and hopefully achieve {{the same level of}} success". Early in 2009, after Scotland failed to qualify for the 2011 World Cup, Watson stepped down as captain and was replaced by Gavin Hamilton.|$|E
40|$|In {{his address}} on the {{treatment}} of breast cancer, delivered in 1894 before the Harveian Society of London, W. <b>Watson</b> Chayne <b>said</b> of breast cancer: the “subject cannot be too often brought before the notice of the medical public. First, because the disease is common, at any rate in certain regions, {{and seems to be}} becoming more so”(Cheyne 1894). Although...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't bother {{about them}} much, you know," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Watson.</b> [...] "Carter's {{not a bad}} sort. We have him to dine now and then. All the rest are awful bounders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Came away {{between two}} days, I'll bet," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Watson.</b> [...] "And as fer the woman, why should her mail come under another name from his? Does {{that look like}} she was his daughter?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} received well by critics. The New York Times highlighted Heath's Grammy Award-nominated What If We album {{as one of}} the best Grammy nominees in Christian music that year, saying; [...] "Mr. Heath's sense of wonder is firmly intact — 'Give Me Your Eyes,' which is nominated for best gospel song, is a breezy statement of humble devotion." [...] The song was featured on USA Todays top ten [...] "pick of the week" [...] playlist in the beginning of March 2009; the magazine's editor and music critic Brian Mansfield said, [...] "Grammy and Dove Award nominations are attracting a second look for Heath's song about seeing life's big picture." [...] Jesus Freak Hideout's Matthew <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> of Heath's future music efforts: [...] "it could be really outstanding if he sticks to more upbeat songs like 'Give Me Your Eyes'." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} towards Lucas' {{development in}} the ninth series. Metro's Keith <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> that the scene had a [...] "touch of Don Draper about it," [...] {{one of the factors}} that [...] "Spooks has still got its hooks in." [...] Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph reflected on the [...] "dramatically provided" [...] twist, stated [...] "just as we were finally beginning to trust him." [...] Vicky Frost of The Guardian stated that Spooks was [...] "looking a bit lacklustre," [...] but now [...] "seems to have raised its game" [...] because of several developments for series nine, including the closing scenes involving Lucas and Vaughn, and his relationship with Dimitri Levendis. The Daily Mail Weekend Magazine stated [...] "will he really {{turn out to be a}} bad guy? It wouldn't be the first time," [...] mirroring Armitage's statement that [...] "baddies are always the most fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Watson's {{performance}} {{was characterized by}} some quirks. In one instance, Watson repeated a reworded version of an incorrect response offered by Jennings. (Jennings said [...] "What are the '20s?" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1920s. Then <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Whathe 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of [...] "What is leg?" [...] after Jennings incorrectly responded [...] "What is: he only had one hand?" [...] to a clue about George Eyser (the correct response was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E
50|$|The South African {{government}} <b>said</b> <b>Watson</b> {{would be}} recognised for his excellent contribution towards {{the creation of}} non-racial rugby and his stand {{in the struggle for}} the creation of a non- racial, non-sexist and democratic society.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where I was at school, Lord Hampstead," [...] Marion answered, [...] "we {{were kept}} in strict leading-strings. Fancy, father, what Miss <b>Watson</b> would have <b>said</b> if we had used any word in a sense not used in a dictionary." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 2011 {{election}} campaign, anonymous brochures {{were distributed}} throughout the electorate claiming Watson was not fit to hold office. The material claimed of Watson that a, [...] "recent background of infidelity, deception, lies and immoral conduct precedes this person" [...] - claims Watson denied [...] "unreservedly". <b>Watson</b> later <b>said</b> she believed she knew who had published the brochures and that neither the Liberal Party or a factional Labor opponent had {{been responsible for the}} material.|$|R
500|$|In [...] "The Coon", Butters {{suspects}} heavyset comedian Bruce Vilanch is Cartman's superhero {{alter ego}} {{based on his}} physique. After the episode aired, Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone thanking them for referring to him. Shortly after [...] "Whale Whores" [...] aired, Paul <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> he was not offended by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad South Park brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter, and the Japanese role in it, to a large audience. After Billy Mays appeared in [...] "Dead Celebrities", his son Billy Mays III said he loved the episode and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, the stars of Ghost Hunters who were also mocked in [...] "Dead Celebrities", said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their Twitter accounts. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] originally aired, Glenn Beck discussed the episode on his radio program and said he took the parody as a compliment. The Jonas Brothers' publicist specifically forbade reporters from asking the band members about their portrayal in [...] "The Ring". Nevertheless, Nick Jonas said, [...] "We are always open {{to make fun of}} ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s {{fourth season}} pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics to remind me why I love Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything it can {{to ensure that the}} real world still matters and that the audience understands the negative consequences of a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t shy away from the fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|St. Anger {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; the album holds {{a score of}} 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying: [...] "While it's an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion {{for the first time}} in years." [...] Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like [...] "a band jamming together in a garage for the first time, and the band just happened to be Metallica." [...] Talking about the album, Greg Kot of Blender said, [...] "It may be too late to rehabilitate Metallica's image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage." [...] Writing for NME, Ian <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> that: ...the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. You get the sense that, as with their emotional selves, they've taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There's no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a [...] "punishing, unflinching document of internal struggle—taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield's brain. St. Anger is an immediate record." [...] Barry Walter of Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in [...] "St. Anger", stating: [...] "No wonder there's an authenticity to St. Anger's fury that none of the band's rap-metal followers can touch." [...] He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: [...] "There's no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should cut}} the concern," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Watson,</b> [...] "and take to {{stagging}} in Surrey." [...] This {{was supposed to}} be the bitterest piece of satire that could be uttered in regard to the halcyon country in which their operations were carried on.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Labor Government, a series of {{investigations}} at the Independent Commission Against Corruption, found that Keneally ministers Eddie Obeid, Joe Tripodi, Ian McDonald had acted corruptly. [...] Counsel assisting the inquiry, Geoffrey <b>Watson,</b> SC, <b>said</b> in 2012 of investigations into the actions taken by the men in 2010 that these inquiries were the most important investigation ever undertaken by the ICAC and that there was corruption on a scale probably unexceeded {{since the days of the}} Rum Corps.|$|R
5000|$|Watson {{appeared}} in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on 16 November. He did not enter a plea and made an application for bail. The bail hearing was adjourned, pending a psychiatric report on Watson, and he was remanded in custody. <b>Watson</b> reportedly <b>said</b> to police {{that he had been}} [...] "inspired by the recent arrests of terrorist suspects in southern states," [...] and he subsequently had two applications for bail denied on the basis that there was a risk that he would reoffend.|$|R
2500|$|Former Able Seaman {{and retired}} Royal Navy {{instructor}} Henry James Plummer also served aboard Venturer {{during the war}} with both Launders and Watson. [...] Himself decorated ("Awarded for Courage, Cheerfulness, and Alertness"), <b>Watson</b> <b>said</b> of Launders: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{woman who}} was interviewed by {{sociologist}} Helen <b>Watson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Facing up to the crime and {{having to deal with}} it in public is probably worse than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, <b>Watson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{turned against}} the left wing because they don't like {{genetics}}, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life {{to be due to}} the evil system." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 28, 2001, Enron's two worst-possible {{outcomes}} came true: Dynegy Inc. unilaterally disengaged {{from the}} proposed {{acquisition of the}} company, and Enron's credit rating was reduced to junk status. <b>Watson</b> later <b>said</b> [...] "At the end, you couldn't give it [...] to me." [...] The company had very little cash with which to operate, let alone satisfy enormous debts. Its stock price fell to $0.61 {{at the end of}} the day's trading. One editorial observer wrote that [...] "Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reportedly the {{original}} decision was revisited after Erasmus met with Luke's father, Dan Watson, to discuss [...] "the role that he Watson should {{play in the}} Stormers' side”. Dan <b>Watson</b> allegedly <b>said</b> [...] "that he {{had no problem with}} Luke not captaining the side, provided Schalk Burger did not have a higher profile" [...] than Luke. Erasmus was said to be concerned that Burger, despite his star status, should not be treated differently from his teammates. Previously Erasmus had opined that a good leader does not polarize opinion, and does not make waves or headlines.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{use such}} vile {{language}} to me," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Watson.</b> [...] "You see my bruised and bleeding face? You did that, with that right hand of yours. You hit me twice--biff, biff. It is a brutal and unprovoked assault. I am {{in danger of}} my life. I must protect myself." ...|$|R
