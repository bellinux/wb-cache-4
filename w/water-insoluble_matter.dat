It also characterizes the chemical and mineralogical composition and offers {{an explanation of the}} different composition of the bottom "active" and top "inactive" layers. It was found that if the slag contains "active" components {{in the form of a}} disordered gehlenites it can be easily reprocessed by alkaline activation into valuable, stable and <b>water-insoluble</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} relationship between sucrose (Suc) accumulation and carbon partitioning {{was investigated in}} developing sugarcane internodes. Radiolabeling studies on tissue slices, which contained Suc concentrations ranging from 14 to 42 % of the dry mass, indicated that maturation coincided with a redirection of carbon from <b>water-insoluble</b> <b>matter,</b> respiration, amino acids, organic acids, and phosphorylated intermediates into Suc. It is evident that a cycle of Suc synthesis and degradation exists {{in all of the}} internodes. The decreased allocation of carbon to respiration coincides with a decreased flux from the hexose pool. Both the glucose and fructose (Fru) concentrations significantly decrease during maturation. The phosphoenolpyruvate, Fru- 6 -phosphate (Fru- 6 -P), and Fru- 2, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru- 2, 6 -P 2) concentrations decrease between the young and older internodal tissue, whereas the inorganic phosphate concentration increases. The calculated mass-action ratios indicate that the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and Fru- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase reactions are tightly regulated in all of the internodes, and no evidence was found that major changes in the regulation of any of these enzymes occur. The pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase reaction is in apparent equilibrium in all the internodes. Substrate availability might be one of the prime factors contributing to the observed decrease in respiration...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determination}} of <b>water-insoluble</b> light absorbing <b>matter</b> in rainwater has been developed. After collection the rainwater samples were filtered using polycarbonate membrane filter in the laboratory. After drying the filter in filtered air, {{the amount of}} <b>water-insoluble</b> light absorbing <b>matter</b> (soot) on the filters was determined with photometry at a wavelength of 555 nm. The precision for the method was better than 10 % calculated as relative standard deviation. The overall loss of soot due to adsorption during collection and filtration was 22 &plusmn; 2 %. The detection limit was estimated to 0. 025 in optical density, or 2 ng/ml expressed as a concentration assuming a filtration volume of 30 ml. Analysis of environmental samples have been successfully performed with the described method at the Maldives Climate Observatory Hanimaadhoo and Nepal Climate Observatory. At Maldives the average soot concentration in rain was 0. 048 μg/ml and at the Nepal obseravtory 0. 086 μg/ml...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{principal}} {{sources and}} sinks over eastern North Atlantic waters were studied through the deployment of an aerosol chemistry gradient sampling system. The chemical gradients of primary and secondary aerosol components – specifically, sea salt (SS), <b>water-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WIOM), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM), nitrate, ammonium, oxalate, amines, methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) – were examined in great detail. Sea salt fluxes were estimated by the boundary layer box model and ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 5  ng m − 2  s − 1 over the wind speed range of 5 – 12  m s − 1 and compared well with the derived fluxes from existing sea salt source parameterisations. The observed seasonal pattern of sea salt gradients was mainly driven by wind stress {{in addition to the}} yet unquantified effect of marine OM modifying fractional contributions of SS and OM in sea spray. WIOM gradients were a complex combination of rising and waning biological activity, especially in the flux footprint area, and wind-driven primary sea spray production supporting the coupling of recently developed sea spray and marine OM parameterisations...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{were collected}} in separate fine (2. 5 μm) size fractions in the period December 2006 –March 2007 at Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean. A major objective {{of the study was}} to assess biogenic impact on the marine aerosol. The samples were analysed for organic carbon, water-soluble organic carbon, major inorganic ionic species, and organic species, including methanesulphonate (MSA), dicarboxylic acids, and organosulphates. The concentrations of sea salt, non-sea-salt sulphate, and water-soluble and <b>water-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WSOM and WIOM) were estimated. Sea salt dominated the composition of the aerosol and accounted for 83 % and 91 % of the sum of the mass of the four aerosol types in the fine and coarse size fractions, respectively. WSOM, which can serve as a proxy for biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA), accounted for only 2. 8 % of the sum of the mass of the four aerosol types in the fine size fraction. MSA was the dominating organic compound with a median concentration of 47 ng m^(− 3). The organosulphates were characterised as sulphate esters of hydroxyl acids and a dihydroxylaldehyde, which may originate from the oxidation of algal/bacterial unsaturated fatty acid residues. No evidence was found for isoprene SOA...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the size- and composition-dependent {{production}} flux {{of primary}} sea spray aerosol (SSA) particles and {{its dependence on}} environmental variables is required for modeling cloud microphysical properties and aerosol radiative influences, interpreting measurements of particulate matter in coastal areas {{and its relation to}} air quality, and evaluating rates of uptake and reactions of gases in sea spray drops. This review examines recent research pertinent to SSA production flux, which deals mainly with production of particles with r 80 (equilibrium radius at 80 % relative humidity) less than 1 m and as small as 0. 01 m. Production of sea spray particles and its dependence on controlling factors has been investigated in laboratory studies that have examined the dependences on water temperature, salinity, and the presence of organics and in field measurements with micrometeorological techniques that use newly developed fast optical particle sizers. Extensive measurements show that <b>water-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> contributes substantially to the composition of SSA particles with r 80 < 0. 25 m and, in locations with high biological activity, can be the dominant constituent. Order-of-magnitude variation remains in estimates of the size-dependent production flux per white area, the quantity central to formulations of the production flux based on the whitecap method. This variation indicates that the production flux may depend on quantities such as the volume flux of air bubbles to the surface that are not accounted for in current models. Variation in estimates of the whitecap fraction as a function of wind speed contributes additional, comparable uncertainty to production flux estimates. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|Many {{atmospheric}} {{and chemical}} variables influence the partitioning equilibrium between gas phase and condensed phases of compounds {{implicated in the}} formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The large number of factors and their interaction makes it often difficult to assess their relative importance and concerted impact. Here we introduce a two-dimensional space which maps regions of dominant atmospheric phase distribution within a coordinate system defined by equilibrium partition coefficients between the gas phase, an aqueous phase and a <b>water-insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WIOM) phase. Placing compounds formed from the oxidation of n-alkanes, terpenes and mono-aromatic hydrocarbons on the maps based on their predicted partitioning properties allows for a simple graphical assessment of their equilibrium phase distribution behaviour. Specifically, it allows for the simultaneous visualisation and quantitative comparison of the impact on phase distribution of changes in atmospheric parameters (such as temperature, salinity, WIOM-phase polarity, organic aerosol load, and liquid water content) and chemical properties (such as oxidation state, molecular size, functionalisation, and dimerisation). The graphical analysis reveals that the addition of hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups increases the affinity of aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons for the aqueous phase more rapidly than their affinity for WIOM, suggesting that the aqueous phase may often be relevant even for substances that are considerably larger than the C 2 and C 3 compounds that are typically believed to be associated with aqueous SOA. In particular, the maps identify some compounds that contribute to SOA formation if partitioning to both WIOM and aqueous phase is considered but would remain in the gas phase if either condensed phase were neglected. For example, many semi-volatile α-pinene oxidation products will contribute to aqueous SOA under the conditions of high liquid water content encountered in clouds but would remain vapours in wet aerosol. It is conceivable to develop parameterisations of "partitioning basis sets" that group compounds with comparable partitioning properties, which – when combined with data on the abundance of those groups of compounds – could serve in the simulation of SOA formation...|$|R
40|$|Fast {{pyrolysis}} {{of sewage}} sludge (SS) fbr bio-oil production is considered as a promising alternative technology instead of its less acceptable common disposal processes, including agriculture application, landfi 11, and incineration. However, high nitrogen content in SS represents a drawback of pyrolysis use due to the fbrmation of NH 3, HCN, and organic nitrogen species (ONSs), which are converted to NO. and N 20 during combustion, causing severe environmental pollution, including acid rain, the greenhouse effect, and ozone layer depletion. Great care {{should be taken to}} study the fbrmation, distribution, and chemical composition of nitrogen containing species (NCSs) in pyrolysis products of SS in order to minimize the nitrogen content in products fbr fuel use or effe ctively convert them fbr chemical us e. In chapter 3, fast pyrolysis of a SS sample, which contains a high content of nitrogen, w as investigated in a drop tub e furnac e to underst and the effects of pyrolysis temper ature and sweeping gas flow rate (SGFR) on the yields of pyrolysis products and the distributions of carbon and nitrogen. The maximum oil yield of ca. 48. 7 % (daD was ac hieved at a pyrolysis temp erature of 5 00 OC and a SGF R of 600 cm 3 /min. NH 3 was fbund to be the pre domin ant nitrogenous gas under all the conditions, and its yield incre as ed with raising pyrolysis temperature and decreasing SGFR. The significant release of NH 3 at temp erature s lower than 5 00 OC should be related to the hi gh prote in content in the sludge. The N yield in HCN was lower than 2 % during pyrolysis below 550 OC, and sharply increased to 5. 8 % at 700 OC due to thermal cracking of volatile <b>matter.</b> <b>Water-insoluble</b> nitrogen- and carbon-containing species were significantly decomposed to water-soluble ones during secondary reactions. At high temperatures, heavy hydrocarbons were mainly cracked to gaseous products, while the NCSs tended to fbrm water-soluble species. This study provides a basic insight into the nitrogen transfbrmations during fast pyrolysis of SS, which would benefit the clean utilization of SS as an energy source. In chapter 4, fast pyrolyses of SS, pig compost (PC), and wood chip (WC) were investigated in an internally circulating fluidized-bed (ICFB) to evaluate bio-oil production. The pyrolyses were perTfbrmed at 500 OC and the bio-oil yields from SS, PC, and WC were 45. 2, 44. 4, and 39. 7 % (daD, respectively. The bio-oils were analyzed with an elemental analyzer, Karl-Fischer moisture titrator, bomb calorimeter, gel permeation chromatograph, Fourier transfbrm infiTared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results show that the bio-oil from SS is rich in aliphatic and ONSs, while the bio-oil from PC exhibits higher caloric value due to its higher carbon content and lower oxygen content in comparison with that from SS. The bio-oils from SS and PC have similar chemical composition of ONSs. Most of the compounds detected in the bio-oil from WC are organooxygen species. Because of its high oxygen content, low H/C ratio, and caloric value, the bio-oil from WC is unfeasible fbr use as fuel feedstock but possible fbr use as chemical feedstock. In chapter 5, the bio-oil from the SS fast pyrolysis was separated by silica-gel column chromatography (SGCC) with different solvents, including mixed solvents, as eluants. A series of alkanenitriles (Ci 3 -Cis), alkenenitrile, oleamide, fatty acid amides, and aromatic nitrogen species were fractionated from the bio-oil by SGCC and analyzed with GC/MS and FTIR. The possible precursor and fbrmation route of ONSs detected were also discussed. Most of the GC/MS-detectable ONSs are lactams, amides, and N-heterocyclic compounds, among which acetamide is the most abundant. N-heterocyclics with 1 - 3 rings, including pyrrole, pyridine, indole, benzoimidazole, carbazole, norharman, and harman, were observed. The lactams detected include pyrrolidin- 2 -one, succinimide, phthalimide, glutarimide, piperidin- 2 -one, and 3 -isobutylhexahydropyrrolo[1, 2 -a]-pyrazine- 1, 4 -dione, all of which sho uld be fbrmed via decarb o xylation and cyc lization of y- and 6 - amino acid s. Such a procedure provides an effective approach to fractionation and identification of ONSs from bio-oil pro duced by fast pyrolysis of SS. In chapter 6, when fast pyrolysis of SS at 500 OC and SGFR of 300 cm 3 /min, triacetonamine (TAA) was detected with GC/MS as major component in the resulting bio-oil using acetone as the absorption solvent and proven to be a product from the reaction of NH 3 in the bio-oil with the absorption solvent acetone. TAA yield increased with storage time and reached a level about 28. 4 % (% sludge fed, daD after 175 h. Since the reaction ofpure NH 3 with acetone does not proceed, some species in the bio-oil must catalyze the reaction of NH 3 with acetone. TAA was isolated in a high yield (27. 9 %, daD and high purity (80. 4 %) by SGCC with different solvents, including mixed solvents, as eluants. The study revealed the possibility of SS as potential resource of TAA. 学位記番号：工博甲４１９, 学位の種類：博士（工学）, 学位授与年月日：平成２３年３月２３...|$|R
