5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, he instructed that she be shown on a Venus elegans shell.|$|E
5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked {{as one of the}} most expensive video game projects at the time, coming in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 968, {{battles between}} the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire {{commenced}} in the Principality of Capua, in the Duchy of Benevento and Apulia, and hostilities continued until 970. Both {{sides of the}} conflict made many attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Otto I intended to receive recognition of his title in Byzantium, and to clarify the borders of Western and Eastern allegiances in southern Italy. He <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, {{to a member of}} the Byzantine imperial family. Anna, daughter of the deceased Emperor Romanos II, was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was unwilling to marry off a purple-born princess (i.e. a child born to a reigning emperor). After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor John I Tzimiskes, Archbishop of Cologne Gero secured the marriage of Otto II with Theophanu, a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not, however, born to the purple.|$|E

5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of frustration with {{the small amount of}} actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E
5|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany, with imprecise boundaries. When Gustav Adolf von Götzen explored the country ten years later, {{he discovered that}} the Kingdom of Rwanda included a fertile region east of Lake Kivu. Germany <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> region, which was also claimed by Leopold II {{as part of his}} own Congo Free State (annexed by Belgium to form the Belgian Congo in 1908). To justify its claim, Germany began a policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy and supporting Tutsi chiefs; this system allowed colonisation with few European troops. Yuhi V Musinga, who emerged as king after a succession crisis following {{the death of his father}} Rwabugiri and a struggle with Belgian troops, welcomed the Germans and used them to consolidate his power. The territory became the western border of German East Africa. German rule allowed Rwabugiri's centralisation policy to continue, and the rift between Tutsi and Hutu deepened.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{supports}} {{embryonic stem}} cell research and was a co-sponsor of the 2005 Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act which was passed by both houses of Congress but vetoed by President Bush.

By large margins, the American people <b>want</b> <b>this</b> bill to pass. It is only the White House {{standing in the way of}} progress – standing in the way of so many potential cures." [...] He also voted in favor of the 2007 bill lifting restrictions on {{embryonic stem cell}} research that was passed but was also vetoed by President Bush.|$|R

Lånkebanen {{was also the first}} asphalt race track in the country. It was supplemented by Rudskogen in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In the end, France had to cede Alsace {{and part}} of Lorraine, as Moltke and his generals wanted it as a buffer.

France was also required to pay an indemnity; the indemnity figure was calculated, {{on the basis of}} population, as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon I had imposed on Prussia in 1807.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} period of dual {{service on the}} Astoria and Flushing portions, IRT and BMT trains had their own {{stopping}} marks on the platforms and the sections of the platforms were separated. Passengers had separate entrances to the platforms depending on which service they <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> set-up prevented free transfers between the trains of the two companies. This arrangement had to end when the IRT lengthened trains. The two companies worked out an agreement in which the revenues collected on those stations were shared.|$|E

25|$|Browne came up {{with the}} idea of wearing a second belt which went over his right {{shoulder}} and held the scabbard in just the spot he <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> would hook into a heavy leather belt with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other cavalry officers in the Indian Army began wearing a similar rig and soon it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, the rig was copied by Imperial and Commonwealth troops and eventually became standard issue.|$|E

25|$|Constructivist {{architecture}} {{emerged from}} the wider constructivist art movement. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's Realist manifesto which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the Commissariat for Enlightenment between those who argued for pure art and the Productivists such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who <b>wanted</b> <b>this</b> art to be absorbed in industrial production.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, {{the case}} was {{highlighted}} on national television in the crime show America's Most <b>Wanted.</b> <b>This</b> gave the case nationwide notoriety and generated several phone calls and letters with people giving clues on Kilroy's whereabouts.

Santa Fe residents raised money through garage sales and car washes to help Kilroy's family continue their search. In addition, Kilroy's parents went to the University of Texas at Austin to withdraw their son from school.|$|E
25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it <b>wanted.</b> <b>This</b> torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E
