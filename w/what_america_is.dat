The trial, therefore, must blur and soften the contours of what actually happened, and instead focus upon and magnify the roles of these eight men in particular.

5000|$|Stations of the Cross, a {{reference}} to Christ’s carrying of the cross to his crucifixion, was one of Asco’s earliest collaborations. Performed on Christmas Eve in 1971, Stations of the Cross functioned as a Vietnam war protest and poked fun at Catholic traditions. The members of Asco dressed in costumes and carried a huge cardboard cross down Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles, and subsequently a crowd of holiday shoppers gathered. Asco {{led them to the}} local U.S. Marine recruiting station, then used the cross to blockade the entrance. [...] The performance was meant to mock the Chicano mural movement by utilizing stereotypical religious iconography prevalent in Chicano Muralism. The group performed Walking Mural the following year on Christmas Eve. The members of the group appropriated stereotypical Chicano iconography into their dress, with Valdez parodying the ubiquitous Virgen de Guadalupe. This piece put Asco into a dangerous situation due to the potential for violent community reaction. Regarding this fact, Gamboa reflected that, [...] "Ether the police were {{going to take care of}} you or someone in the neighborhood was going to take care of you.

5000|$|The Congress in {{the first}} decade of the 21st century has been {{characterized}} by sometimes rather extreme partisanship, with many votes split precisely on party lines. Some analysts wonder whether fierce political infighting between Democrats and Republicans has prevented lawmakers from tackling tough issues such as global warming and deficit spending and prevented them from finding acceptable bipartisan compromises on issues. In 2009, two former secretaries of State, one Republican, one Democrat, described America in 2009 as [...] "riven with partisan bickering as we confront a range of serious threats - economic, political and military." [...] Congress, itself, has tried to make rulings to reduce partisanship; for example, H.Res.153.LTH discussed how personal choices about ethics were made on a partisan basis. Intense partisanship combined with ethics probes can be a potent concoction; for example, representative Tom DeLay was kicked out of the House based in part on his dealings with lobbyist Jack Abramoff. DeLay complained afterwards in the Washington Post about what he called the criminalization of politics: [...] "it's not bad enough now to just beat 'em in policy or let them ruin your reputation ... they've got to bankrupt you, ruin your family, put you in jail, put you in the grave and then dance on your grave," [...] said DeLay. DeLay was subsequently convicted by a jury of money laundering and conspiracy related to illegally channeling campaign finances. He was sentenced to three years in prison for his crimes. At his sentencing, the judge dismissed any notion of partisanship as having been a factor in the trial: [...] "Before there were Republicans and Democrats, there was America, and <b>what</b> <b>America</b> <b>is</b> about is the rule of law." [...] Congress can still pass bills despite intense partisan opposition, such as the recent health care overhaul.|$|E

It’s worth reminding ourselves that, after suffering the worst financial and economic crisis in several generations, we are now in the third year of economic recovery. In fact, I am hopeful that the pace of recovery will pick up {{over the next few years}} as the economy heals from the wounds of the housing crash and financial crisis. We should keep in mind that the fundamental drivers of long-run economic health—our highly skilled and educated workforce, our entrepreneurial spirit, and our cutting-edge technology—remain intact at present.

40|$|Because {{this work}} is not {{literature}} but at its most essential is a mirror of the conundrum presented by the rapidly approaching moment of Constitutional politics in our present American national life, that mirror perforce shows but a pastiche, a mosaic not yet complete, a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces keep shifting in space {{before they can be}} placed. As yet no “final answer” has appeared on any horizon to the dilemmas posed by the consequences of the Presidential actions analyzed in the Leitmotif [...] particularly the decidedly non-heroic failures to act that had such lethal consequences for so many of our beloved dead [...] and those of Our highest Federal officers {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the threatened Armageddon it was well known beforehand that Katrina posed to the United States. For example, President Bush’s abysmally inept oversight of Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff’s poor post-Katrina first-week job performance completely failed We the People and taxpayers of the United States who have invested hundreds of billions of dollars since 9 / 11 / 01 in the new Department he now manages for one purpose only: to increase the security of our own American homelands. Yet decreased homeland security is what We the People got post-Katrina throughout the Gulf Coast region [...] and especially in destroyed New Orleans. For all this, wherein lies the remedy within the larger American history saga of the societal disaster still unfolding post-Katrina all along the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast [...] and especially in destroyed New Orleans [...] since the time of gravest national need since September 11, 2001 ? After that black day now in the history books will come August 29, 2005. Throughout this work, “US” stands both 1) for the pronoun that is the appropriate objective- case reference in English to something a nominative-case “We” does, and 2) for the “U. S. ”: that is, for the “United States,” that republican democratic commonwealth Our Founding Fathers brought abruptly forth into the history of the world on July 4, 1776 [...] the one that stands for “liberty and justice for all. ” Because throughout this work “We” often stands for “We the People of the United States,” such usage of “US” remains a synchronously apt pun. Compare the resounding Words that open Our United States Constitution: We, the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America. Within Our American Constitutional context, wherein lie the appropriate “lessons learned” now for US, that Posterity? We respectfully submit that it should be naught but Our utmost goal to learn them all, to learn them well, and to learn them now. Never again must We elect or confirm in office any Federal officer capable of being so derelict in performing his sworn Constitutional duties that his passivity or incompetence either helps cause or allows to remain unmitigated an exponential increase in the harm [...] over what would otherwise have been done by a natural disaster alone [...] suffered by thousands of citizens in their own American homelands. But when to our very great shame and sorrow that is precisely what happened post-Katrina [...] especially in destroyed New Orleans [...] wherein lies the remedy now for US? And wherein lie the mechanisms by which We may ensure that appropriately accountable consequences also fall appropriately upon all Federal officers who so reprehensibly failed US? For We now know that they could scarcely be relied upon should [...] God forbid [...] there come another time of national need on their watches. No, We could never again trust any of them with even Our own personal safety: much less with that of Our Posterity. If they do not have the good grace to resign, what remedy? As We reflect where We might next best turn at Our rapidly approaching moment of American Constitutional politics, this work also offers bridging devices throughout for Our consideration, i. e., historical and literary and sacred epigraphs from American history and culture (as that developed from its roots in the Judeo-Christian religious tradition). These include the “Essay-Bridging American History Epigraphs” that end subdivisions of this work. These epigraphs are given in respectful obedience to President Ronald Reagan’s farewell injunction to US that We must do a better “job teaching our children <b>what</b> <b>America</b> <b>is</b> and what she represents in the long history of the world. ” As Santayana said, those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. As Americans everywhere now reflect on how best for Our Nation We may begin healing the deadly blights on Our American heart and soul [...] that seared the consciousness of the entire world that immediate first week post-Katrina [...] the epigraphs also allow US to reflect on Our historic conceptions of what constitutes a hero-leader, a father, and especially the Father of Our Country. Those who wish to succeed must ask the right preliminary questions. Aristotle METAPHYSICS, II (III),...|$|E
