500|$|In {{addition}} to stylistic touches, the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide: Life on the Street throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among them was the <b>white</b> <b>board</b> where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black. The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the <b>white</b> <b>board.</b> The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show, particularly through the interactions between the detectives; Levinson said of the first episode, [...] "We have to inform the audience, {{but at the same time}} you want to do it with a sense of humor so you don't seem too pretentious, in a way." [...] Several long-standing character traits were established in [...] "Gone for Goode", including Kay Howard's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton, which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together. The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real-life Detective Donald Kincaid, who was the inspiration behind Felton, and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton, as chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Howard's perfect streak is based on a similar (although shorter) lucky streak experienced by the real-life Detective Rich Garvey, who is also featured in David Simon's book.|$|E

[...] Initially the studio had intended to incorporate weapons into the game, but first developed the tow chain which would be used to transport slain Velociraptor. The use of a chain was inspired by the controversial game Carmageddon. The chain was designed to be a place-holder, {{to be replaced by a}} skinned rope. However, it was decided that the chain itself was acceptable without further modification. Plans to include additional weapons were dropped; the flail alone proved to be effective enough.|$|E

500|$|The New York Yankees {{baseball}} team {{refused to give}} Homicide: Life on the Street {{permission to use the}} Yankees logo in the episode, which Fontana said angered the writers and inspired them to portray Yankees fans in a particularly negative light. Fontana, a New York native himself, was later apologetic about this portrayal and said, [...] "I kept telling the guys they were being a little harsh on the Yankees". The names [...] "Stringfield" [...] and [...] "Doherty" [...] can be seen under Ballard's case list on the <b>white</b> <b>board.</b> The names were purposely inserted as an inside joke to Homicide fans as a reference to online rumors that cast member Melissa Leo was to be replaced by actors Shannon Doherty or Sherry Stringfield. The false rumors were actually leaked by Tom Fontana himself to keep fans guessing.|$|E
500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a <b>white</b> <b>board,</b> the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the <b>white</b> <b>board</b> using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} {{process for}} Kikuuiki was different {{to that of}} Shin-shiro, where each member worked alongside Yamaguchi in a two-person meeting, and later working on the songs together as a band. For Kikuuiki, Yamaguchi recorded each song's demo, then in a meeting the band would discuss the song's feel and emotions, listing everything on a <b>white</b> <b>board.</b> Yamaguchi would then leave the other four band members {{to work on the}} song together, while he worked on their next song. Afterwards, he would return to the studio and make suggestions on their progress on the first song. This meant that Yamaguchi had less input on Kikuuiki than on the band's previous albums, which made him feel more like the band's producer. The lessened input made Yamaguchi feel that he had come to trust each member's musical abilities much more than before. On previous albums, the members needed to compromise or give up on ideas that they had, however on Kikuuiki they found that they understood each other much better. This led to the members expressing themselves more, such as drummer Keiichi Ejima, who showcased his taste in rock music strongly in the sound he created for the album. Many songs were still being created when they were recording, unlike previous albums where songs were entirely finished before recording the final take. This meant that many spontaneous ideas were included on the album. An example of this was the band wanted to add a chorus, they collected together all the people who {{happened to be in the}} studio at the time, including their musical director. The spontaneous process led to the song [...] "Klee", written about the paintings of Swiss-German painter Paul Klee, to be recorded in a single take. Similarly, the song [...] "Coelacanth to Boku" [...] was inspired by the atmosphere of Yamaguchi's room as the album was being created. Instead of featuring repeating sounds on the album, Sakanaction decided to carefully consider how each sound-effect effected the song, and included very few repeating sounds.|$|E

60|$|Now one {{instance}} will {{be sufficient to}} show the exquisite care of Turner in this respect. On the left-hand side of his Nottingham, the water (a smooth canal) is terminated by a bank fenced up with wood, on which, just {{at the edge of}} the water, stands a white sign-post. A quarter of a mile back, the hill on which Nottingham Castle stands rises steeply nearly to the top of the picture. The upper part of this hill is in bright golden light, and the lower in very deep gray shadow, against which the <b>white</b> <b>board</b> of the sign-post is seen entirely in light relief, though, being turned from the light, it is itself in delicate middle tint, illumined only on the edge. But the image of all this in the canal is very different. First, we have the reflection of the piles of the bank, sharp and clear, but under this we have not what we see above it, the dark base of the hill, (for this being a quarter of a mile back, we could not see over the fence if we were looking from below,) but the golden summit of the hill, the shadow of the under part having no record nor place in the reflection. But this summit, being very distant, cannot be seen clearly by the eye while its focus is adapted to the surface of the water, and accordingly its reflection is entirely vague and confused; you cannot tell what it is meant for, it is mere playing golden light. But the sign-post, being on the bank close to us, will be reflected clearly, and accordingly its distinct image is seen in the midst of this confusion. But it now is relieved, not against the dark base, but against the illumined summit of the hill, and it appears, therefore, instead of a white space thrown out from blue shade, a dark gray space thrown out from golden light. I do not know that any more magnificent example could be given of concentrated knowledge, or of the daring statement of most difficult truth. For who but this consummate artist would have had courage, even if he had perceived the laws which required it, to undertake in a single small space of water, the painting of an entirely new picture, with all its tones and arrangements altered,--what was made above bright by opposition to blue, being underneath made cool and dark by opposition to gold;--or would have dared to contradict so boldly the ordinary expectation of the uncultivated eye, to find in the reflection a mockery for the reality? But the reward is immediate, for not only is the change most grateful to the eye, and most exquisite as composition, but the surface of the water in consequence of it is felt to be as spacious as it is clear, and the eye rests not on the inverted image of the material objects, but on the element which receives them. And we have a farther instance in this passage of the close study which is required to enjoy the works of Turner, for another artist might have altered the reflection or confused it, but he would not have reasoned upon it so as to find out what the exact alteration must be; and if we had tried to account for the reflection, we should have found it false or inaccurate. But the master mind of Turner, without effort, showers its knowledge into every touch, and we have only to trace out even his slightest passages, part by part, to find in them the universal working of the deepest thought, that consistency of every minor truth which admits of and invites the same ceaseless study as the work of nature herself.|$|E
