5|$|Van Gogh {{made several}} {{painting}} excursions during {{visits to the}} landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); {{a good example of}} a picturesque structure bordering the <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.|$|E
5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the <b>wheat</b> <b>fields.</b> This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E
5|$|After {{spreading}} across the United States, the remnants moved through Ontario and Quebec, producing hurricane-force wind gusts and 40ft (12m) waves along Lake Ontario. Throughout the lake, 55vessels sunk {{due to the}} storm, resulting in {{tens of thousands of}} dollars in damage. High winds caused power outages and structural damage, as well as destroyed <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> across Ontario. In Toronto, the storm killed three people and injured others.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga City Flag was {{designed}} by Mr H Ellis Tomlinson, MA, FHS and adopted in 1965. Currently, Wagga Wagga City Council holds the copyright to Tomlinson's design. The flag is officially square. The upper quarter of it contains eight stalks of wheat positioned so as to form two capital letters W on a vert (green) field. The lower quarter of {{the upper half of}} the flag contains a wavy blue line on gold (yellow) representing the river winding through the <b>wheat</b> <b>fields.</b> The lower half of the flag contains the head of a ram positioned centrally on a vert (green) field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

40|$|A four-dynamic-chamber {{system was}} {{constructed}} to measure NOx and NH 3 surface-exchange between a typical <b>wheat</b> <b>field</b> {{and the atmosphere}} in the Yangtze Delta, China. The average fluxes of NO, NO 2 and NH 3 were 79, - 5. 6 and - 5. 1 ngN/(m(2.) s), and 91, - 1. 8 and 23 ngN/(m(2.) s), respectively for the <b>wheat</b> <b>field</b> and the bare soil. The NO flux was positively correlated with soil temperature and the fluxes of NO 2 and NH 3 were negatively correlated with their ambient concentrations during the investigated period. The compensation point of NO 2 between the <b>wheat</b> <b>field</b> and the atmosphere was 11. 9 mu g/m(3). The emissions of NO-N and NH 3 -N from the urea applied to the <b>wheat</b> <b>field</b> were 2. 3 % and 0. 2 %, respectively, which indicated that the main pathway of N loss from the investigated winter <b>wheat</b> <b>field</b> was NO. Application of a mixture of urea and lignin increased the emissions of NO, but also greatly increased the yield of the winter wheat...|$|R
5|$|The Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster, Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster, is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey dorsal stripe and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, <b>wheat</b> <b>fields</b> and sunflowers.|$|E
