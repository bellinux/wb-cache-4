40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a novel magnetic <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> integrating a mechanism {{that can be}} used for lifting and stabilizing the unit. The mechanism consists of 2 active lever arms mounted on each side of the wheel and rotating coaxially with the wheel. This mechanism allows slightly lifting the magnetic wheel at any desired position on the wheel circumference and consequently decreasing the magnetic force at this specific location. The same mechanism can also be used to stabilize the wheel, when external forces are unfavorable. This paper also describes the potential of this concept for in-pipe inspection technologies. Indeed it can be used to increase the mobility of magnetic wheels robots which are currently not able to negotiate complex obstacles. At the same time, it allows building smaller robots, since the self stabilizer system allows reducing the amount of required magnetic wheels to only two units.

In order to pass obstacles, the sucker and the <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> can be pulled up and pushed down by a lifting mechanism. The magnetic adhesion force can be adjusted by changing the height of the gap between the sucker and the wall by the lifting mechanism. In order to increase the adhesion force, the value of the sucker’s magnetic energy density (MED) is maximized by optimizing the magnet sucker’s structure parameters with a finite element method. Experiments prove that the magnetic adhesion mechanism has enough adhesion force and that the WCWR can complete wall‐climbing work within a large unstructured environment...|$|E

40|$|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) based {{systems have}} {{recently}} received increasing attention {{as a viable}} alternative for meeting the residential electrical and thermal demands. However, as the intermittent demand profiles of a building can only be addressed by a tri-generative unit which can operate at partial loads, the variation of performance of the system at partial loads might affect its corresponding potential benefits significantly. Nonetheless, no previous study {{has been carried out}} on assessing the performance of this type of tri-generative systems in such conditions. The present paper is the first of a two part study dedicated to the investigation of the performance of a tri-generative system in which a PEMFC based system is coupled with a desiccant <b>wheel</b> <b>unit.</b> This study is focused on evaluating the performance of the PEMFC subsystem while operating at partial loads. Accordingly, a detailed mathematical model of the fuel cell subsystem is first developed and validated using the experimental data obtained from the plant’s and the fuel cell stack’s manufacturer. Next, in order to increase the performance of the plant, two modifications have been proposed and the resulting performance at partial load have been determined. The obtained results demonstrate that applying both modifications results in increasing the electrical efficiency of the plant by 5. 5 %. It is also shown that, while operating at partial loads, the electrical efficiency of the plant does not significantly change; the fact which corresponds to the trade-off between the increment in the gross electrical efficiency and the lower slope of decrement in the auxiliary losses. The obtained results are suitable to be employed to assess the performance of the overall tri-generative system, conducted {{in the second part of}} the study, while meeting intermittent load profiles...|$|E
40|$|Biophotonics {{techniques}} are showing {{great potential for}} practical tissue diagnosis, capable of localised optical spectroscopy as well as wide field imaging. Many of those are generally {{based on the same}} concept: the spectral information they enable to acquire encloses clues on the tissue biochemistry and biostructure and these clues carry diagnostic information. Biophotonics techniques present the added advantage to incorporate easily miniaturisable hardware allowing several modalities to be set up on the same systems and authorizing their use during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures. The work presented in this thesis aims to build on these advantages to design biophotonics instruments for tissue diagnosis. Fluorescence and diffuse reflectance, the two modalities of interest in this work, were implemented in their single point spectroscopic and imaging declinations. Two “platforms”, a spectroscopic probe setup and an optical imaging laparoscope, were built; they included either one of the two aforementioned modalities or the two of them together. The spectroscopic probe system was assembled to detect lesions in the digestive tract. In its first version, the setup included a dual laser illumination system to carry out an ex vivo fluorescence study of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) in the mouse model. Outcomes of the study demonstrated that healthy livers could be distinguished from NAFLD livers with high classification accuracy. Then, the same fluorescence probe inserted in a force adaptive robotic endoscope was applied on a fluorescence phantom and a liver specimen to prove the feasibility of recording spectra at multiple points with controlled scanning pattern and probe/sample pressure (known to affect the spectra shape). This approach proposed therefore a convincing method to perform intraoperative fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence setup was subsequently modified into a combined fluorescence/diffuse reflectance spectroscopic probe and demonstrated as an efficient method to separate normal and diseased tissue samples from the human gastrointestinal tract. Following the single point spectroscopy work, imaging studies were conducted with a spectrally resolved laparoscope. The system, featuring a CCD/filter <b>wheel</b> <b>unit</b> clipped on a traditional laparoscope was validated on fluorescence phantoms and employed in two experiments. The first one, building on the spectroscopy study of the gastrointestinal tract, was originally aimed at locating tumour in the oesophagus but a lack of tissue availability prevented us from doing so. The system design and validation on fluorophores phantoms were nevertheless described. In the second one, the underarm of a pig was imaged after injection of a nerve contrast agent in order to test the feasibility of in vivo nerve delineation. Fluorescence was detected from the region of interest but no clear contrast between the nerve and the surrounding muscle tissue could be detected. Finally, the fluorescence imaging laparoscope was modified into a hyperspectral reflectance imaging laparoscope to perform tissue vasculature studies. It was first characterized and tested on haemoglobin phantoms with varying concentrations and oxygen saturations and then employed in vivo to follow the haemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation temporal evolutions of a porcine intestine subsequently to the pig’s termination. A decrease in oxygen saturation was observed. The last experiment consisted in monitoring the tissue re-oxygenation of a rabbit uterus transplant on the recipient animal, a successful tissue re-perfusion after the graft was highlighted.

40|$|Metal-organic {{framework}} (MOF) compounds as a {{new class}} of porous coordination polymers consists of metal ions or clusters linked by organic molecules. They have gained recent interest because of their large surface areas and huge variety of the porous network structures. They exhibit interesting adsorption properties and therefore are potential candidates for various technical applications. In this work, continuous wave (cw) and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods such as pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy are applied to study metal-organic frameworks with respect to different aspects of their properties: The host-guest interactions between Cu 2 + ions in [Cu 3 (btc) 2]n (HKUST- 1; btc: 1, 3, 5 -benzenetricaboxylate) with adsorbed methanol (CH 3 OH), 13 C enriched carbon monoxide and dioxide (13 CO, 13 CO 2), hydrogen (H 2), deuterium (D 2) and mixed isotopic HD. In [Cu 3 (btc) 2]n, the Cu 2 + ions are connected to binuclear Cu/Cu paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>units.</b> Since the Cu 2 + ions in the [Cu 3 (btc) 2]n are antiferromagnetically coupled, the new compound [Cu 2. 97 Zn 0. 03 (btc) 2]n is synthesized by isomorphous substitution containing about 1 % paramagnetic Cu/Zn paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>units.</b> The modified Cu/Zn paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>units</b> prove to be a very sensitive probe for the interactions with the adsorbed molecules. Secondly, the exchange interactions of antiferromagnetically coupled Cu/Cu paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>units</b> as well as additional inter-paddle wheel exchange interactions between the Cu/Cu pairs are studied in [Cu 2 (bdc) 2 (dabco) ]n, a layered MOF with 1, 4 -benzenedicaboxylate (bdc) as linker and 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane (dabco) acting as pillars between the layers. In comparison to [Cu 3 (btc) 2]n, the additional inter-paddle wheel exchange interactions are much easier disturbed by incorporation of Zn 2 + ions into the framework structure. Third, the structural dynamics of the framework is investigated in the compound [Al(OH) (bdc) ]n (MIL- 53) which was isomorphously substituted by V(III) /V(IV) species. The 51 V hyperfine structure revealed {{to be sensitive to the}} so-called breathing effect, a flexible structural behaviour upon guest adsorption/desorption or upon thermal treatment. It is shown that the aluminum ions can be substituted by vanadium but the octahedral coordination environment changes slightly to a pseudo-octahedral or a square-pyramidal coordination. Based on the hyperfine interactions between the electron spin and the nuclear spins of the surrounding atoms, structural models can be derived from orientation-selective measurements. In such a way, structural information of materials like powder samples and adsorbate complexes can be obtained which are hardly or even not accessible by other methods...|$|R
