5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} King Edward I in 1278 {{reported that there}} were at that time 94 privately owned gibbets and gallows in use in Yorkshire, including one owned by the Archbishop of York. What <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> about Halifax was that the custom lingered on there for so long after it had been abandoned elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After Molly's father died, {{her family}} {{returned}} to Canajoharie. On September 9, 1753, Molly's mother married Brant Kanagaradunkwa, a Mohawk sachem of the Turtle clan. Possibly to reinforce their connection to Brant Kanagaradunkwa, {{who was a}} prominent leader, Molly and Joseph took their stepfather's name as a surname, which <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for that time.|$|E
5|$|Eline <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in its track after {{striking}} Madagascar. Most {{storms in}} the Mozambique Channel {{turn to the}} south, ultimately missing land; however, upon landfall, Eline became one of 5% of recorded cyclones to strike southern Africa. In addition, favorable conditions allowed the storm to maintain its identity over land. Overall, Cyclone LeonEline traveled over 11,000km (6,800mi) during its 29day duration.|$|E

5|$|Fausto's {{regeneration}} {{north of}} Hawaii <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> but not unprecedented. The other time this happened since 1966 {{was in the}} 1975 season. That time, another TUTT absorbed the remnant of Hurricane Ilsa, {{which led to the}} formation of an unnamed hurricane at high latitude. Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii, but the actual formation of one is rare.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debra's {{development}} {{near the}} coast <b>was</b> <b>unusual,</b> complicating forecasting {{in addition to}} its rapid intensification and abnormal direction. The lack of ship reports and incorrect information received from those that were received further complicated Debra's forecasts. However, due to its formation close to the coast, Debra had inadequate time to cause a greater storm surge. Debra's floods accounted for most of the month's rainfall.|$|E

5|$|In 1333–34, {{an attempt}} by some {{dissatisfied}} Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in western European countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete {{another edition of}} Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses. It <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for books of this size and ambition to go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{decided to}} convert the Jews in Hungary to Catholicism around 1360. After {{experiencing}} resistance, he expelled them from his realms. Their immovable property was confiscated, but {{they were allowed to}} take their personal property with them and also to recover the loans they had made. No pogrom took place, which <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in Europe in the 14th century, according to historian Raphael Patai.|$|E

5|$|Openly gay Mattachine Society {{president}} Hal Call, Mattachine {{executive secretary}} Donald Lucas and Mattachine treasurer Les Fisher spoke for gay men. The Rejected <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for its time {{in that it}} included actual gay people as opposed to only presenting ostensibly heterosexual experts.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} crewed by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer in the rear seat. The accident flight crewing <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in several respects.|$|E

5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> because although theoretically staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E
5|$|The castle's layout <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for {{the region}} during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location {{and the power of}} its builder. In scale and design it was similar to the initial version of Rochester Castle, another major fortification built by Odo in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Laurent Boutonnat who also wrote the screenplay, and produced by RCA, and was shot for one day and cost about 5,000 francs (750–760 euro). Boutonnat wanted that the video would be filmed in cinemascope, but this <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{at the time and}} the idea was finally withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|Tristano started {{teaching}} music, especially improvisation, {{in the early}} 1940s, and by the mid-1950s was concentrating on teaching in preference to performing. He taught in a structured and disciplined manner, which <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in jazz education when he began. His educational role over three decades meant that he exerted an influence on jazz through his students, including saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Woodside {{railway station}} {{was built in}} 1871 to serve Croydon Racecourse (see below). The station <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in being {{designed}} for horses, with access ramps instead of steps and with unusually high entrances designed to accommodate a horse and rider. In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink; the station is now Woodside tram stop.|$|E
5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E
