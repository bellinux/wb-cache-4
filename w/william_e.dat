5|$|In 1954, <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Miller {{died from}} a heart attack while driving a horse at Harrington Raceway. After Miller's death, Rosecroft hosted the <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Miller Memorial race. Over the years, this race {{attracted}} several notable horses, including Cam's Card Shark, the 1994 Horse of the Year. John W. Miller, William's son, owned Rosecroft until his death in 1969. In 1961, the owners of Rosecroft resurfaced and regraded the track. Following John, Earle Brown owned the racetrack. John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, started to work at Rosecroft in 1974. Earle Brown moved to a different position at the racetrack in 1980 and <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Miller II, <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Miller's grandson, took over operations.|$|E

5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E

5|$|Colonel <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the Canadian {{astronomer}} <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Harper {{used this}} technique {{to measure the}} period of this single-line spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the orbital eccentricity as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component {{along the line of}} sight to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality. On September 18, Unionists {{shut down}} the pro-Southern Louisville Courier {{newspaper}} and arrested former governor Charles S. Morehead, who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies. Learning that Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to Prestonsburg, Kentucky, where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers George W. Johnson, George Baird Hodge, <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Simms, and William Preston. The group continued to Abingdon, Virginia, where they took a train to Confederate-held Bowling Green, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Katherine Merry Devine, 14, was {{abducted}} on November 25, 1973, {{and her body}} was found the next month in the Capitol State Forest near Olympia, Washington. Brenda Joy Baker, 14, was seen hitchhiking near Puyallup, Washington on May 27, 1974; {{her body was found}} in Millersylvania State Park a month later. Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel that he had no knowledge of either case. DNA analysis led to the arrest and conviction of <b>William</b> <b>E.</b> Cosden for Devine's murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved.|$|E
