5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} the Hulk, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Louis Leterrier, with a screenplay by Zak Penn. It stars Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In The Incredible Hulk, a new backstory is established where Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the supersoldier program through gamma radiation. On the run, he attempts to cure himself of the Hulk before he is captured by General Thaddeus Ross, but his <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> are realized when power-hungry soldier Emil Blonsky becomes a similar, but more bestial creature.|$|E
5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{was criticized}} for his {{concentration}} on violence in his works. In the case of Native Son, people complained that he portrayed {{a black man in}} ways that seemed to confirm whites' <b>worst</b> <b>fears.</b> The period following publication of Native Son was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam. While in Chicago he visited the American Negro Exhibition with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and Claude McKay.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' <b>worst</b> <b>fears.</b> The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's {{article and}} the Court Report examine {{a variety of}} reasons for the planned revolt. Extremely {{dependent}} on slavery, many Charleston residents had been alarmed about the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that restricted slavery from expansion to the western territories, feeling it threatened the future of slavery. Some suggested that slaves had learned about the compromise and thought they were to be emancipated. Whites blamed the AME Church, they blamed rising slave literacy, and the African slaves brought from Haiti during its Revolution. In 1822, beleaguered whites in Charleston uniformly believed that blacks had planned a large insurrection; such a scenario represented their <b>worst</b> <b>fears.</b>|$|E

His past villains have entered his subconscious and if something doesn't happen soon, Jim {{will be in the}} coma forever. His super ego has been unleashed within his subconscious to stop the madness. To restore his sanity he must find the Golden Udders of lucidity. When Jim enters his subconscious, he finds out that his four mind chambers have been taken over by his <b>worst</b> <b>fears.</b> He must collect Golden Udders to unlock the other three chambers and Green Marbles to unlock the levels within the chamber. Jim defeats four villains who took over his mind chambers, and finally faces the personification of his trauma: Earthworm Kim.|$|E
25|$|The two Russian occupations {{had been}} harsh {{and were not}} easily forgotten. These occupations were a seed of a feeling of separateness and otherness, that in a narrow circle of {{scholars}} and intellectuals at the university in Turku was forming {{a sense of a}} separate Finnish identity representing {{the eastern part of the}} realm. The shining influence of the Russian imperial capital Saint Petersburg was also much stronger in southern Finland than in other parts of Sweden, and contacts across the new border dispersed the <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> for the fate of the educated and trading classes under a Russian régime. At the turn of the 19th century, the Swedish-speaking educated classes of officers, clerics and civil servants were mentally well prepared for a shift of allegiance to the strong Russian Empire.|$|E

25|$|The Polovtsian army {{returns in}} triumph singing the praise of Khan Gzak (Polovtsian March). Konchak sings of the sack of Putivl and other {{victories}} and confidently predicts {{that they will}} soon capture all of Russia. Igor and his son Vladimir have their <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> confirmed by the new captives. Vladimir and the other prisoners urge Igor to escape, but he is at first reluctant, singing of his shame and {{saying that it is}} the duty of the other Russian princes to save the homeland (Igor's Monologue, Mariinsky edition only). Ovlur now arrives to say that he has prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying. Igor urges his son to come, but Vladimir feels unable to leave Konchakovna who threatens to wake the camp. Eventually Igor flees alone and Konchakovna sounds the alarm. She and her father refuse to let the Polovtsy kill Vladimir. Instead Konchak orders the death of the guards and marries Vladimir to his daughter. As for Igor, Konchak thinks more of him for his escape.|$|E
25|$|The German {{plan for}} this sector {{called for an}} assault by {{airborne}} and shock troops to take Fort Eben-Emael and the Meuse and Albert Canal bridges, thus opening a way through the Dutch and Belgian defences for the 4. Panzerdivision (4th Panzer Division), and bring the Albert Canal defensive line to a premature collapse. Once this breach was made, General Erich Hoepner's XVI Army Corps, and Army Group B would assume control of the 4th Panzer Division, the 3rd Panzer Division and the 20th Infantry Division. Hoepner's mission was to quickly launch his Corps from the bridgehead, seize the area around Gembloux before the French infantry divisions could entrench themselves there, and by thus conforming to the <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> of the French High Command draw all modern Allied forces and their reserves to the north, away from the main thrust through the Ardennes. This would enable the German Army to cut the French First Army, the BEF and the Belgians off by a swift advance to the English Channel leading to a giant encirclement. The action was basically a feint to tie down the Allies in the north so they could {{not interfere with the}} main thrust through the Ardennes.|$|E
500|$|According to Kimmelman, {{the reason}} for their {{reluctance}} to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> {{of many of the}} interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as [...] "ungenerous" [...] and [...] "immoral".|$|E

500|$|He then concludes presciently, [...] "Some {{analysts have}} tried to paint this war as a {{conflict}} between Afghans. It isn't. In reality, it is a war between a Pakistan-supported militant group {{and the rest of}} the world. There are only two possible solutions: A Western-backed Afghan government decisively defeats the Taliban, or the Taliban agree to demilitarize and join the political process. The United States, however, should understand one thing very clearly: It would be making a huge error -- and confirming the Afghan people's <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> -- if it picked up and left Afghanistan to the Taliban's brutal ways." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2008 Olympic Games {{have been}} {{generally}} {{accepted by the}} world's media as a logistical success. Many of the <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> about the games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging), and the air quality – due largely to favorable weather patterns – was {{not as bad as}} many had feared beforehand despite being the worst in Olympics history. [...] Hopes that hosting the Games would lead to improvements in human rights protections and rule of law in China, however, went unfulfilled.|$|E

500|$|Pertaining to the above, {{it should}} be noted that Walter Brown was not rich; also that as Auerbach was as tough at the {{negotiating}} table as he was on the practice court and in the locker room, it was always for the purpose of getting the most out of his players. In the summer of 1984, with much trepidation, Auerbach reluctantly signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Then, Auerbach's <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> came true when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape, and, suffering from various injuries, provided little contribution as the team lost a playoff for the first time ever to the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. [...] Two subsequent facts are perhaps most relevant in evaluating Auerbach's legacy: First, he was able to trade Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who was a major contributor to the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last of Auerbach's career. Second, Maxwell continues to be embraced as a beloved member of the Celtics family, including having his number retired alongside the team's legendary greats.|$|E
500|$|As they read, the relatives' <b>worst</b> <b>fears</b> are soon realised; Buoso {{has indeed}} bequeathed his fortune to the monastery.

Rinuccio {{suggests}} that only Gianni Schicchi can advise them what to do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and now say that marriage to the daughter of such a peasant {{is out of the}} question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to [...] "be off" [...] and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.|$|E

A heavy downpour on 21 October confirmed the airmen's <b>worst</b> <b>fears,</b> and Lieutenant General George C.

He warned that he might have to withdraw at least two squadrons back to Australia. Major General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff at GHQ, and Brigadier General Hugh J. Casey, his chief engineer, reassured Kenney everything possible would be done to keep the airfields operational in the wet season. Additional engineer units were ordered to Port Moresby, and work on the port and the Nine Mile Quarry was handed over to the Australians.|$|E
