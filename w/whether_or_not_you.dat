500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. She felt as a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> like the content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E

Discussing the reasons for the Clinton administration's proposal to strengthen the CRA and further reduce red-lining, Lloyd Bentsen, Secretary of the Treasury at that time, affirmed his belief that availability of credit should not depend on where a person lives, [...] "The only thing that ought to matter on a loan application is <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> can pay it back, not where you live." [...] Bentsen said that the proposed changes would [...] "make it easier for lenders to show how they're complying with the Community Reinvestment Act", and [...] "cut back a lot of the paperwork and the cost on small business loans".|$|E
2500|$|Brian and Patrick {{continued}} to combat homophobia in the NHL after Brendan's death; Patrick, along with Brian Kitts and Glenn Witman, founded You Can Play {{as a tribute}} to his brother. The name You Can Play originates from a piece Patrick Burke wrote for outsports.com. In the piece, Patrick talks about the overwhelmingly positive experience surrounding Brendan's coming out: [...] "I waited to get a negative email, or to read a damning article, or to hear a snide comment at a game. I waited, and I waited, and I waited…and I got what I should have expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration." [...] He talks of letters and emails that poured in to his family, and he also talks of fellow scouts and hockey personnel pulling him aside and giving their support. He summarizes his feelings in the revelation that across the hockey world, what matters is <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> can play. [...] "If you can play, we welcome you." [...] The quote was adapted to the catchier [...] "If you can play, you can play" [...] by the campaign.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>you</b> enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E
