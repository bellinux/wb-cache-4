500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson. As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E

We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E

The songs were produced and recorded {{for the most part}} at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. At this time, the Autotune facility was not available and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards, as Wilson remembers: [...] "Because of the fact we were not using computers, we had to work them very hard.

[...] On {{the first anniversary of}} his death, McCartney played Harrison's [...] "Something" [...] on a ukulele at the Concert for George.

500|$|In {{light of}} Butcher's recruitment, Shields became a co-lead vocalist, {{splitting}} and often sharing duties alongside Butcher. Commenting on the transition, Shields noted that Butcher [...] "sounded all right {{and she could}} sing one of our songs, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to show her how to play guitar." [...] Shields was initially reluctant {{to take on a}} vocal role within the band, but said that he had [...] "always sung in the rehearsal room [...] and made up the melodies." [...] With the new line up in place, the band intended to drop the My Bloody Valentine moniker, but according to Ó Cíosóig and Shields, the band was unable to decide on a name and kept the moniker [...] "for better or for worse".|$|E

500|$|In December 2005, Radiohead asked {{producer}} Spike Stent, who {{had worked}} with artists including U2 and Björk, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told Mojo: [...] "Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they’d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'" [...] The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006. In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour {{for the first time since}} 2004; according to Yorke, [...] "We basically had all these half-formed songs, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to get it together. And rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again." [...] In May and June 2006, Radiohead toured major cities in Europe and North America and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{stated that}} Isaac Hayes' {{membership}} had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full episode which parodies Scientology. However, {{the decision to}} ultimately produce a South Park episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with Penn Jillette. Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of [...] based on Scientology, but Showtime prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology. Parker commented, [...] "We're going, That's fucked up. And hearing other people say, 'You can't do that' – you can only say 'You can't do that' so many times to Matt and me before we're gonna do it. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to tell Isaac, 'Dude, we totally love working with you, and this is nothing personal, it's just we're South Park, and if we don't do this, we're belittling everything else we've ripped on.|$|E

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
30|$|This new {{development}} will certainly change {{the landscape of}} maritime transportation in the region, if not the world. The former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, said, “It was Thailand’s right to build the canal since it is within its territories, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to make adjustment. There will be reshaping of economies {{because of the new}} accessibility, then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to find a way how to benefit from it” (Business 2002 a).

500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E
