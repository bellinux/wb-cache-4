30|$|All PET/CT {{datasets}} were reconstructed {{using the}} Monte Carlo-based full- 3 D iterative algorithm Tera-Tomo (Mediso Medical Imaging Systems, Budapest, Hungary) [19]. Raw PET data were reconstructed into 5 -min bins using reconstruction settings (4 iterations, 6 subsets, 0.4 [*]×[*] 0.4 [*]×[*] 0.4  mm 3 voxel size) {{as well as}} intercrystal scatter correction. Decay correction to injection time was applied. All reconstructed datasets were analysed using VivoQuant software (v 2.0, inviCRO, LLC, Boston, USA). Regions of interest (ROIs) for different organs (thyroid, salivary glands, stomach and bladder) were manually defined around each organ (vide infra) in order to express 18 F uptake in each organ as a standardised uptake value (SUV). The SUV was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity in each ROI (MBq) per gram of organ tissue (weighed post-mortem) and radioactivity in the whole-body ROI (MBq) per whole-body weight (excluding tail). The total radioactivity present in each organ was determined by drawing an approximate ROI encompassing the whole organ, using a threshold of 10  % of the maximum count to define {{the edge of the}} ROI. The binned images corresponding to 25 – 30  min post-injection were used for the ROI analysis. For calculations involving the thyroid, which is difficult to dissociate from trachea and <b>weigh</b> <b>accurately,</b> a previously reported standard thyroid tissue mass of 3.6  mg [15, 20] was used as the weight of the organ.|$|E

40|$|The {{disrupted}} morphology of lenses in mouse {{models for}} cataracts precludes accurate in vitro assessment of lens growth by weight. To overcome this limitation, we developed morphometric methods to assess defects in eye lens growth and shape in mice expressing the αA-crystallin R 49 C (αA-R 49 C) mutation. Our morphometric methods determine quantitative shape and dry {{weight of the}} whole lens from histological sections of the lens. This method was then used to quantitatively compare the biometric growth patterns of lenses of different genotypes of mice from birth to 12 months. The wild type dry lens weights determined using the morphometric method were comparable to previously reported weights. Next we applied the method to assessing the lenses of αA-R 49 C knock-in mice, which exhibit decreased αA-crystallin protein solubility, resulting {{in a variety of}} growth abnormalities including early cataract formation, decreased eye and lens size, failure to form the equatorial bow region, and continued lens cell death, sometimes resulting in the entire loss of the lens and eye. Our morphometric methods reproducibly quantified these defects by combining histology, microscopy, and image analysis. The volume measurement accurately represented the total growth of the lens, whereas the geometric shape of the lens more accurately quantified the differences between the growth of the mutant and wild-type lenses. These methods are robust tools for measuring dry lens weight and quantitatively comparing the growth of small lenses that are difficult to <b>weigh</b> <b>accurately</b> such as those from very young mice and mice with developmental lens defects.
