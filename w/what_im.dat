40|$|Abstract—Creation of {{a precise}} domain {{vocabulary}} {{is crucial for}} capturing the essence of any software system, either when recovering knowledge from a legacy system or when formulating requirements for a new one. Soft-ware specifications usually maintain noun notions and include them in central vocabularies. Verb or adjec-tive phrases are easily forgotten and their definitions buried inside imprecise paragraphs of text. This paper proposes a model-based language for comprehensive treatment of domain knowledge, expressed through constrained natural language phrases that are grouped by nouns and include verbs, adjectives and preposi-tions. In this language, vocabularies can be formulated to describe behavioural, declarative and conditional characteristics of a given problem domain. <b>What</b> is <b>im...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model of a}} system is an explicit description of the behaviour required of the system. Methods for {{conceptual model}}ling include entity-relationship (ER) modelling, data flow modelling, Jackson System Development (JSD) and several object-oriented analysis method. Given the current diversity of modelling methods, {{it is important for}} teaching as well as using these methods to know what the relationships between them is {{and to be able to}} indicate <b>what</b> the (<b>im)</b> possibilities of integrating different methods are. This paper compares three classical modelling methods (ER, data flow, JSD) on their possibilities for integration and combination. It is shown that there is a common core of these methods, which centres around the concept of system transaction and that unifies the static view of a system taken by ER modelling, with the dynamic view taken by JSD and the functional view taken by data flow modelling. Several object-oriented analysis methods integrate these three views. This paper illustrates how this is done in the analysis stage of Object Modelling Technique. Finally, it is shown that the transaction decomposition table can be used as a pivot around which to combine different methods. The results of this paper can be used in teaching to explain the relationships and differences between the methods analysed here, and in system development practice to ease the transition from structured to object-oriented method...|$|R

40|$|<b>What</b> {{processes}} transform (<b>im)</b> mobile individuals into ‘migrants’ {{and geographic}} movements across political-territorial borders into ‘migration’? To address this question, the article develops the doing migration approach, which combines perspectives from social constructivism, praxeology and the sociologies {{of knowledge and}} culture. ‘Doing migration’ starts with the processes of social attribution that differentiate between ‘migrants’ and ‘non-migrants’. Embedded in institutional, organizational and interactional routines these attributions generate unique social orders of migration. By illustrating these conceptual ideas, the article provides insights into {{the elements of the}} contemporary European order of ‘migration’. Its institutional routines contribute to the emergence of a European migration regime that involves narratives of economization, securitization and humanitarization. The organizational routines of the European migration order involve surveillance and diversity management, which have disciplining effects on those defined as ‘migrants’. The routines of everyday face-to-face interactions produce various micro-forms of doing ‘migration’ through stigmatization and othering, but they also provide opportunities to resist a social attribution as ‘migrant’...|$|R
40|$|Gentrification is {{generally}} {{defined as the}} transformation of a working class living in the central city into middle-upper class society. It has {{both positive and negative}} consequences. Gentrification caused loses of affordable home, however, it is also beneficial because it rejuvenates the tax base as well stimulates mixed income. Question arises whether the characteristics of gentrification in developing countries will appear to be the same or varies to those in developed countries. Because of this research growth, a review of the body of literature related to the mutation of gentrification, i. e. type of gentrification and its characteristics is believed necessary. This will serve as a basis for a conceptual framework to analyze what is happening in Iskandar Malaysia (IM). As globalized urbanization area, IM offers a particularly interesting case as there are already signs of gentrification due to its rapid urbanization. In the residential market, house price in IM shows a rapid and continuous increment. Many foreigners are attracted to the new residential area in IM being promoted as exclusive while promising a quality lifestyle. The locals meanwhile face difficulties in owning a home because of the upward spiraling of house price.   In certain area, the local low income people are displaced by middle and upper income group. The identification of such characteristics and the associated attributes which is {{the second phase of the}} study will determine to <b>what</b> extent <b>IM</b> is in the process of gentrification.

40|$|For decades, the {{internal}} medicine (IM) subinternship {{has served as}} a critical interface between undergraduate and graduate medical education. As such, the vast majority of U. S. medical schools offer this rotation to help students prepare for post-graduate training. Historically an experiential rotation, a formal curriculum with specific learning objectives was eventually developed for this course in 2002. Since then, graduate medical education (GME) has changed significantly with the regulation of duty hours, adoption of competency-based education, and development of training milestones and entrustable professional activities. In response to these and many other changes to residency training and medical practice, in 2010, the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) surveyed its members-with input from the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) Subinternship Task Force-to determine which core skills program directors expected from new medical school graduates. The results of that survey helped to inform a joint CDIM-APDIM committee's decision to re-evaluate the goals of the IM subinternship in an effort to enhance the transition from medical school to residency. This joint committee defined the minimum expectations of <b>what</b> constitutes an <b>IM</b> subinternship rotation, proposed recommended skills for IM subinterns, and discussed challenges and future directions for this crucial course...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the energy {{consumption}} of mobile networks {{has become a major}} concern for mobile operators. Today’s mobile networks’ usage is dominated by over-the-top (OTT) applications and operators are keen to determine the network energy consumed by these OTT applications. With a recent shift in user behavior towards a preference for instant messaging (IM) applications over conventional mobile services, operators are interested in exploring <b>what</b> impact OTT <b>IM</b> applications such as WeChat will have on the energy consumption of a network when compared to a corresponding conventional mobile service. Here, we present for the first time energy assessment models for mobile services based on real network and service measurements to address this need. Using WeChat as an OTT IM application example, our results show that WeChat consumes more network energy than conventional mobile services for both light users and heavy text users due to the network signaling energy overhead. In comparison, for heavy voice users, WeChat consumes less network energy since voice messages are first recorded and then sent in packet bursts. Our findings provide a quantitative analysis of the energy consumption of mobile services, which should be valuable for mobile operators and OTT application developers to improve the energy-efficiency of mobile applications and services.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to compare}} media {{coverage}} of the first-class sporting event, the UEFA EURO 2016, in two Czech and Slovak national sport-oriented newspapers (Sport and Šport). To achieve this goal, the author of the thesis uses qualitative and mainly quantitative content analysis along with interviews with the members of the two respective newsrooms. The author focuses on how much space both dailies give to the event, what part of the whole coverage is made by the news about the Czech or Slovak national teams, and <b>what</b> is the (<b>im)</b> balance between the news and opinion journalism. He also compares the number of journalists that went to do their job in France and the number of their colleagues who were working from the newsrooms in Prague or Bratislava.

He also tries to describe how journalists tend to write about their own national team. Another point of interest is the venality of both newspapers during the UEFA EURO 2016. Based on the interviews with members of both newsrooms, the author compares the media's preparation before the event and their mode of operation over the tournament.

40|$|Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) {{are one of}} the {{principal}} driving forces in the development of an economy because of its significant contribution in terms of number of enterprises, employment, output and exports in most developing as well as developed countries. But SMEs, particularly in developing countries like India, face constraints in key areas such as technology, finance, marketing and human resources. Moreover these SMEs have been exposed to intense competition since early 1990 s because of globalization. However, globalization, the process of continuing integration of the countries in the world has opened up new opportunities for SMEs of developing countries to cater to wider international market which brings out the need for these SMEs to develop competitiveness for their survival as well as growth. It is observed from literature that pursuing appropriate IM practice is one of the ways of acquiring competitiveness among others, by effectively managing and minimizing inventory investment. Inventory management can therefore be one of the crucial determinants of competitiveness as well as operational performance of SMEs in inventory intensive manufacturing industries. The key issue is whether Indian SMEs pursue better IM practices with an intension to reduce their inventory cost and enhance their competitiveness. If so, <b>what</b> are the <b>IM</b> practices pursued by these enterprises? What are the factors which influence the inventory cost and IM performance of enterprises?
