500|$|Four of {{the accused}} men were tried in Westminster on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton, and Norris {{publicly}} maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported the Crown by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London, before a jury of 27 peers. She was accused of adultery, incest, and high treason. By the Treason Act of Edward III, adultery {{on the part of}} a queen was a form of treason (because of the implications for the succession to the throne) for which the penalty was hanging, drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman, but the accusations, and especially that of incestuous adultery, were also designed to impugn her moral character. The other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting the king's death, with her [...] "lovers", so that she might later marry Henry Norris. Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, sat on the jury that unanimously found Anne guilty. When the verdict was announced, he collapsed and had to be carried from the courtroom. He died childless eight months later and was succeeded by his nephew. According to a 1980 legal review by Schauer and Schauer, [...] "there is little if any evidence, apart from Smeaton's possible torture, that the rules of the time were in any <b>way</b> <b>bent</b> in order to assure Anne Boleyn's conviction".|$|E

Growing ever more mystical as he grew older he had gone his lonely <b>way</b> <b>bent</b> and gray and silent, a student of the forest and the stream. So far as I know he never uttered a bitter or despairing word, and when the final great boundary river confronted him he entered it with the same courage with which he ferried the Yukon or crossed the ice fields of Iskoot.|$|E

60|$|So Pierre renounced {{all thought}} of ever having Isabel's dark lantern {{illuminated}} to him. Her light was lidded, and the lid was locked. Nor did he feel a pang at this. By posting hither and thither among the reminiscences of his family, and craftily interrogating his remaining relatives on his father's side, he might possibly rake forth some few small grains of dubious and most unsatisfying things, which, were he that <b>way</b> strongly <b>bent,</b> would only serve the more hopelessly to cripple {{him in his}} practical resolves. He determined to pry not at all into this sacred problem. For him now the mystery of Isabel possessed all the bewitchingness of the mysterious vault of night, whose very darkness evokes the witchery.|$|R

On the instant the eagle wheeled out of the <b>way</b> and <b>bent</b> his head sharply. I had seen him fold wings and drop before, and had held my breath at the speed. But {{dropping}} was of no use now, for the fish fell faster. Instead he swooped downward, adding to {{the weight of his}} fall the push of his strong wings, glancing down like a bolt to catch the fish ere it struck the water, and rising again in a great curve--up and away steadily, evenly as the king should fly, to his own little ones far away on the mountain.|$|R
60|$|From St. Nicholas we {{struck out}} for Visp--or Vispach--on foot. The rain-storms {{had been at}} work during several days, and had done a deal of damage in Switzerland and Savoy. We came to one place where a stream had changed its course and plunged down a {{mountain}} in a new place, sweeping everything before it. Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were ruined. One was washed clear away, and the bed-rock exposed; the other was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks, gravel, mud, and rubbish. The resistless might of water was well exemplified. Some saplings which had stood in the <b>way</b> were <b>bent</b> to the ground, stripped clean of their bark, and buried under rocky debris. The road had been swept away, too.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of natural}} and {{artificial}} textiles is a suitable method for homogeneous soil reinforcing. This method is considered {{on the condition of}} optimum mix and suitable moisture. In this project reinforced kaolinite samples with metal fibers with two different moisture content assessed with axial compressive test. Results shows that metal fibers augmenting with random arrangement cause to increase axial compressive strength of kaolinite clay. Strength augmentation is a function of length, bend angle and amount of fibers weight percentage in mixture. Generally metal fibers amount augmentation cause to increase axial compressive strength of soil This augmentation depend on length to diameter ratio of fiber. In addition to this factor the bend angle type has a considerable effect on kaolinite clay strength level in the <b>way</b> that <b>bent</b> fibers in comparison with straight fibers cause to more strength increase in clay. Also moisture content augmentation cause to decrease axial strength...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the paper}} is to examine whether we can adapt Bent and van Hentenryck’s {{combination}} methods to our problem, and to determine how effective and significant the methods are. In particular, we develop four <b>ways</b> of applying <b>Bent</b> and Van Hentenryck’s consensus approach[3] to our problem. In addition, since we assume the uncertainty distribution is known, we propose a probabilistic sampling method to handle lead-time uncertainty. That is we use this knowledge to select samples, and associate with them weights corresponding to their probability. This method allows us to generate fewer samples but have a more accurate model of future scenarios. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{inherent}} {{disadvantage of}} the hopper {{was that the}} open feeder box allowed dust and grit to enter the gun, which was liable to jam in muddy or dirty conditions due to issues with poor dimensional tolerances, which gave the weapon a bad reputation with Japanese troops. Another issue was that {{the weight of the}} rifle cartridges in the side-mounted hopper unbalanced the weapon when fully loaded. To compensate, the buttstock was designed in a <b>way</b> that it <b>bent</b> to the right, leading to the Chinese nickname for the weapon [...] "bent buttstock" [...] (...)

500|$|The second opera, Daphne, {{begins as}} {{the wedding of}} Florindo and Daphne gets under <b>way.</b> Cupid, <b>bent</b> on more mischief, wounds Daphne with a special arrow, forged by the god Vulcan, that causes her to renounce all love. She {{abandons}} the wedding and announces that she will join the goddess Diana and become a huntress. This sparks a series of schemes and counter-schemes as both Apollo and Florindo continue to pursue Daphne while the other would-be lovers manoeuvre for position. Lycoris assures Apollo that Daphne's abandonment of the wedding was a signal that she favours him. Lycoris also steals Daphne's cloak and, wearing it as a disguise, makes advances to Damon, having first ensured that Florindo overhears. Florindo is enraged by what he believes is Daphne's duplicity, and denounces her. Damon confirms the story. Daphne, bewildered, pleads with her father Peneus to prove her innocence; he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree. Cupid blames Apollo's pride for the fiasco, but gives him the laurel as his [...] "special tree". Florindo now accepts Alfirena, and Lycoris, having confessed her scheming, is united with Damon. Only the guiltless Daphne ends up losing everything.|$|R
60|$|Of Ralph's {{decision}} {{there could}} be no question, and the Cobhurst family was instantly in a flurry. Mrs. Drane, Cicely, and Miriam gave all their thoughts and every available moment of time to the work necessary on the simple outfit that was all that Miriam needed or desired; and in two days she was ready for the journey. Ralph was glad to do anything he could to help in the good work, but, as this was little, he was obliged to content himself with encomiums upon the noble character of Dora Bannister. That she should even think of offering such an inexpressible delight and benefit to his sister was sufficient proof of Miss Bannister's solid worth and tender, gracious nature. These remarks made to the ladies in general really did help in the good work, for, while Ralph was talking in this <b>way,</b> Cicely <b>bent</b> more earnestly over her sewing and stitched faster. Until now, she had never thought much about Miss Bannister; but, without intending it, or in the least desiring it, she began to think a good deal about her, even when Ralph was not there.|$|R
60|$|Understanding my host's manner I {{guessed that}} if I hinted at {{acquiescence}} this would {{lead up to}} a definite offer, and it appeared that both, in their own <b>way,</b> were <b>bent</b> on persuading me. The temptation was alluring, when disaster appeared imminent, and I afterwards wondered how it was I did not yield. Wounded pride or sheer obstinacy may, however, have restrained me, {{for one of the}} most bitter things is to own one's self beaten; but even then I felt that my place was on the prairie. On the one hand there was only the prospect of grinding care and often brutal labor, which wore the body to exhaustion and blunted the mental faculties; on the other, at least some rest and leisure, contact with culture and refinement, and perhaps even yet a vague possibility of drawing nearer to the woman beside me. At that moment, however, Lucille Haldane halted in front of us, and the trifling incident helped to turn the scale. Young as she was, her views were mine, and for some unfathomable reason I shook off what seemed a weak tendency to yield when I met her gaze.|$|R

Then they walked along the tramway towards an iron shed, where there was a delay while one of the men lighted a lantern and opened the door When this was done they went in, and for almost an hour the peons rolled out barrels and dragged about boxes and cases of which they opened one here and there. Still, {{there was no sign of}} a rifle, and when they had passed through two or three other sheds Morales’ face was expressionless as he professed himself satisfied. They walked back silently side by side, until the officer stopped by a cane truck and rubbed off the ash from his cigar on one of the cases that lay upon it. He also moved a little so that he could see Appleby’s face in the light of the lantern a dusky workman held. The latter was eyeing Morales curiously, and Appleby fancied by the <b>way</b> he <b>bent</b> his right hand that very little would bring the wicked, keen‐pointed knife {{flashing}} from his sleeve.|$|R
