40|$|Equine herpesvirus- 1 (EHV- 1) {{infection}} is of significant animal welfare and economic importance. Yet, no standardised molecular techniques {{are available for}} diagnosis or confirmation of viral infection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a standardised and quantitative assay system for the reliable detection of EHV- 1 infection which was capable of eliminating the likelihood of false negative results. A region within the EHV- 1 glycoprotein B gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to generate a control plasmid, amplifiable by identical primers to wild type EHV- 1, yet capable of detection by an alternate dinitrophenylated oligonucleotide probe in a PCR/ELISA system. A competitive PCR/ELISA system which can control for the presence of PCR inhibitors and which is capable of detecting 63 genome equivalents of EHV- 1 has been developed.

40|$|A rapid enzyme {{immunoassay}} (EIA) {{was developed for}} the phenotypic detection of diphtheria toxin among clinical isolates of corynebacteria. The assay uses equine polyclonal antitoxin as the capture antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled monoclonal antibody, specific for fragment A of the toxin molecule, as the detecting antibody. The assay is rapid, sensitive, and specific: a final result is available within 3 h of colony selection, {{and the limits of}} detection are 0. 1 ng of pure diphtheria toxin/ml. Toxigenicity could be detected with isolates grown on a diverse range of culture media, including selective agars. Toxin detection using the EIA was compared to that with the Elek test and PCR detection of fragment A of the diphtheria toxin (tox) gene, using 245 isolates of corynebacteria. The results for the EIA were in complete concordance with those of the Elek test: 87 toxigenic and 158 nontoxigenic isolates. Ten of the phenotypically nontoxigenic strains were found to contain fragment A of the tox gene but did not express the toxin protein. These isolates were found to be nontoxigenic in the Vero cell tissue culture cytotoxicity assay and were therefore nontoxigenic for diagnostic purposes.

The average time between a referral being received and clinical advice being provided to the referring GPs was 46 hours. The number of referrals in the present study, 1. 05 per month per site, was similar to that reported in other primary care studies.

In Nottingham 50 % of these patients are discharged from the A&E department without admission to hospital and are advised to inform and see their general practitioner (GP), but many fail to do so. We instituted a system of identifying all patients seen and discharged from our A&E department with asthma and informing their GPs and practice nurses <b>within</b> <b>one</b> <b>working</b> <b>day</b> of the event by fax. To determine whether any action had been taken following receipt of our fax, we contacted each general practice 1 month after the A&E attendance in 100 consecutive cases.

We analysed factors associated with reporting time and evaluated the IfSG amendment. Local reporting time is the time between date of notification and date of export to the state public health agency and state reporting time is time between date of arrival at the state public health agency and the date of export. We selected cases reported between 28 March 2012 and 28 March 2014. We calculated the median local and state reporting time, stratified by potentially influential factors, computed a negative binominal regression model and assessed quality and workload parameters. Before the IfSG amendment the median local reporting time was 4 days and 1 day afterwards. The state reporting time was 0 days before and after. Influential factors are the individual local public health agency, the notified disease, the notification software and the day of the week. Data quality and workload parameters did not change. The IfSG amendment has decreased local reporting time, no relevant loss of data quality or identifiable workload-increase could be detected. State reporting time is negligible.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the suitability of}} a multiplex PCR-based assay for sensitive and rapid detection of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in soil and water. Methods and Results: Soil and water samples were spiked with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and subjected to two stages of enrichment prior to multiplex PCR. Detection sensitivities were as high as 1 cfu ml– 1 drinking water and 2 cfu g– 1 soil. Starvation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 for 35 d prior to addition to soil {{did not affect the}} ability of the assay to detect initial cell numbers as low as 10 cfu g– 1 soil. Use of an 8 -h primary enrichment enabled detection of as few as 6 cfu g– 1 soil, and 104 cfu g– 1 soil with a 6 -h primary enrichment. When soil was inoculated with 105 cfu g– 1, the PCR assay indicated persistence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 during a 35 d incubation. However, when soil was inoculated with lower numbers of pathogen, PCR amplification signals indicated survival to be dependent on cell concentration. Conclusions: A multiplex PCR-based assay, in combination with an enrichment strategy enabled sensitive and rapid detection of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in soil and water.

Within each microcolony, hybridized, peroxidase-labeled PNA probe and chemiluminescent substrate generated light which was subsequently captured on film. Thus, each spot of light represented one microcolony of E. coli. Following probe selection based on 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence alignments and sample matrix interference, the sensitivity and specificity of the probe Eco 16 S 07 C were determined by dot hybridization to RNA of eight bacterial species. Only the rRNA of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected by Eco 16 S 07 C with the latter mismatch hybridization being eliminated by a PNA blocker probe targeting P. aeruginosa 16 S rRNA. The sensitivity and specificity {{for the detection of}} E. coli by PNA CISH were then determined using 8 E. coli strains and 17 other bacterial species, including closely related species. No bacterial strains other than E. coli and Shigella spp. were detected, which is in accordance with 16 S rDNA sequence information. Furthermore, the enumeration of microcolonies of E. coli represented by spots of light correlated 92 to 95 % with visible colonies following overnight incubation.

40|$|A {{standard}} operating procedure (SOP) for determination of the sulfur mustard adduct to the N-terminal valine in hemoglobin was developed. By using this SOP, {{it was found that}} the Nterminal valine adduct in globin of hairless guinea pigs and marmosets which had been exposed to sulfur mustard (0. 5 LD 50) is persistent for at least 56 and 94 days, respectively. The SOP could be properly set up and carried out at another institute (MRICD) <b>within</b> <b>one</b> <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> Upon pronase digestion of albumin from human blood exposed to sulfur mustard, the major adduct fragment was identified by LC-tandem MS analysis as the tripeptide (S- 2 -hydroxyethylthioethyl) Cys-Pro-Phe, arising from alkylation at cysteine- 34. An LC-tandem MS method was developed for analysis of this peptide, which enabled us to detect exposure to ≥ 10 nM of sulfur mustard, using only 3 mg of albumin. The method was successfully applied to analysis of blood samples of Iranian casualties from the Iran-Iraq conflict. Presently, this is by far the most sensitive marker for exposure of human blood to sulfur mustard. Upon incubation with alkali (pH 13) of keratin isolated from callus which had been exposed to [14 C]sulfur mustard, 80 % of the bound radioactivity was split off as [14 C]thiodiglycol. This procedure could be used for GC-MS analysis of thiodiglycol (after derivatization with pentafluorobenzoyl chloride) that was released by alkaline treatment from keratin, isolated from human skin which had been exposed to saturated sulfur mustard vapor for ≥ 2 min.
