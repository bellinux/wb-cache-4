5000|$|Special {{feedthrough}} twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> {{differ from}} standard <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> {{in that they}} have an additional opening {{at the top of the}} insulated cap. This allows a single-conductor bare wire to be pushed through the hole, forming a [...] "pigtail" [...] section which can be attached to a grounding screw. These feedthrough connectors are typically green, and are also called [...] "screw-on grounding connectors".|$|R

50|$|A common {{application}} of the lineman's pliers in gripping and twisting wires together, preparatory to installing a twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connector.</b> Pliers may also be used in pulling a fish-tape, to crimp metals, and to pull nails and other fasteners.|$|R
50|$|Automotive {{component}} manufacturer Delphi Corporation operated {{a plant in}} Clinton from the early 1970s until its closure in 2009, making cable and <b>wiring</b> <b>connectors.</b> When Delphi closed the plant in late 2009, {{with the loss of}} 280 jobs, production moved to Delphi's Warren, Ohio facility.|$|R
5000|$|In North American {{building}} <b>wiring,</b> twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are frequently}} used in low-voltage power circuits for wires {{up to about}} #10 AWG in size. These allow wire connections in electrical boxes that are more quickly installed than the obsolete practice of soldering and taping wires.|$|R
50|$|Twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{commonly}} color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity. They {{are commonly}} used {{as an alternative to}} terminal blocks or the soldering of conductors together, since they are quicker to install and, unlike soldered connections, allow easy subsequent removal for future modifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{process was}} {{time-consuming}} and potentially dangerous. Marr was injured when he spilled molten solder on himself. Seeking a safer, more efficient connection method, Marr, {{working in his}} home workshop, developed the first pressure-type <b>wire</b> <b>connector.</b> In 1914, he produced a set-screw version, the forerunner of the present-day twist-on connector used throughout North America.|$|R
50|$|The DDECIII ECM was {{thinner than}} the DDECII ECM, and had <b>wiring</b> <b>{{connectors}}</b> at both ends. The front end had two five pin connectors for the injectors, and a thirty pin connector for the engine sensors. The rear end had a five pin Power Connector, six pin Communications Connector, and a thirty pin Vehicle Interface Harness Connector.|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} used to prevent rust, but is also {{commonly}} applied {{to the ends of}} stranded wire used as electrical conductors to prevent oxidation (which increases electrical resistance), and to keep them from fraying or unraveling when used in various <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> like twist-ons, binding posts, or terminal blocks, where stray strands can cause a short circuit.|$|R
5000|$|A router to router {{crossover}} cable uses two 8 position connectors and a UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable with differently <b>wired</b> <b>connectors</b> at each end. Although a registered jack specifies the wiring pattern and corresponding form factor {{rather than just}} the pin assignments or the physical connector, {{crossover cable}}s are often incorrectly marketed as [...] "RJ45 crossover cables".|$|R
50|$|Easter {{lights are}} often {{produced}} in pastels. These typically have white <b>wire</b> and <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{typically}} installed by hand. They may have external grooves {{to make them}} easier to handle and apply. Winglike extensions are commonly molded into higher quality connectors to reduce operator muscle fatigue when installing {{a large number of}} the connectors. Such extensions also allow these connectors to be installed with a common nut driver or a specialized tool.|$|R
5000|$|Twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> are not {{generally}} recommended {{for use with}} aluminum wire. [...] The US Consumer Product Safety Commission does not approve of their use with aluminum wire, and approves of only two (alternative) methods of connection. [...] In spite of this, several companies manufacture twist-on connectors which they claim are designed specifically for, and rated for, use with aluminum conductors.|$|R

Details are given at each stage of testing including calibration, fixturing and sample preparation...|$|R
50|$|The Multiface ST and Multiface ST II were {{released}} for Atari's ST computers. It {{connected to the}} cartridge port with a <b>wired</b> <b>connector</b> attaching to the monitor port (to generate the interrupt signal when the button was pressed). Far less effective than the earlier Spectrum models, it required the cartridge {{to be present in}} order to load saved games. Red, green & blue cartridges have been noted.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution {{has the potential}} to reduce costs throughout an aircraft's life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with <b>wire</b> and <b>connectors</b> will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting <b>wires</b> and <b>connectors</b> will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing wiring installations, late changes in an aircraft's design would be easier to manage, etc.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, Dell {{switched}} from using primarily ATX motherboards and PSU to using boards and power supplies with mechanically identical but differently <b>wired</b> <b>connectors.</b> This meant customers wishing {{to upgrade their}} hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. While motherboard power connections reverted to the industry standard in 2003, Dell continues to remain secretive about their motherboard pin-outs for peripherals (such as MMC readers and power on/off switches and LEDs).|$|R
50|$|This {{common and}} simple splice {{is not very}} strong mechanically. It can be made {{stronger}} by coating it with solder, {{or it can be}} twisted and then held in place by the internal metal spring or threads of a twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connector,</b> also called a wire nut. Because it is not very strong, the splice is not meant to connect wires that will be pulled or stressed. Rather, it is intended for wires that are protected inside an enclosure or junction box.|$|R
5000|$|In some applications, the PC {{speaker is}} affixed {{directly}} to the computer's motherboard; in others, including the first IBM Personal Computer, the speaker is attached by <b>wire</b> to a <b>connector</b> on the motherboard. Some PC cases come with a PC speaker preinstalled. A <b>wired</b> PC speaker <b>connector</b> may have a two-, three-, or four-pin configuration, and either two or three <b>wires.</b> The female <b>connector</b> of the speaker connects to pin headers on the motherboard, which are sometimes labeled [...] or [...]|$|R
5000|$|Twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and shapes. While their exterior covering is typically made from insulating plastic, their means of connection is a tapered coiled metal insert, which threads onto the wires and holds them securely. When such a connector is twisted onto the stripped and twisted-together ends of wires, the wires are drawn into the connector's metal insert and squeezed together inside it. Electrical continuity is maintained by both the direct twisted wire-to-wire contact and by contact with the metal insert.|$|R
50|$|Another {{specialized}} connector {{version has}} a permanently attached wire pigtail {{protruding from the}} top of the insulated cap. The pigtail may be unterminated, or it may end in a preinstalled spade lug. If colored white, it typically may be used for splicing neutral wires in a device box, while leaving a pigtail free for connection to a device (such as a receptacle). If colored green, the assembly is intended to be used as a grounding pigtail, similar to the feedthrough twist-on <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> described in the previous paragraph.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his early}} days of selling {{high-end}} audio equipment, William E. Low discovered that {{the sound of an}} audio system was easily influenced by the quality of the cables connecting its various components. Hi-fi journalist, Richard Hardesty explained: [...] "With experimentation Bill found that better interconnect and speaker cables could make bigger audible improvements than many costly upgrades to amplifiers and speakers. And he recognized the opportunities afforded by this new category of audio components. He founded AudioQuest to explore and develop new and innovative <b>wire,</b> <b>connectors</b> and accessories." ...|$|R

5000|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of 8P8C modular jacks arrange for the pins of the 8P8C modular connector jack {{to be linked}} to <b>wire</b> <b>connectors</b> (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the [...] "bottom right hand" [...] IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular connector pin 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular connector pin 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.|$|R
