60|$|I dragged {{that poor}} sick man {{from his bed}} and brought him. He looked at the child {{and said she was}} not dying. This was joy unspeakable to me, but it made my wife as mad as if he had offered her a {{personal}} affront. Then he said the child's cough was only caused by some trifling irritation or other in the throat. At this I thought my wife had a mind to show him the door. Now the doctor said he would make the child cough harder and dislodge the trouble. So he gave her something that sent her into a spasm of coughing, and presently up came a little <b>wood</b> <b>splinter</b> or so.|$|E
5000|$|A foreign-body {{granuloma}} {{occurs when}} a foreign body (such as a <b>wood</b> <b>splinter,</b> piece of metal, glass etc.) penetrates the body's soft tissue followed by acute inflammation and formation of a granuloma. [...] In some cases the foreign body can be found and removed even years after the precipitating event.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{retirement}} Kay was helping his former assistant {{to chop up}} some old railway sleepers, for use as fuel in the clubhouse, {{when he got a}} <b>wood</b> <b>splinter</b> in his right thumb. He developed blood poisoning, his condition gradually worsened, and on 18 April 1927 Kay died. His funeral was attended by fellow professionals, Seaton Carew members, and staff from the Club acted as pall bearers. The body of this golfing legend was finally laid to rest in Seaton Carew parish churchyard and he is commemorated {{in the name of the}} Club's old course 8th hole which is named [...] "Jimmy Kay".|$|E

5000|$|Wood: {{this type}} of {{splinter}} is contracted from lumber or other vegetative materials. <b>Wood</b> <b>splinters</b> must be removed from wounds because they are associated with inflammation and risk of infection.

50|$|One case of tetanus {{contraction}} {{through a}} splinter {{was seen in}} Ohio, 1993. An 80-year-old woman was presented to an ED with dysphagia and a stiff jaw. Not long after a preliminary checkup, a <b>wood</b> <b>splinter</b> {{was found to have}} been lodged in her chin for approximately 1 week; the area was erythematous with active purulent drainage. The woman was diagnosed with tetanus, admitted to the hospital, and begun on a regimen of 3,000 units of tetanus immune globulin, tetanus toxoid, and intravenous clindamycin. Despite aggressive treatment, including assisted mechanical ventilation, the patient succumbed to the effects of her primary infection and died 15 days later. The woman had no history of previous tetanus vaccinations despite previous care for a wound and on-going medical attention for hypertension.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Robert sacrifices {{himself to}} allow the Doctor, Rose, and the Queen to prepare the {{telescope}} in the Observatory. They are able to trap the werewolf in the concentrated light of the full moon collected by the diamond. The transformed human being begs for the Doctor to kill him by increasing {{the power of the}} light concentration, which he obliges. As they recover, the Queen finds a small cut she insists came from a <b>wood</b> <b>splinter,</b> but the Doctor remarks to Rose that all her children will carry a form of haemophilia (see Haemophilia in European royalty), and that perhaps this was simply a Victorian euphemism for lycanthropy. The next day, the Queen dubs the Doctor and Rose with royal titles before banishing them from the British Empire, apparently [...] "horrified" [...] by their connection to and comfort in a world she does not understand (as she is aware that the Doctor is an alien). In honour of Sir Robert's sacrifice and his father's ingenuity, she orders the creation of the Torchwood Institute to help defend Britain from further alien attacks declaring that if the Doctor returns, Torchwood will be ready to deal with him.|$|E
30|$|One {{pediatric}} {{case report}} described how easily POCUS {{can be incorporated}} into the clinical evaluation of wounds that have a high probability of tissue foreign body. In this report, a <b>wood</b> <b>splinter</b> was clearly visualized under ultrasound and ultrasound further assisted in guiding foreign body removal [313].|$|E

50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 31 July 1985, during shooting {{in a suburb}} of Wilmington, North Carolina for Maximum Overdrive. A radio controlled lawnmower used in a scene went out of control and struck a block of wood used as a camera support, shooting out <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> which injured Nannuzzi, the director of photography on the production. As a result, Nannuzzi lost his right eye.|$|R
30|$|It is {{reported}} {{that less than}} 1 % of ingested foreign bodies perforate the GI tract and they are usually sharp or more than 6.5 [*]cm [9]. Perforation of the Meckel’s diverticulum is rare and reported only in 1.6 % of the total GI tract perforations secondary to foreign bodies [10]. In 2009, Chan et al. reported 300 cases of perforation of Meckel’s diverticulum by foreign object [6], and among them, cases of <b>wood</b> <b>splinter</b> [11], button battery [12] and chicken and fish bone [6] have been mentioned in literature. It is said that tendency of these objects to lodge in the blind pouch of the Meckel’s diverticulum causes the perforation [13].|$|E
60|$|There {{was a pair}} of dumb-bells on the floor, {{belonging}} to Mike. He never used them, but they always managed to get themselves packed {{with the rest of his}} belongings on the last day of the holidays. Mr. Downing seized one of these, and delivered two rapid blows at the cupboard-door. The <b>wood</b> <b>splintered.</b> A third blow smashed the flimsy lock. The cupboard, with any skeletons it might contain, was open for all to view.|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s he {{suffered}} from stomach pains, in 1936 a non cancerous polyp was removed from his throat and he developed eczema on his legs. He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of}} the July 20 plot bomb blast in 1944 and 200 <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> had to be removed from his legs, but he was otherwise uninjured. Some doctors dismiss Hitler's ailments as hypochondria, pointing out the apparently drastic decline of Hitler's health as Germany began losing World War II.|$|R
50|$|A second incident, {{this time}} leading to serious injury, {{occurred}} on July 31, 1985 while filming {{in a suburb}} of Wilmington, North Carolina. A radio-controlled lawnmower used in a scene went out of control and struck a block of wood used as a camera support, shooting out <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> which injured the director of photography Armando Nannuzzi. As a result of this incident, Nannuzzi lost an eye. Nannuzzi sued Stephen King, and 17 others, on February 18, 1987 for $18 million in damages due to unsafe working practices. The suit was settled out of court.|$|R
500|$|On December 12, the Doors {{played the}} Warehouse in New Orleans for {{what turned out}} to be their last live {{performance}} with Morrison. Midway through the set, a drunk Morrison began slurring the lyrics to [...] "Light My Fire", interrupted with speeches and jokes. He sat in front of the drum platform in between Krieger and Manzarek's solos, but did not stand up to finish the song. After prompting by Densmore, he tried to sing, before bashing the mic stand into the stage until its <b>wood</b> <b>splintered.</b> The Doors agreed to stop touring and focus on completing L.A.

50|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine. He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of}} the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|R

Staff and students hiding in the library exterior rooms later said they also heard the gunmen say: [...] "All jocks stand up! We'll get the guys in white hats!" [...] (Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members, typically jocks.) When no one stood up in response, Harris said, [...] "Fine, I'll start shooting anyway!" [...] He fired his shotgun twice at a desk, not knowing that a student named Evan Todd was hiding beneath it. Todd was hit by <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> but was not seriously injured.|$|R
5000|$|The MK3 {{offensive}} {{hand grenade}} is a cylindrical concussion grenade designed to produce casualties during close combat while minimizing danger to friendly personnel exposed {{in the open}} owing to minimal fragmentation. There is a secondary fragmentation hazard though from rocks, gravel, <b>wood</b> <b>splinters,</b> glass, etc. The grenade is also used for concussion effects in enclosed areas, for blasting, or for demolition tasks. The shock waves (overpressure) produced by this grenade when used in enclosed areas are greater than those produced by the fragmentation grenade. It is, therefore, very effective against enemy soldiers located in bunkers, buildings, and fortified areas. It {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "concussion" [...] or [...] "demo" [...] (from demolition) grenade.|$|R
2500|$|At 5.50pm, when Junon was [...] "within Half Pistol Shott" [...] of {{the lead}} frigate, that vessel {{suddenly}} hauled down its Spanish and British flags and raised the French ensign. The following three vessels followed suit, and all four vessels opened fire on Junon at short range. Junons crew were taken by surprise; a ragged retaliatory broadside struck two of the French ships but caused little damage. Junon herself received broadsides to her port, starboard, and stern and quickly became indefensible; her crew surrendered at 7pm when French soldiers boarded their ship. A total of 15 British sailors were killed and 44 wounded, including Shortland, who was hit by musket fire and then struck through the body by <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> torn from the deck by cannon fire.|$|R
5000|$|Horses often gnaw on wood rails, fences or boards as if {{they were}} food. This has been linked with dietary deficiencies, and often can be {{remedied}} with a balanced diet or dietary supplementation [...] Lignophagia in horses can be a cause of colic due to the ingestion of <b>wood</b> <b>splinters.</b> and in severe cases, can cause excessive wearing and deterioration of the teeth. A related vice is cribbing, wherein the horse grabs a wood board and sucks in air; not all wood-chewing is cribbing and though cribbing may also result in chewing on the wood surface, the two vices are not identical. Horses displaying abnormal oral behaviours may be less desirable to potential buyers and may be devalued as a consequence.|$|R
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> had to be removed from his legs.

5000|$|Even {{when the}} cars did not crash, racing {{on a board}} track was {{exceedingly}} dangerous due to flying <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> and debris, and due to the primitive tire technology of the era. [...] In one oral history taken from a driver, he told a tale of wooden shards driven into the faces of drivers and riding mechanics, and sudden catastrophic tire failures caused by track conditions. [...] Cars were fitted with anti-splinter devices to protect their radiators. Other protective devices hadn't been invented yet (seat belts, roll bars, or fire protection). Drivers often were ejected from their cars and would fall tens of feet (several meters). Drivers and riding mechanics often were driven over by their own or another car. Pete DePaolo wrote in his book Wall Smacker that racing on boards was [...] "a great sensation, tearing around a board speedway dodging holes and flying timber." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stauffenberg {{was seen}} leaving the conference {{building}} by Kurt Salterberg, a soldier on guard duty {{who did not}} consider {{this out of the}} ordinary as attendees sometimes left to collect documents. He then saw a [...] "massive" [...] cloud of smoke, <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> and paper and men being hurled through a window and door. Stauffenberg, upon hearing the explosion and seeing the smoke, believed that Hitler was dead. He then climbed into a staff car with his aide Werner von Haeften and managed to bluff his way past three checkpoints to exit the Wolfsschanze complex. Werner von Haeften then tossed the second unprimed bomb into the forest as they made a dash for Rastenburg airfield, reaching it before it could be realised that Stauffenberg could be responsible for the explosion. By 13:00 he was airborne in a Heinkel He 111 arranged by General Eduard Wagner.|$|R
50|$|With {{the success}} of the Euro-pallets, a number of replicas entered the market that used low-quality <b>wood</b> which <b>splintered</b> easily and were prone to mould. So the European railways, which own the {{trademarks}} for EUR/EPAL, created a separate standardization body. The European Pallet Association was founded in 1991, and the EUR and EPAL logo may only be used by licensees of that organization.|$|R

5000|$|The lawmen {{assembled}} a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were bootleggers {{living in the}} garage apartment. Though taken by surprise, Clyde was noted for remaining cool under fire. He, Jones, and Buck quickly killed Detective McGinnis and fatally wounded Constable Harryman. During the escape from the apartment, Parker laid down covering fire with her BAR, forcing Highway Patrol Sergeant G. B. Kahler to duck behind a large oak tree while [...]30 caliber bullets struck the other side, forcing <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> into the sergeant's face. Parker {{got into the car}} with the others. They slowed enough to pull in Blanche Barrow from the street, where she was pursuing her dog Snow Ball.

25|$|The next morning, the German vanguard found a {{weak point}} {{between the two}} armies and many German troops were able to cross the Autobahn before the Soviet forces plugged the gap. The {{fighting}} was heavy and included continuous air attacks by the 2nd Air Army, as well as tree-bursting shells which rained <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> through the area. During the battle, the Soviet air force flew 2,459 attack missions and 1,683 bombing sorties. The German forces found {{that they could not}} use their armour as well as they had hoped, because it was vulnerable to destruction on the roads and could not get a good grip on the sandy soil of the pine forests in the region. The German vanguard managed to reach and cross Reichsstrasse 96, south of Zossen and north of Baruth, where it was spotted by a Luftwaffe plane. Hitler was furious when he realised that Busse was attempting to break out west and not to come to his aid in Berlin. His command sent several messages demanding that the army turn towards Berlin, but received no answer.|$|R
25|$|The Battle for Longueval and Delville Wood, {{had started}} with a charge by the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division between Longueval and High Wood and {{two weeks after the}} wood was cleared, tanks went into action for the first time. A number of {{important}} tactical lessons were learned from the battle for the village and wood. Night assembly and advances, dawn attacks after short, concentrated artillery barrages for tactical surprise, defensive lines built on the fringes wooded areas, because tree roots in woods prevented digging and to avoid shells which detonated in branches, showering troops with <b>wood</b> <b>splinters.</b> Troops were relieved after two days, as longer periods exhausted them and consumed their ammunition, bombs and rations. The persistence of the British attacks during July and August, helped to preserve Franco-British relations, although Joffre criticised the large number of small attacks on 11 August and tried to cajole Haig into agreeing to a big combined attack. A bigger attack British by three corps on 18 August, was spoilt by several days of heavy rain, which reduced artillery observation and gained no ground at Delville Wood.|$|R

At about 10:30, Cranley reported that the position on Point 213 was becoming untenable and withdrawal was impossible. A breakout attempt was planned and [...] two hours later, a Cromwell crew tried {{to get back to}} Villers-Bocage by a roundabout route and were knocked out by German tank fire. The Germans shelled the trees along the road, spraying shell and <b>wood</b> <b>splinters</b> and after five minutes the troops on the ridge surrendered. The British tried to burn their tanks but German soldiers arrived quickly and took thirty of the CLY prisoner, along with some riflemen and troops of the Royal Horse Artillery.
