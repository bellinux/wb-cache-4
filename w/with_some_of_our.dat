The next section deals <b>with</b> <b>some</b> preliminary results about the positivity and boundedness of solutions, the basic reproduction number, and the existence of equilibria. In Section  3, we establish the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the chronic infection equilibrium. The global stability of both equilibria is investigated in Section  4. The paper ends <b>with</b> <b>some</b> applications <b>of</b> <b>our</b> results in Section  5.|$|R

40|$|National audienceWe are {{interested}} in designing a Project-Based Learning Management System (PBLMS) for high school students. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} study of ergonomics of existing PBLMSs. We first analyze four different PBLMSs regarding three points: aims, functionalities and indicators. We particularly focus on the indicators and analyze their attributes: purpose(s), concept(s), data construction and visualization. Based on this analysis we discuss the utility, the usability and the acceptability of the studied systems according to their functionalities, the types of visualization and the users.

Conceptually, the cartesian boundary method is quite simple. Solid bodies blank out areas of a background, cartesian mesh, and the resultant cut cells are singled out for special attention. However, there are several obstacles that must be overcome {{in order to achieve}} a practical scheme. We present a general strategy that overcomes these obstacles, together <b>with</b> <b>some</b> details <b>of</b> <b>our</b> successful conversion <b>of</b> an adaptive mesh algorithm from a body-fitted code to a cartesian boundary code...|$|R

40|$|Applying {{principles}} of merger evaluation {{to the health}} care industry in general, and to hospital markets in particular, poses several unique challenges. Definition of relevant geographic markets and assessment of the consequences of changes in competition for patient and social welfare are complicated by asymmetric information and moral hazard due to health insurance. We suggest a new empirical approach to assessing the impact of hospital competition which addresses the shortcomings of existing methods. We then summarize our main results on the welfare consequences of competition. We conclude with an illustration <b>of</b> how <b>our</b> methods can be used to assess the welfare implications of specific hospital mergers, and <b>with</b> <b>some</b> implications <b>of</b> <b>our</b> findings for antitrust policy. ...|$|R

30|$|However, recent {{research}} {{at the intersection of}} psychology and economics—behavioral economics—is changing <b>our</b> understating <b>of</b> how individuals choose and act, and <b>with</b> it, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> conclusions for policy design (Rabin [1998]; Thaler and Sunstein [2008]; Congdon, Kling, and Mullainathan [2011]). Behavioral economics stresses empirical findings of behavior that are partially at odds with standard economic assumptions. The key empirical findings from field research in behavioral economics imply that individuals can make systematic errors or be put off by complexity, that they procrastinate, and that they hold non-standard preferences and non-standard beliefs (Della Vigna [2009]). To the extent that these behavioral tendencies operate in labor market contexts, they may change both <b>our</b> understanding <b>of</b> the challenges that policy design must meet, as well as the opportunities and design tools available to policymakers.|$|R
