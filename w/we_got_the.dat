25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

[...] O'Sullivan reported that the CIA {{declined to comment on the}} officers in question.

500|$|The {{series was}} {{successfully}} nominated in 2009, {{but failed to}} merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation.

500|$|Nude {{dancing at}} the club began in 1985 after a judge {{overturned}} City of Portland ordinances banning it at venues which served alcohol. A lawsuit over pasties and G-strings was brought after Portland annexed land formerly regulated by Multnomah County, which allowed tavern dancers to perform without clothing. A bar forced by the annexation to eliminate its nude dancing successfully sued the city. [...] "As soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> word , we went nude," [...] said a club employee who was quoted in The Oregonian.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which {{released}} Roman Candle), {{said about}} this time in Smith's life, [...] "I talked him out of thinking {{that he wanted to}} kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him." [...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> brunt of Elliott's initial depression... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|E

500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Selway, Radiohead's American label Capitol saw {{the album}} as [...] "more or less, 'commercial suicide'. They weren't really into it. At that point, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> fear. How {{is this going}} to be received?" [...] According to Yorke, [...] "When we first gave [...] to Capitol, they were taken aback. I don't really know why it's so {{important}} now, but I'm excited about it." [...] Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million units to a half a million. In O'Brien's view only Parlophone, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of potential marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's early hit [...] "Creep".|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{would have}} the film – American Gangster – playing on the {{monitors}} above the recording booth {{as a source of}} motivation during the recording sessions. In an interview with MTV, producer LV from The Hitmen said [...] "Jay {{would have the}} beats...He'd do the record, and he'd send it back to us. We'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records. From having live horns, live strings, live drummers. This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles of shit. We went all out. We brought in musicians to bring it out. Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums. Once <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> vocals back, we brought in all the extra candy".|$|E

500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} among four other episodes {{submitted}} by the Family Guy production team for consideration of an Emmy Award nomination, in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series category. [...] "And I'm Joyce Kinney" [...] was submitted, along with [...] "Halloween on Spooner Street", [...] "Road to the North Pole", [...] "New Kidney in Town" [...] and [...] "Trading Places". The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, [...] "We had internal discussions in the writers' room, {{and it seemed like}} we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Observer, co-creator Mark Gatiss says that they experienced more difficulty finding the right actor to play Dr John Watson than they had for the title character. Producer Sue Vertue said, [...] "Benedict {{was the only person}} we actually saw for [...] Sherlock... Once Benedict was there it was really just making sure <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chemistry for John —and I think you get it as soon as they come into the room, you can see that they work together". Several actors auditioned for the part of Watson, and Martin Freeman eventually took the role. Steven Moffat said that Matt Smith was the first to audition unsuccessfully. He was rejected for being too [...] "barmy", as the producers required someone [...] "straighter" [...] for Watson. Shortly after, Moffat cast Smith as the Eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who.|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was very}} close to what Mottola wanted the {{finished}} product to be, according to Afanasieff.

She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: {{a day and a half}} for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing." ...|$|E
