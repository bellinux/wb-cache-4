5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly inspire {{the creation of a}} deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be {{lively and}} highly strung, {{especially}} the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas {{were used as}} harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being gelded to mitigate their volatile nature. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra.

5|$|The long-standing {{traditional}} view, once widely accepted, is {{that the}} Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the Lebor Gabála Érenn, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along {{with the presence of}} Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have given their name to the island.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{correction}} of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with {{a reduction of}} $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies <b>were</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.|$|E
