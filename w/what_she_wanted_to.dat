25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's summer cottage in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E

500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say, where she wanted to be, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1805, the King {{began making}} plans for Charlotte's education, and engaged a large staff of {{instructors}} for his only legitimate grandchild, with the Bishop of Exeter to instruct {{her in the}} faith that King George believed one day Charlotte, as queen, would defend. [...] The King hoped that these teachers would [...] "render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside". [...] According to Holme, this instruction made little impression on Charlotte, who chose to learn only <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> learn.

In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt [...] "scared and vulnerable" [...] while filming Jersey Girl, adding [...] "I was so used to those {{other elements of the}} character [...] On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue."

500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write about. After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS! They live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don’t count), and they are much bigger animals, with {{a whole lot more}} potential for fighting".|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were rewritten {{to convey}} Jackson's {{feelings}} about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. It {{was the last}} song to be recorded for Control, and was ultimately chosen as the lead single for the album, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life: [...] "I {{think it was very}} representative of the sparseness and the funkiness {{that the rest of the}} album had and the attitude Janet had about being in control, being mature to the point where she had definite opinions about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say". The song was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense." ...|$|E
500|$|Laura A. Bischoff of the Dayton Daily News {{commented that}} the book was the [...] "ultimate insider's guide to The Simpsons." [...] However, several critics {{commented that the}} book was {{straightforward}} and presented few interesting stories. Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook." [...] Rosellen Brewer of the Library Journal commented that [...] "Cartwright's own life notwithstanding, there is nothing really new or exciting here. She knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do {{and was able to}} do it; end of story." [...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series. It's kind of fun to discover how the show is put together and how an adult woman snagged one of the coolest jobs in the world [...] If only it wasn't all so relentlessly perky." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Pru {{received}} {{positive feedback}} from music critics. Ed Hogan praised Pru's experimentation with musical genres. In discussing its many influences, Colin Ross {{wrote that the}} album never sounded uneven or disjointed. He commended the singer for communicating a range of emotions, by turns seeming [...] "innocent, self-assured, uncertain, elated and vulnerable", praising in particular the album's instrumentation and lyrics. A Billboard writer described Pru as [...] "sparkl with colorfully imaged songs about love won, lost and anticipated". USA Todays Steve Jones praised the performer for the [...] "remarkable depth in her poetics about joy and heartbreak". Jones wrote that the album demonstrated that Pru had {{a clear sense of}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> achieve for her career and sound. Ebonys Lynn Norment described her as possessing a [...] "rich, earthy voice and lyrical talent", responding positively to the artist's influences from scripture and poetry. A writer for Sister 2 Sister commended Pru for her ability to convey emotion to the listener, and identified [...] "Prophecy of a Flower" [...] as their favorite track from the album. The Houston Press' Craig D. Lindsey praised Pru's music and live performances, describing her songs as [...] "soulful, earthy and organic" [...] and the antithesis to music such as Destiny's Child's 1999 single [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". The album was called [...] "rtful... stunning... sexy" [...] by a reviewer from People.|$|E

500|$|Tisdale's music, {{which is}} {{predominantly}} considered pop, has included ballads, dance-pop, hip hop, and rock influences. Boys, heartbreak, and relationship breakups are common themes in Tisdale's songs. She defined her music {{career as a}} way to connect herself with the fans and to inspire them. She claimed that, while Headstrong (2007) allowed her to [...] "learn [...] as an artist", with her second album, Guilty Pleasure (2009), she knew exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do as an artist. Tisdale has named many influences on her musical career, including Christina Aguilera, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Pat Benatar, [...] Pink, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Led Zeppelin, and AC/DC. Tisdale said that [...] "almost anything" [...] inspires her, but she is mainly inspired by female pop singers. She often co-writes the songs she records; for her debut album Headstrong, she had writing credits in four songs, while she co-wrote five tracks for her album Guilty Pleasure. The songs in which she has songwriting credits are often personal. In 2009, while discussing the songs she co-wrote for her second studio album, Tisdale said that [...] "a lot of the songs on the album [...] about survival and staying strong" [...] and that she wanted those songs to be [...] "a statement and a reflection of what [...] through over the past year and how [...] grown up." [...] She named the song [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song she co-wrote for Guilty Pleasure. She discussed the death of her grandfather in the song [...] "You're Always Here", which she wrote with her husband French.|$|E
500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

However, the recording of the album was postponed several times as Norwood felt that many songs wouldn't express <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell at this point of her career. [...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it. I'm not the little girl I was when I made my first record. My voice is a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm.
