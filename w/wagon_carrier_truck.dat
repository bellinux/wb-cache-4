The chance of hitting increases with each consecutive attempt, and if a hit is scored a second roll is made to determine if the target is destroyed. When opposing infantry come into contact with each other, each man rolls a single six-sided die to determine survival.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{decision}} tool for truckload carriers {{that can help}} control driver turnover rates. Our approach is to use an existing econometric method, along with the drivers' work data, to predict the quit probability of each driver on a weekly basis, so that carriers can identify a subset of drivers who are "about to quit" in a timely manner. Empirical results from two case studies indicate that our approach does a nice job of predicting driver exits, and that it may become a useful management decision tool.

50|$|Operated as {{a living}} museum, this {{organization}} {{is quite different from}} most traditional collections and displays of Canadian militaria. Almost every vehicle in the museum’s collection is operational, or in some state of repair or restoration. Many vehicles including the vintage Sherman Mark IV, Chaffee, M60 and Sheridan tanks, armoured personnel <b>carriers,</b> <b>trucks</b> and jeeps are frequently driven in parades and other ceremonial activities involving The Ontarios or other units of the Canadian Forces. Since most of these vehicles are ‘runners’, the museum's staff and maintainers are slightly less reluctant to let people climb onto and into their prized pieces than most museum curators. From time to time, a patron may even experience a ride first-hand.|$|R
