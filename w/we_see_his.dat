In this serial <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> daughter, Paula Quatermass, who works as an assistant at the Rocket Group, {{but there is no}} sign of a wife or other children. In the fourth episode of the serial he mentions that he never reached his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, tying in with The Quatermass Memoirs later assertion of his wife's early death.|$|E
25|$|Berossus' {{achievement}} {{may be seen}} {{in terms}} of how he combined the Hellenistic methods of historiography and Mesopotamian accounts to form a unique composite. Like Herodotus and Thucydides, he probably autographed his work for the benefit of later writers. Certainly he furnished details of his own life within his histories, which contrasted with the Mesopotamian tradition of anonymous scribes. Elsewhere, he included a geographical description of Babylonia, similar to that found in Herodotus (on Egypt), and used Greek classifications. There is some evidence that he resisted adding information to his research, especially for the earlier periods with which he was not familiar. Only in Book 3 do <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> opinions begin to enter the picture.|$|E
25|$|Book 3 {{relates the}} history of Babylon from Nabonassaros to Antiochus I (presumably). Again, {{it is likely that}} he used king-lists, though it is not known which ones he used. The Mesopotamian {{documents}} known as King-List A (one copy from the 6th or 5th centuries BC) and Chronicle 1 (3 copies with one confidently dated to 500 BC) are usually suggested as the ones he used, due to the synchronicity between those and his History (though there are some differences). A large part of his history around the time of Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar II, 604562 BC) and Nabonnedos (Nabonidus, 556539 BC) survives. Here <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> interpretation of history for the first time, moralising about the success and failure of kings based on their moral conduct. This is similar to another Babylonian history, Chronicle of Nabonidus (as well as to the Hebrew Bible), and differs from the rationalistic accounts of other Greek historians like Thucydides.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] shows [...] "just how dependent upon Smithers Mr. Burns is". He {{added that the}} staging and animation of the scene in which Homer tries to apologize to Burns [...] "will remain engraved in your memory {{in the same way}} as some of the series finest dialogue can". DVD Movie Guides Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and commented that [...] "any doubts about Smithers' sexuality will not last long when <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> vacation". Jacobson would have liked to see more scenes from Smithers' vacation, but he still thought the episode offered [...] "nice exposition" [...] for the character. He added: [...] "It’s fun to see more about his pampering of Burns, and it’s amusing to watch Homer take over for him." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be the scenes of Smithers on vacation. She concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it a [...] "very good episode, and an unusually straightforward one for this surreal season".|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs {{the way it}} does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “ Here <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E
2500|$|Paul, {{who called}} himself [...] "the apostle of the Gentiles", {{sometimes}} attacked the practice of religious male circumcision, perhaps as an entrance into the New Covenant of Jesus. In the case of Timothy, whose mother was a Jew but whose father was a Greek, Paul personally circumcised him [...] "because of the Jews". [...] Some believe that he appeared to praise its value in , yet later in Romans 2 <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> point. In [...] he also disputes the value of circumcision.|$|E
