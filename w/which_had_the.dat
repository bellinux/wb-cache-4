5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> goal of {{securing}} bases {{to be used to}} mount {{the liberation of}} the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) {{a referendum on}} independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E

5|$|Augusta Raurica and Aventicum {{were also}} the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> legal status of incolae (inhabitants) {{invested}} with the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were represented by a special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").|$|E

This excludes all natural classes of sounds besides voiceless stops.

5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{originally}} did {{not want}} to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with Sam Hamm <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters. Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite, removing Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax. Annette Bening was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer. Filming began in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E

5|$|Due to Bowl Alliance (predecessor to the Bowl Championship Series) rules, the Orange Bowl {{following}} the 1996 season was played on December 31, instead of January 1 or later. This {{marked the first}} time that an Orange Bowl was played prior to New Year's Day: there were two Orange Bowls in the same calendar year—one in January, {{following the}} 1995 season, and the other in December, following the 1996 season. The Orange Bowl Committee, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> fourth and sixth selections of eligible Bowl Alliance teams, selected Big East champions Virginia Tech and Nebraska, an at-large selection that appeared to be a national championship game contender before its loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following {{a short period}} of stability after the civil war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable difference was that the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> unintended consequence of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Examinations of {{the burial}} grounds, of which even the largest used {{continuously}} over periods {{of up to}} several centuries, contains no more than several hundreds graves, shows that the overall population density was low.

5|$|In 1996, the Orange Bowl had {{the fourth}} and sixth {{selections}} from eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The Sugar Bowl had the top two picks, while the Fiesta Bowl, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> top picks in 1995, received the third and fifth picks. Due to Bowl Alliance restrictions, the Orange Bowl {{at the end of}} the 1996 season had to be played on December 31, marking the first time in the history of the Orange Bowl that the game was not played in January and that there were two Orange Bowls in the same year—one {{at the end of the}} 1995 season, and the other at the conclusion of the 1996 season. The only other time was in 2014, the first year of the college football playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot the scenes of Guevara speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in 1964.

Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult because it was a certain size and had a certain look.
