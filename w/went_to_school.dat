50|$|Children {{with disabilities}} are less likely <b>to</b> attend <b>school</b> than non-disabled children. Education {{completion}} gaps are found across all age groups in all settings, with the pattern more pronounced in poorer countries.

50|$|Kannada {{does not}} have any semantically {{negative}} words such as 'never', 'no one', and 'nothing'. These words are expressed by negating the verb with the positive equivalent of the negative word.

Similarly, for 'no one <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> on Sundays', one says 'anyone does not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> on Sundays' ('ಯರೂ ವಿದ್ಯಲಯಕ್ಕೆ ಭಾನವಾರಗಳ ಮೇಲೆ ಹೋಗುವದಿಲ್ಲ').|$|R

5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> at Sherborne, and, it was presumed {{by the family}} that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|E

At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E
