5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E

The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors {{tell the story of}} what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II. Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.|$|E
25|$|The Underground Literary Alliance is a Philadelphia-based {{and internationally}} {{membered}} group of writers, zinesters and DIY writers.

25|$|The Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in Gryon, Switzerland {{is led by}} one of {{his daughters}} and sons-in-law as a {{small-scale}} alternative to the original L'Abri Fellowship International, which is still operating in nearby Huemoz-sur-Ollon and other places in the world. Covenant Theological Seminary has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L'Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate compassionately and defend reasonably <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> claims of Christ on all of life.|$|E
25|$|Even {{among those}} reconstructionist groups who see {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E

50|$|There {{are fewer}} debates on animal sources, as {{historically}} laboratory animals {{have been used}} to develop organ transplantation technologies for prolonging human life, such as using animal organs in xenotransplantation on human. Nevertheless, animal rights activists have objections on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> animal abuse such as organ harvesting in bear farms, and religious groups object <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> consumption of dirty animals.|$|R

25|$|With secession, many Quebec nationalists {{think they}} have the answer to Canada's continual {{constitutional}} debate. Marginalized after the Patriotes rebellion of 1837–38, the secessionist option was resurrected as a credible solution {{in the wake of the}} 1960s Quiet Revolution of Quebec. Some politicians see the independence as the normal conclusion of the Quebec struggle for the conservation of its autonomy within the Canadian federal framework. Some see it in a broader perspective of every people's right to self-determination and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> normal evolution of a 400-year-old former French colony that fell victim to the colonial wars between Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|Both FIFA and UEFA have awards {{which they}} {{hand out to}} {{individuals}} or groups {{of people who have}} promoted <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> spirit of Fair Play, both within and outside of football. An example of this was the Italian player Paolo Di Canio who, while not given an award, was congratulated by many sections of the football world for a generous display of Fair Play. Despite having a goal scoring opportunity while playing for West Ham United against Everton, when Di Canio saw the Everton goalkeeper had picked up an injury, instead of scoring what could have been the easiest goal of his career, he caught the ball, thus stopping play and allowing the goalkeeper to receive treatment.|$|E
25|$|Sovereigntists are {{moderate}} nationalists who do {{not believe}} Canada to be reformable {{in a way that}} could answer <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> legitimate wish of Quebecers to govern themselves freely. They opt for the independence of Quebec; however, {{at the same time they}} insist on offering an economic and political partnership to the rest of Canada on the basis of the equality of both nations. The political parties created by the sovereigntists created are the Bloc Québécois and the Parti Québécois, which its members define as a party of social democratic tendency. The Parti Québécois organized a 1980 referendum and a 1995 referendum, each of which could have led to negotiations for independence had it succeeded. The No side prevailed in both, but its margin was very narrow in the second referendum (50.6% No, 49.4% Yes). Sovereigntists find their ideological origins in the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, René Lévesque's short-lived precursor to the Parti Québécois.|$|E

25|$|A {{full-length}} runway {{extension to}} accommodate long-haul international flights {{has been previously}} investigated, but would require expensive land reclamation into Lyall Bay, and massive breakwater protection from Cook Strait. Doubts have existed over the viability of such an undertaking, particularly as Air New Zealand has repeatedly indicated {{that it has no}} interest in pursuing international service beyond Australia and the Pacific Islands, and few international airlines have shown serious interest in providing services beyond those points. Air New Zealand has questioned potential demand for such flights, citing the axing of its Christchurch-Los Angeles route in early 2006. Regional business organisations and the airport have put forward their case to various international airlines for long-haul operations to and from Wellington, pointing out that Christchurch's economy is mainly industrial and agricultural, while arguing that Wellington's economy is based mainly on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> higher-value public service, financial, ICT, and creative sectors. In particular, a survey commissioned by the Wellington Chamber of Commerce found that respondents regarded the airport's limited international capacity as the biggest obstacle to the Wellington region's economic potential, by a long margin over other factors. It has also been pointed out that while Air New Zealand has been scaling back certain routes, it is adding others, most notably Auckland-Shanghai from 6 November 2006.|$|E

As part of the pivot to the Pacific, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said that the Navy would switch from a 50/50 split between the Pacific and the Atlantic to a 60/40 percent split that favored the Pacific, but the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have said that this would not mean [...] "a big influx of troops or ships in the Western Pacific". This pivot is a continuation of the trend towards the Pacific that first saw the Cold War's focus against the Soviet Union with 60 percent of the American submarine fleet stationed in the Atlantic shift towards an even split between the coasts and then in 2006, 60 percent of the submarines stationed on the Pacific side to counter China. The pivot is not entirely about numbers as some of the most advanced platforms will now have a Pacific focus, where their capabilities are most needed. However even a single incident can make a big dent in a fleet of modest size with global missions.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} successes of Tleilaxu genetic engineering, the slig is a hybrid livestock animal—a cross between a large slug and a Terran pig—first mentioned in Heretics of Dune and considered a delicacy: 'The sweetest meat this side of heaven.' Most people had {{thought that they were}} [...] "tank-bred mutations", [...] "ugly creatures who excreted slimy, foul-smelling residue, and whose multiple mouths ground incessantly on garbage", even though they enjoy devouring the flesh of these beasts (marinated slig medallions in rich Caladan wine sauces are considered a prime delicacy). Despite being the producers of sligs, the Tleilaxu themselves do not consume the animals, having designed them to facilitate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> degrading decadence and spiritual bankruptcy of all cultures but their own.|$|E
2500|$|Theosophical organisations {{claim that}} Theosophy {{is not a}} religion. Instead they regard it as a system that embraces <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> [...] "essential truth" [...] {{underlying}} religion, philosophy, and science. As a result, they allow their members to hold other religious allegiances. However, in his history of the Theosophical movement, the religious studies scholar Bruce F. Campbell referred to Theosophy as [...] "an esoteric religious tradition". Similarly, Godwin {{described it as a}} [...] "universally eclectic religious movement". Campbell noted that despite the fact that Theosophists do not refer to the movement as a religion, it promoted [...] "a religious world-view" [...] using [...] "explicitly religious terms". Bolstering his description of it as a religion, he noted that its central tenets are not unequivocal fact, but rather rely on belief.|$|E
