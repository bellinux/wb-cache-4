50|$|The Angat Watershed {{supports}} {{a variety of}} wildlife thanks to its location in the Sierra Madre and its rich hydrology and terrestrial ecology coated by lowland dipterocarp forests, submontane forests, grasslands, secondary bamboo and scrublands. It is home to 290 endemic species of woody and non-woody plants, including the <b>white</b> <b>lauan</b> (known locally as bagtikan), tanguile, yakal, acacia and narra. A good area for bird-watching, the Angat reserve attracts 43 different bird species, {{many of which are}} threatened or restricted. In addition to the two most visible birds in the reserve, the Luzon hornbill (known locally as kalao) and the Rufous hornbill, the reserve also attracts large flocks of spotted imperial pigeon, scale-feathered malkoha, rough-crested malkoha, grey-backed tailorbird, and Philippine eagle owl. These avian species are all endemic to the Philippines, with the Luzon hornbill and Philippine eagle-owl classified as near-threatened and vulnerable. The data-deficient Worcester's buttonquail has also been recorded in the watershed, as well as the Philippine hawk-eagle, Philippine dwarf kingfisher, green racket-tail, whiskered pitta, celestial monarch, ashy thrush, ashy-breasted flycatcher, flame-breasted fruit dove, and green-faced parrotfinch.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{church and}} convent built by Libagonons were of wooden structure. [...] "The {{tradition}} of building wooden churches date {{back from the}} Middle Ages until {{the turn of the}} 18th century. The skills, knowledge and experience to build an ample log structure were performances out of the ordinary". (See: Wooden Churches of Maramures). As commonly practiced in the past, the construction of the church, chapel, convent and the town hall was made possible through bayanihan, a spirit of communal unity or effort to do a particular goal. A resident of proper age can volunteer at least a day in a week to a month to help or work in the construction. Usually on a Saturday, the volunteers ascended the mountains to look for timber for the church's pillars and some wood used in other means, like wood joints, posts, floors, etc. The wood found were Narra trees (pterocarpus), Molave trees (vitex parviflora), <b>White</b> <b>Lauan</b> (shorea contorta) and other rainforest trees in the forested mountains of Libagon. The largest pillars were huge trees bigger than the circumference of a man's (or two men's) outstretched arms. The task of dragging down the trees (with very strong ropes on both ends) from the mountainous jungle on narrow access was indeed a hazardous challenge to the men. In like manner, another group of volunteers brought gongs and drums to tap a repeated rhythmic beat and synchronized the pushing and pulling down of the timber while together they howled, [...] "HIIIIBOOOYYYY...." [...] While on an abrupt slope, restraining the heavy log is crucial to prevent it from running over someone and avoid breakage of the tree. Each of them brought their own food and an ample amount of coconut wine (tuba) stored in a baler shell or bamboo container to quench their thirst. Despite all these, the bayanihan spirit of the Libagonons rose above the arduousness of the endeavor and wiped out any exhaustion they felt.|$|E
40|$|The study {{revealed}} {{a total of}} 165 plant taxa from the floristic survey area. Of this, 68 or 41. 21 % were indigenous while 97 or 58. 79 % were introduced species to the wildlife sanctuary. Of the 97 introduced species, 20 are native to the Philippines and 77 are exotic. Eleven (11) species were identified as endemic, that is, they are only found in the Philippine archipelago. An assessment {{of the status of}} the different plant species was carried out to establish a foundation for their protection, conservation and monitoring. Assessment of the status of each species revealed ten (10) threatened species both locally and nationally. Among these three (3) are critically endangered or facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. These species belong to the family Dipterocarpaceae as follows: Shorea astylosa (yakal); Shorea contorta (<b>white</b> <b>lauan)</b> and Hopea cagayanensis (narek). All three species are endemic to the Philippine archipelago. Hopea cagayanensis is endemic only to Cagayan province. On the other hand, two (2) are endangered species or facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild: Diospyros philippinensis (kamagong) and Podocarpus costalis (igem-dagat) while five (5) are vulnerable or facing a high risk of extinction in the wild as follows: Afzelia rhomboidea (tindalo), Pterocarpus indicus (narra), Vitex parviflora (molave), Instia bijuga (ipil), and Ficus ulmifolia (tibig) ...|$|E
