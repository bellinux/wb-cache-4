The damage is especially serious in the district facing the Japan Sea where seasonal wind is very strong in winter. In order to reduce the strong wind which causes the blown sand, the <b>wind</b> <b>break</b> <b>fence</b> and the net are widely used. But such measures have a problem that the perspective and the landscape at the coastline are much prevented. In this study, the new type of countermeasure for mitigating the environmental problems due to the blown sand is developed. Here, the blown sand is prevented by spraying the clod generated from the chemical industry as the waste. The performance of developed method is tested based on the data of field measurements and wind tunnel tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{running safety}} for high speed trains {{involves}} {{the evaluation of}} the overturning risk associated to crosswind aerodynamic forces. This study uses a numerical CFD tool to predict the shielding effect of wind-break fences on an ETR 500 high speed train. The analysis of the aerodynamic performances of the train is conducted by varying some design parameters of the wind breaks as the height of the barrier, the fence porosity and the inclination of the barrier slots. The shielding effect has been evaluated by analyzing the aerodynamic forces acting on the train. As a result it has been found that the shielding effect of a <b>wind</b> <b>break</b> <b>fence</b> can be maintained by reducing the porosity of the slots, while inclination has less influence on the aerodynamic forces on the train...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{obstacle}} arrangement on snowdrifts was experimentally studied at Syowa Station in Antarctica. Different patterns of snowdrift {{were obtained by}} changing the alignment of the obstacles. The author showed the distribution patterns of snowdrift {{in the case of}} a straight-line alignment of two flat boards and two different orthogonal arrangements of two flat boards, standing and lying cylinders, and a straight-line alignment of two rectangular prisms. The snowdrift was measured immediately after blizzards with maximum instantaneous wind velocity 31 to 36 m/s, mean air temperature for the period of strong wind over 20 m/s - 6 to - 10 ℃, maximum amplitude of wind direction 25 degrees and gustiness 1. 1 to 1. 3. The ridge of snowdrift in Antarctica was more distinct than that in Japan, because of the smaller gustiness and the less variation in the wind direction. The effect of the obstacles extended over the distance up to 20 to 30 times the obstacle height. This is similar to the effect of a <b>wind</b> <b>break</b> <b>fence...</b>|$|E

40|$|Stratosphere {{circulation}} {{is important}} to interpret abundances of photo-chemically produced compounds like ozone that we aim to observe to assess habitability of exoplanets. We thus investigate a tidally locked ExoEarth scenario for TRAPPIST- 1 b, TRAPPIST- 1 d, Proxima Centauri b and GJ 667 C f with a simplified 3 D atmosphere model and for different stratospheric <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> assumptions. These planets are representatives for different circulation regimes for orbital periods: P_orb= 1 - 100 days. The circulation of exoplanets with P_orb≤ 25 days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave in the troposphere {{and also in the}} stratosphere: It leads to a strong equatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that confines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the distribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited to an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with P_orb> 25 days, like GJ 667 C f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the stratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses. The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked ExoEarths with P_orb≤ 25 days can, however, be circumvented with deep stratospheric <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like on Earth. For planets with 3 ≤ P_orb≤ 6 days, the extratropical Rossby wave acts as an additional safe-guard against the tropical Rossby wave in case of shallow <b>wind</b> <b>breaking.</b> Therefore, TRAPPIST- 1 d is less prone to have an equatorial transport belt in the stratosphere than Proxima Centauri b. Even our Earth model shows an equatorial wind jet, if stratosphere <b>wind</b> <b>breaking</b> is inefficient. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how {{conceptions of}} safety in visions and {{strategies}} for public space {{in the city of}} Gothenburg result in measures aimed at reducing the visibility of certain behaviors that causes feelings of insecurity in parts of the population. In Gothenburg one such measure has been to build <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> intended for alcohol and drug users placed in the city’s marginal spaces. In this article I have focused on two cases where this particular measure has been carried out, namely the city districts Angered and Frölunda. By analyzing public documents and narratives of public officials through the orienting concepts of ordered-/appropriated space, inclusion/exclusion and borders I have identified three diagnostic frames that are being used in descriptions of problems associated with the visibility of drug and alcohol abuse in public spaces {{as well as in the}} process of formulating measures to solve these problems. These frames concern the appropriation of public space, threatful behavior and a wish to cherish the children and are to a varying extent represented in the decision processes that resulted in the <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> being built in Angered and Frölunda. The <b>wind</b> <b>breaks</b> are indicators of the apparent gap between vision and practice regarding the openness of public space, and also symbolizes the exclusion of marginalized parts of the population in the negotiations regarding the appropriate use of public space...|$|R
