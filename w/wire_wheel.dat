25|$|The center-lock <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{traditionally}} associated with vintage sports cars and racing cars, {{and for those}} of us of advancing years the blood is still stirred by memories of split-seconds saved by the deft application of copper-headed hammers to eared hubcaps. We also remember...|$|E
25|$|Rolls-Royce– Rolls-Royce of America Inc. {{was formed}} in 1919 to meet the growing U.S. luxury car market. A {{manufacturing}} plant was set up on Hendee Street in Springfield, Massachusetts, at the former 'American <b>Wire</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company' building. Over the years, the factory's 1,200 employees produced 1,703 Silver Ghosts and 1,241 Phantoms, with the first Silver Ghost chassis finished in 1921. The 1929 stock market crash led to the plant's closure in 1931. Springfield {{is the only place}} outside Britain where Rolls-Royce luxury cars have ever been built.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the Regal {{was offered}} {{in a special}} Somerset Limited Edition trim which {{featured}} unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, sport mirrors, and chrome Somerset badging. [...] The interior had tan and blue plush velour upholstery, brushed chrome trim, and additional Somerset badging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{with their}} {{excellent}} weight-to-strength ratio, soon became popular for light vehicles. For everyday cars, <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> were soon {{replaced by the}} less expensive metal disc <b>wheel,</b> but <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> remained popular for sports cars up to the 1960s. Spoked wheels are still popular on motorcycles.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} on most {{bicycles}} {{and are still}} used on many motorcycles. They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley in 1808. [...] Although Cayley first proposed <b>wire</b> <b>wheels,</b> he did not apply for a patent. [...] The first patent for <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> was issued to Theodore Jones of London, England on October 11, 1826. [...] Eugène Meyer of Paris, France {{was the first person}} to receive, in 1869, a patent for <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> on bicycles.|$|R
2500|$|From the {{earliest}} days automobiles used either <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> or heavy wooden or pressed steel spoked artillery type. The development of the quick detachable hubs of either Rudge-Whitworth or Riley design did much to popularise <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> and incidentally led to the fitting of [...] "spare wheels". [...] After their wooden spoked artillery wheels proved inadequate many US manufacturers paid John Pugh of Rudge-Whitworth royalties to manufacture <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> using his patents. Artillery wheels fell out of favour in the late 1920s {{and the development of}} the cheaper pressed steel wheels by Joseph Sankey replaced <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> wherever the premium price of <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> was not justified by their weight saving.|$|R
2500|$|On May 1, 1979, AMC {{celebrated the}} 25th {{anniversary of the}} Nash-Hudson merger and {{released}} {{a limited number of}} specially appointed [...] "Silver Anniversary" [...] AMC Concords to commemorate the event. The limited production models received a two-tone silver metallic finish, silver vinyl roof, <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, commemorative badges, and the interior upholstered in black or russet [...] "Caberfae" [...] corduroy.|$|E
2500|$|... 1981 models {{saw only}} minor revisions. Styling was {{unchanged}} {{other than the}} grille which remained egg crate style but now had larger sections. Refinements included redesigned front disc brakes for less drag and a translucent plastic master cylinder reservoir. The cruise control became equipped with a resume feature, while <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> covers had locking bolts to secure them in place. This was {{the last year for}} the Delco GM 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio option.|$|E
2500|$|... 1974 {{introduced}} the Valiant Brougham and its twin, the Dodge Dart Special Edition. Available in two- or four-door models, {{they were a}} compact luxury car meant as an attractive alternative to larger luxury cars following the 1973 oil crisis. The Brougham had generous chrome trim, a vinyl top, deep cut-pile carpeting, velour cloth upholstery, interior door padding, color-keyed or simulated <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, and a special selection of paint and trim combinations. Much of the optional equipment on a regular Valiant became standard equipment on Brougham models such as power steering, power disc brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, electric rear window defroster and an AM/FM radio.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} on most {{bicycles}} and still used on many motorcycles. They were invented by aeronautical engineer George Cayley and first used in bicycles by James Starley. A process of assembling <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> {{is described as}} wheelbuilding.|$|R
50|$|The cheaper family saloon and {{touring car}} models came with 19 inch steel {{artillery}} <b>wheels.</b> <b>Wire</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were available for}} an additional £7 10/-. All other models had <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> as standard, and Triplex Safety Glass throughout instead of only for the windscreen.|$|R
50|$|The Zephyr 1100 had a Z1 restyle in {{its last}} year of sale {{including}} a return to <b>wire</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>Wire</b> <b>wheels</b> also appeared on the 750. It was replaced in the Kawasaki UK range by the popular Z1100R styled ZRX1100 (later ZRX1200).|$|R
2500|$|There {{were four}} wheel options this year. The {{first was the}} [...] "custom wheel cover" [...] {{standard}} on the Base model, full styled wheel cover (stainless steel) standard on Concord D/L, the <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> cover standard on Limited models, and the 14×7inch [...] "Turbocast II" [...] aluminum wheels that were optional on all 1981 models. There were 15 exterior paint colors this year, they were Olympic white, classic black, quick silver metallic, steel gray met, medium blue metallic, moonlight blue, autumn gold, Sherwood green metallic, cameo tan, copper brown metallic, medium brown metallic, dark brown metallic, Oriental red, vintage red metallic, and deep maroon metallic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sedan and}} Limited wagon model were dropped, leaving the wagon {{as the only}} {{available}} version in 1988, its final season and now under Chrysler's ownership. The standard and only [...] I6 engine was rated at [...] and came with either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission with AMC's Select-Drive system. Standard equipment in 1988 that was previously optional included air conditioning system, rear window defroster, halogen headlamps, AM/FM stereo radio, light group (glove box, dome, and engine lights), and adjustable steering wheel. The following remained optional equipment for the 1988 production: power windows, power seats, power mirrors, radio with cassette player, cruise control, rear window wiper, wood grain side panels, floor mats, headlamp warning buzzer, intermittent wipers, <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, and a cold climate group.|$|E
2500|$|These {{scientific}} experiments {{led him to}} develop an efficient cambered airfoil and to identify the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift, drag, and gravity. He discovered {{the importance of the}} dihedral angle for lateral stability in flight, and deliberately set the centre of gravity of many of his models well below the wings for this reason; these principles influenced the development of hang gliders. As a result of his investigations into many other theoretical aspects of flight, many now acknowledge him as the first aeronautical engineer. [...] His emphasis on lightness led him to invent a new method of constructing lightweight wheels which is in common use today. [...] For his landing wheels, he shifted the spoke's forces from compression to tension by making them from tightly-stretched string, in effect [...] "reinventing the wheel". Wire soon replaced the string in practical applications and over time the <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> came into common use on bicycles, cars, aeroplanes and many other vehicles.|$|E

One {{example is}} cylindrical <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> {{meant to be}} pushed into a pipe of some sort to clean {{the inside of the}} pipe, but some ordinary, but mostly rather large, wood drills have threaded shanks as well.|$|R

60|$|Chatterer {{had never}} had so many {{surprise}}s--good surprises--in all his life, as {{since the day he}} had been caught in a trap in Farmer Brown's corn-crib. In the first place, it had been a great surprise to him that he had not been given to Black Pussy, as he had fully expected to be. Then had come the even greater surprise of finding that Farmer Brown's boy was ever and ever so much nicer than he had thought. A later surprise had been the <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> in his cage, so that he could run to his heart's content. It was such a pleasant and wholly unexpected surprise that it had quite changed Chatterer's feelings towards Farmer Brown's boy.|$|E
60|$|Chatterer was {{so excited}} he didn't know what to do. He raced around the cage. Then he jumped into the <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> and made it spin round and round as never before. When he {{was too tired to}} run any more, he jumped out. And right then he {{discovered}} something he hadn't noticed before. The little door in the top of his cage was open! It must be that Farmer Brown's boy had forgotten to close it when he put in Chatterer's breakfast. Chatterer forgot that he was tired. Like a little red flash he was outside and whisking along the snow-covered stone wall straight for his home in the Old Orchard.|$|E
60|$|Chatterer {{had stood}} it pretty well {{and made the}} best of things until Sammy Jay had found him, and Reddy Fox had made fun of him, and Peter Rabbit had peeped at him from behind the old stone wall. The very sight of them going where they pleased and when they pleased had been too much for Chatterer, and such a great longing for the Green Forest and the Old Orchard filled his heart that {{he could think of}} nothing else. He just sat in a corner of his cage and looked as miserable as he felt. He lost his appetite. In vain Farmer Brown's boy brought him the fattest nuts and other dainties. He couldn't eat for the great longing for freedom that filled his heart until it seemed ready to burst. He no longer cared to run in the new <b>wire</b> <b>wheel</b> which had given him so much {{pleasure}} at first. He was homesick, terribly homesick, and he just couldn't help it.|$|E
50|$|In 1956 the XK140 {{became the}} first Jaguar sports car to be offered with {{automatic}} transmission. As with the XK120, <b>wire</b> <b>wheels</b> and dual exhausts were options, and most XK140s imported into the United States had <b>wire</b> <b>wheels.</b> Cars with the standard disc wheels had spats (fender skirts) over the rear wheel opening. When leaving the factory it originally fitted either 6.00 × 16 inch crossply tyres or you could specify 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato CA67 as a radial option on either 16 × 5K½ solid wheels or 16 × 5K (special equipment) <b>wire</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Now we elbow our way {{among the}} throng again. It is curious {{in the most}} crowded part of a town to meet with living creatures that had their birthplace in some far solitude, but have {{acquired}} a second nature in the wilderness of men. Look up, Annie, at that canary-bird hanging {{out of the window}} in his cage. Poor little fellow! His golden feathers are all tarnished in this smoky sunshine; he would have glistened twice as brightly among the summer islands, but still he has become a citizen in all his tastes and habits, and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drowns his music. What a pity that he does not know how miserable he is! There is a parrot, too, calling out, [...] "Pretty Poll! Pretty Poll!" [...] as we pass by. Foolish bird, to be talking about her prettiness to strangers, especially as she is not a pretty Poll, though gaudily dressed in green and yellow! If she had said [...] "Pretty Annie!" [...] there would have been some sense in it. See that gray squirrel {{at the door of the}} fruit-shop whirling round and round so merrily within his <b>wire</b> <b>wheel!</b> Being condemned to the treadmill, he makes it an amusement. Admirable philosophy! ...|$|E
