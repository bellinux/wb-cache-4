5000|$|Ivory is a hard, white {{material}} from the tusks (traditionally elephant's) and teeth of animals, {{that can be used}} in art or manufacturing. It consists mainly of dentine (inorganic formula Ca10(PO4)6(CO3)·H2O)), one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks. The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin. The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, [...] "ivory" [...] can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed. It has been valued since ancient times for making a range of items, from ivory carvings to false teeth, fans, dominoes and joint tubes. Elephant ivory is the most important source, but ivory from mammoth, walrus, hippopotamus, sperm whale, killer whale, narwhal and <b>wart</b> <b>hog</b> are used as well. [...] Elk also have two ivory teeth, which are believed to be the remnants of tusks from their ancestors.|$|R
40|$|Writers from Central African Republic are {{virtually}} unknown abroad. This study {{focuses on the}} place and functions of the folktale in Goyemide’s two novels published in France in 1984 and 1985, Le silence de la forêt and Le Dernier survivant de la caravane. In both novels, folktales clearly belong to oral literature. Le dernier survivant is divided into four chapters, each offering an unusual mix of literary genres: Narratives, speeches, songs, chants, legends and folktales. Folktales are used as thread, an umbilical cord linking individuals to their past: the two folktales inserted into the first novel help the main protagonist find the meaning of life, {{and those of the}} dernier survivant reinforce the villagers’ ancestral ties of the villagers. The five folktales about the tortoise and gorilla, the wren, the toad and the lizard, are directly inspired by age-long traditions and offer words of wisdom. Those folktales are there as another way of telling life experiences; they have symbolic and prophetic functions, proclaiming the victory of the underdog and the slaves’ ultimate liberation. At the very moment the story-teller leaves the scene, readers remember his first prophetic words: Africans will eventually free themselves from the colonial yoke, the same way Tortoise got rid of the <b>wart</b> <b>hog,</b> the same way the wren signals the end of the storm, the same way African slaves ran away from the Tuareg slave masters...|$|R
40|$|Piglets {{appear to}} lack brown adipose tissue, a {{specific}} type of fat that is essential for nonshivering thermogenesis in mammals, and they rely on shivering as the main mechanism for thermoregulation. Here we provide a genetic explanation for the poor thermoregulation in pigs as we demonstrate that the gene for uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) was disrupted in the pig lineage. UCP 1 is exclusively expressed in brown adipose tissue and plays a crucial role for thermogenesis by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. We used long-range PCR and genome walking to determine the complete genome sequence of pig UCP 1. An alignment with human UCP 1 revealed that exons 3 to 5 were eliminated by a deletion in the pig sequence. The presence of this deletion was confirmed in all tested domestic pigs, as well as in European wild boars, Bornean bearded pigs, <b>wart</b> <b>hogs,</b> and red river hogs. Three additional disrupting mutations were detected in the remaining exons. Furthermore, the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions was clearly elevated in the pig sequence compared with the corresponding sequences in humans, cattle, and mice, and we used this increased rate to estimate that UCP 1 was disrupted about 20 million years ago.

40|$|Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) has {{received}} credible reports of individuals obtaining feral hogs {{from other states}} and illegally releasing them near the park boundary. These reports have been supported by the removal of hogs with physical and behavioral characteristics not common of wild hogs in GRSM. In 2001, GRSM established {{a partnership with the}} North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to survey for wild <b>hog</b> <b>diseases</b> and, in 2005, similar partnerships were established with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services. From 2001 to 2007, 497 wild hog serological samples (28. 4 % of all hogs removed) were collected and tested for swine brucellosis and pseudorabies. All samples were negative for swine brucellosis. Since 2005, 16 wild hog samples (3. 2 %) tested positive for pseudorabies and the most recent sampling indicates that the prevalence and distribution of the disease may be increasing in GRSM. The occurrence of pseudorabies in GRSM is thought to be directly related to the illegal release of feral hogs near the park boundary...|$|R

40|$|Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are {{considered}} an exotic, free-ranging ungulate distributed within numerous countries and continents {{to include the}} United States. The reproductive efficiency, lack of predators, land use practices for domestic livestock (e. g., feeding stations, introduced water sources, intense cropping practices, etc.), and diet are leading factors in the expansion of feral hogs throughout their range. Feral hogs negatively impact floral and faunal communities, agricultural lands, and residential and recreational areas to include concerns with public safety and disease transmission. My study objectives were to (1) assess feral hog abatement strategies by (A) evaluating trap designs with the inclusion of electrical fencing, and (B) evaluating candidate baits for feral hog-specificity, and (2) assess prevalence levels for feral <b>hog</b> <b>diseases.</b> I evaluated 3 corral trap designs differing in the addition of electric fence configurations. Feral hog capture success data were collected and used to determine trap design efficacy. Treatments evaluated included (A) control corral trap with no electrical configurations, (B) corral trap with 1 electrical leg, and (C) corral trap with 2 electrical legs. ANOVA analyses suggest no differences (df = 2, P = 0. 758) between trap designs; however, length of trapping effort (i. e., {{the number of days}} that trapping occurred) was a significant (df = 6, P < 0. 001) factor in determining trap success. Pre-baiting was an important factor in observed trapping success. Trapping success declined after fourth day of continuous trapping. I recommend short, intensive trapping efforts (e. g., < 4 days) when using corral traps in feral hog abatement programs. I also evaluated 14 candidate baits (with and without repellant) replicated 40 times to determine feral hog specificity. Three evaluated baits (i. e., PIGOUT? strawberry, corn, and rice) were selected (df = 2, P < 0. 05) more frequently by feral hogs than other combinations. Non-target species (e. g., raccoons) visited baits with repellants less (df = 2, P < 0. 05) than baits without repellants. Repellant had no direct impact on feral hog visitation at bait sites. Trapping data also suggests that grains commonly farmed in local or regional areas {{are more likely to be}} consumed by feral hogs and, therefore considered in baiting options. Finally, of 412 feral hogs captured, 86 were sampled for prevalence of pseudorabies and Brucella suis. The prevalence of pseudorabies and B. suis was 20. 9 % and 13. 9 %, respectively within the study area. Based on disease study results, I recommend that natural resource managers take necessary precautions to protect themselves by wearing protective equipment and equipment and properly cooking feral hog meat. Additionally, resource managers should properly administer vaccinations to domestic and companion animals, and restricting domestic and companion animals from areas of high risk (e. g., carcasses of dead hogs and wallows) ...|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) is a severe viral disease in pigs, causing great economic losses worldwide each year. The causative {{agent of the}} disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV), {{is a member of}} the family Arteriviridae. Here we report our investigation of the unparalleled large-scale outbreaks of an originally unknown, but so-called "high fever" disease in China in 2006 with the essence of PRRS, which spread to more than 10 provinces (autonomous cities or regions) and affected over 2, 000, 000 pigs with about 400, 000 fatal cases. Different from the typical PRRS, numerous adult sows were also infected by the "high fever" disease. This atypical PRRS pandemic was initially identified as a <b>hog</b> cholera-like <b>disease</b> manifesting neurological symptoms (e. g., shivering), high fever (40 - 42 degrees C), erythematous blanching rash, etc. Autopsies combined with immunological analyses clearly showed that multiple organs were infected by highly pathogenic PRRSVs with severe pathological changes observed. Whole-genome analysis of the isolated viruses revealed that these PRRSV isolates are grouped into Type II and are highly homologous to HB- 1, a Chinese strain of PRRSV (96. 5 % nucleotide identity). More importantly, we observed a unique molecular hallmark in these viral isolates, namely a discontinuous deletion of 30 amino acids in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP 2). Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report documenting the 2006 epidemic of atypical PRRS outbreak in China and identifying the 30 amino-acid deletion in NSP 2, a novel determining factor for virulence which may be implicated in the high pathogenicity of PRRSV, and will stimulate further study by using the infectious cDNA clone technique...|$|R

40|$|Growth rates, {{measures}} of ascarid burden, and {{the levels of}} anteroventral pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis at slaughter were determined for 352 hogs born between March 8 and March 28, 1987 on 15 farms located in Prince Edward Island. Regression analyses {{were used to determine}} associations between average daily gain (ADG) and independent variables controlling for sex, farm, and litters nested within farm. The regression model accounted for 75. 4 % of the variation in ADG. The number of intestinal ascarids at slaughter did not affect ADG. However, the "life-time burden" (a composite measure based on fecal egg counts and duration of infection) was associated with ADG (p less than 0. 05) in a quadratic manner. Although heavy ascarid burdens decreased the growth rate of swine, the magnitude of the effect was minimal. The maximum improvement one could expect from reducing the ascarid burden on heavily infected farms would be less than 1 %. Severe atrophic rhinitis and the presence of anteroventral pneumonia each had a detrimental effect on ADG (p less than 0. 001). The corresponding reductions in mean ADG were 7. 7 % and 2. 8 % respectively. There was significant interaction between the effects of atrophic rhinitis and anteroventral pneumonia on ADG (p less than 0. 05). Hogs with both anteroventral pneumonia and severe atrophic rhinitis had a 17. 6 % lower ADG than <b>hogs</b> with neither <b>disease.</b> There is much greater potential for improvement in ADG through control of respiratory diseases than through control of ascariasis...|$|R
40|$|Feral swine (Sus scrofa) populations occur {{throughout}} eastern, central, {{and southern}} Texas, and their populations {{appear to be}} increasing. Despite their abundance and wide distribution, {{little is known about}} their range and interaction with domestic animals. In the last decade the national pork production industry has enforced an eradication program for economically detrimental swine diseases such as pseudorabies and brucellosis. It is hypothesized that feral hogs can be reservoirs that could reintroduce diseases to disease-free domestic swine herds. The objectives of this on-going project are to determine the prevalence of selected swine diseases that exist within feral hog populations in eastern and southern Texas and to determine the potential for disease transmission between feral and domestic swine. To date, feral hogs were trapped and ear-tagged (N = 212), and blood was obtained (N = 163) for serology testing for pseudorabies, brucellosis, and classic swine fever (CSF). Selected adults (N = 57) were fitted with GPS telemetry collars and released at their capture site. Prevalence of brucellosis and pseudorabies was 23. 5 % and 22. 5 %, respectively, for feral hogs in Texas. Of the <b>hogs</b> exposed to <b>disease,</b> feral <b>hogs</b> from southern Texas were 3 times as likely to have been exposed to pseudorabies than brucellosis; whereas, the opposite occurred for feral hogs from eastern Texas, which were 3 {{times more likely to have}} been exposed to brucellosis than pseudorabies. Prevalence of CSF in feral hogs is pending. Movements of feral hogs in southern Texas indicate that the potential for disease transmission to domestic pigs exists.
