The cross-connect circuits are made of a multi-wavelength channel selective switch consisting of cascaded hitless WSSs, and a multi-port switch. These switching elements are realized through the individual Thermo-Optic (TO) tuning of a series-coupled microring resonator, and can switch arbitrary wavelength channels without blocking other wavelength channels during tuning. We demonstrate a four <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switch</b> using a parallel topology of double series coupled microring resonators and a three <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switch</b> using a parallel topology of quadruple series coupled microring resonators.

We have proposed and demonstrated a vertically coupled microring resonator as an Add/Drop filter, and recently realized a hitless wavelength channel selective switch (hitless tunable Add/Drop filter) using Thermo-Optic (TO) effect of double series coupled dielectric microring resonator. Using a high-index dielectric material as the core, the response time was reduced to 105 μs (rise time) and 15 μs (fall time), which are fifteen-fold and hundred-fold faster than that of polymer material, and the reproducibility by the heat cycle test was also improved to less than 0. 01 nm.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{experimentally}} demonstrates flexible-bandwidth networking by splitting a 500 -GHz waveform {{generated by}} optical arbitrary waveform generation into its two tributary spectral slices using a liquid-crystal spatial light phase modulator as a <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switch.</b> Rapid increases in Internet traffic coupled with dynamic traffic demands require efficient and scalable transport links to support future optical networks. Wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) technology [1] has had success {{in meeting the}} exponentially growing capacity requirements, but lacks the optimization for dynamically changing traffic demands. Flexible bandwidth networks, in which a broad spectrum is composed of arbitrarily assigned spectral slices, can replace fixed wavelength grids to support elastic traffic demands [2] ranging from extremely low capacity (sub-wavelength) to very high capacity (hyper-wavelength). Optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) has proven its capability of creating arbitrary waveforms through line-by-line intensity and phase modulations of broad-bandwidth, coherent optical frequency combs (OFC). With an arbitrary <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switch</b> (WSS), the transmitted spectrum {{can be divided into}} spectral slices of arbitrary sizes. In this summary, a terahertz OAWG-based transmitter [3] is used to generate a 500 -GHz waveform that is split into its two tributary signals using a liquid-crystal spatial light phase modulator (LC-SLPM) based WSS.

The choice for such bit rate and modulation format {{has been driven by}} the 50 GHz bandwidth of the filters (in the ITU DWDM grid) and by simplicity and low cost, respectively. The system, investigated experimentally and numerically, comprises 4 spans of standard fiber and a concatenation of 7 dispersion compensating modules, 4 <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switch</b> reconfigurable optical add and drop multiplexers, 9 erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and 1 WDM-DEMUX (> 75 GHz bandwidth). We demonstrate the feasibility of such bit rate upgrade in a cost-effective network planning strategy, which may be more adequate for regions where the demand for bandwidth do not require a jump to higher capacities (i. e. 40 and 100 Gb/s), thus allowing for reusing the 10 Gb/s installed infrastructure.

The MEMS mirror is used in conjunction with a Linear Variable Filter (LVF) to scan a particular range of IR radiation. By detecting the transmission spectrum within the IR radiation band, detection of gases based on their unique radiation absorption pattern can be carried out.

40|$|<b>Wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switches</b> (WSSs) {{that are}} {{integrated}} in reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) induce penalties on the optical signal due to tight optical filtering, which increases as several ROADMs are cascaded in a meshed network. In this letter, we propose and analyze possible configurations for the mitigation of these penalties in optical domain using optical wave shaper (WS). Including one WS in every ROADM node allows transmission of 28 and 32 GBd signals, which are QPSK, 8 -QAM, or 16 -QAM modulated, through {{a cascade of}} 32 and 14 WSS filters, respectively.

40|$|Flexible grid optical {{networks}} allow {{a better}} exploitation of fiber capacity, by enabling a denser frequency allocation. A tighter channel spacing, however, requires narrower filters, which increase linear intersymbol interference (ISI), and may dramatically reduce system reach. Commercial coherent receivers {{are based on}} symbol by symbol detectors, which are quite sensitive to ISI. In this context, Nyquist spacing is considered as the ultimate limit to wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) packing. In this paper, we show that by introducing a limited-complexity trellis processing at the receiver, either the reach of Nyquist WDM flexi-grid networks can be significantly extended, or a denser-than-Nyquist channel packing (i. e., a higher spectral efficiency (SE)) is possible at equal reach. By adopting well-known information-theoretic techniques, we design a limited-complexity trellis processing and quantify its SE gain in flexi-grid architectures where <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switches</b> over a frequency grid of 12. 5 GHz are employed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for higher spectral efficiency in long-haul optical communications {{paved the way}} to advanced transmission techniques like orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) and Nyquist-WDM, and {{to the use of}} high-order modulation formats. We introduced the Time-Frequency Packing (TFP) technique, which goes beyond the paradigm of Nyquist frequency spacing, and allows QPSK to outperform M-QAM in terms of spectral efficiency at equal complexity. The use of bounds on the achievable information rate (AIR), numerically evaluated according to the auxiliary channel and mismatched decoding principles, provides a useful, fast and reliable estimation of the system performance, without reference to any specific employed code. We applied such an approach in the analysis of modern flexi-grid scenarios where cascaded <b>wavelength</b> <b>selective</b> <b>switches</b> (WSS) severely impair signal propagation.
