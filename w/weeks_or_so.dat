25|$|On 15 September 2011, astronomers, {{using data}} from NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{announced}} the first partial-eclipse-based discovery of a circumbinary planet. The planet, called Kepler-16b, is about 200 light years from Earth, in the constellation Cygnus, and {{is believed to be}} a frozen world of rock and gas, about the mass of Saturn. It orbits two stars that are also circling each other, one about two-thirds the size of our sun, the other about a fifth the size of our sun. Each orbit of the stars by the planet takes 229 days, while the planet orbits the system's center of mass every 225 days; the stars eclipse each other every three <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

500|$|It {{was a time}} of {{problems}} and conflicts for Megadeth, that in every two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> according to frontman Dave Mustaine, there were [...] "outrageous emotional interventions" [...] {{in order to make the}} group a democracy. Many band meetings during this period concerned Mustaine's creative control over a [...] "successful formula", so that the rest of the band could better exercise their creativity. Another problem was the indecision on where the recording would take place. Mustaine did not want to record in Los Angeles, so it was eventually decided to record in Phoenix, since the majority of the band resided in Arizona. The sessions for the album initially began in Phase Four Studios (Tempe) in January 1994, after a few weeks the sessions were moved to Vintage Recorders in Phoenix and continued there into May- this studio is often the location for scenes in the Evolver video.|$|E
500|$|Nests {{are lined}} with hair, wool, dead grass and many other materials. The eggs are a lighter colour than those of other corvids, being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker {{speckles}} ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet. Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies monedula average [...] and [...] in weight, those of subspecies soemmerringii [...] in size and [...] in weight, and those of subspecies spermologus [...] in size and [...] in weight. Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs, although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs. The eggs are incubated by the female for 17–18 days until hatching as naked altricial chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. They fledge after 28–35 days, and the parents continue to feed them for another four <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
500|$|Females perform most of {{the care}} of eggs and nestlings, though males take a minor share of {{incubation}} and brooding. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring [...] and with red-brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. The female incubates the eggs for 30days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For the first two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. The female does no hunting at all {{for the first three}} weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week or two, at which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36days, and the post-fledging period at least 36days with parental feeding for at least 22days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks' wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own.|$|E

Edwards qualified third, Montoya took fourth, and David Ragan started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Hamlin was scored thirtieth. The six drivers that failed to qualify for the race were J. J. Yeley, Scott Riggs, Michael McDowell, Jeff Green, Josh Wise, [...] and Brian Keselowski. Once the qualifying session completed, Sadler commented, [...] "I’m feeling Superman today! I could sit here and say it is me, or this or that, but [...] Todd Parrott is the man.

2500|$|Within a week {{of their}} return debriefing, the British Secret Intelligence Service and the Foreign Office again sent Reilly and Hill to South Russia {{under the cover of}} British trade delegates. Their {{assignment}} was to uncover information about the Black Sea coast needed for the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. At that time, the region was home to a variety of anti-Bolshevik. They travelled in the guise of British merchants, with appropriate credentials provided by the Department of Overseas Trade. Over the next six <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Reilly prepared 12 despatches which reported on various aspects of the situation in South Russia (now Ukraine) and were delivered personally by Hill to the Foreign Office in London. Reilly identified four principal factors in the affairs of South Russia at this time: the Volunteer Army; the territorial or provincial governments in the Kuban, Don and Crimea; the Petlyura movement in Ukraine; and the economic situation. In his opinion, the future course of events in this region would depend not only on the interaction of these factors with each other, but 'above all upon Allied attitude towards them...'. Reilly advocated Allied assistance to organise South Russia (now Ukraine) into a suitable [...] "'placed'armes" [...] for decisive advance against Petlurism and Bolchevism'. In his opinion: [...] "The military Allied assistance required for this would be comparatively small as proved by recent events in Odessa. Landing parties in the ports and detachments assisting Volunteer Army on lines of communication would probably be sufficient." ...|$|E
