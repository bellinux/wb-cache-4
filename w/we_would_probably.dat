Bede however made little acknowledgment of his debt to the Anonymous Life in either his prose or verse life, and indeed if we were dependent only on Bede <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not know the work ever existed. Stylistically the Latin of the Anonymous Life is not as grammatical and classicizing as Bede's Prose Life, and Bede went to some effort to 'improve' the prose.|$|E

The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them.

2500|$|Tomkinson {{thinks the}} impure motives behind {{the idea of}} God being pure spirit are only too obvious. He says it was {{originally}} a pagan form of self-flattery to imagine {{there was a little}} bit of God in us all. He traces its history from Nimrod, through Pythagoras to Pliny the Elder and tells how they loved to commission statues of themselves to impress others. Scriptural literalists (from Augustine to Richard Baxter) fall into a similar error of human imaginings. Yet there was always an underground stream of the truth. He cites the followers of Sabilis which <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> label Sabellianism. Also the Athrapamorphets. These truth-sayers were persecuted by the dominant culture due to the take-over of the church by the state and because the Apostles [...] "preached the faith in a personal God, but in that they clothed it within the appellation of several titles, it appeared more intricate and mysterious" [...] than it really was.|$|E
2500|$|After Operation Mongoose was ended, the Kennedy Administration {{made some}} {{attempts}} to mend {{relations with the}} Cuban government. As a number of documents released by the National Security Archive reveal, this happened fairly soon after the project ended. One document {{comes in the form}} of an options paper from a Latin American specialist about how to fix relations. The document begins by suggesting that, through the CIA's attempts to off Castro and topple the government, they had [...] "been looking seriously only at one side of the coin" [...] and that they could try the reverse side and try [...] "quietly enticing Castro over to us." [...] The document goes on to push for further studies into how exactly they would go about improving relations. The document also states the two possible outcomes that would come along with a better relationship with Cuba. The document states, [...] "In the short run, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be able to neutralize at least two of our main worries about Castro: the reintroduction of offensive missiles and Cuban subversion. In the long run, we would be able to work on eliminating Castro at our leisure and from a good vantage point.", the effort to mend the relationships would be framed heavily by the negative relations formed due to Operation Mongoose.|$|E

The McGinnis manners are not those which appertain to the caste of Vere de Vere; but we rather like the urchins--there are eight of them--and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have gone over to talk to them if we had not had the fear of Aunt Susanna before our eyes.|$|E
60|$|Look at {{the analogy}} of {{domestic}} animals. That is the analogy to which breeding reformers always point with special pride: {{but what does it}} really teach us? That you can't improve the efficiency of animals in any one point to any high degree, without upsetting the general balance of their constitution. The race-horse can run a mile on a particular day at a particular place, bar accidents, with wonderful speed: but that is about all he is good for. His health as a whole is so surprisingly feeble that he has to be treated with as much care as a delicate exotic. 'In regard to animals and plants,' says Sir George Campbell, 'we have very largely mastered the principles of heredity and culture, and the modes by which good qualities may be maximised, bad qualities minimised.' True, so far as concerns a few points prized by ourselves for our own purposes. But in doing this, we have so lowered the general constitutional vigour of the plants or animals that our vines fall an easy prey to oidium and phylloxera, our potatoes to the potato disease and the Colorado beetle; our sheep are stupid, our rabbits idiotic, our domestic breeds generally threatened with dangers to life and limb unknown to their wiry ancestors in the wild state. And when one comes to deal with the infinitely more complex individuality of man, what hope would there be of our improving the breed by deliberate selection? If we developed the intellect, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> stunt the physique or the moral nature; if we aimed at a general culture of all faculties alike, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> end by a Chinese uniformity of mediocre dead level.|$|E

40|$|The First Commandment {{played an}} {{important}} role in the theology of Karl Barth. His personal obedience to this commandment contributed to his realization that one cannot be comfortable with the Liberal theology of the early twentieth century and accept the theological thinking that supported National Socialism. The First Commandment opened his eyes to see the idols, worldviews, ideologies and evil of his lifetime. The First Commandment is always in the background of his theology that concentrates on God’s revelation in Jesus Christ. Only two of his lectures specifically concentrated on the First Commandment, only one of which was published. Barth, understood the First Commandment as an axiom of theology. It is self-evident; a cornerstone and critical guideline for any theology that is built upon the biblical message. The article argues that if this aspect of Barth’s theology received attention in the Nederduitsch Hervormde Church, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> most <b>probably</b> have been saved from the conflicts concerning the ideology of apartheid and the “people’s church”.

30|$|In addition, in Antarctic achondrites, {{oxidation}} of Ce 3 + to {{the more}} insoluble Ce 4 + caused the separation of this element from the other LREEs, resulting in Ce anomalies (e.g., Floss and Crozaz 1991; Crozaz et al. 2003). The leaching of soluble elements from achondrites would cause low soluble element abundances with positive Ce anomalies. We expect that a similar process would occur in the CV 3 matrices we measured. However, a tendency for positive Ce anomalies to occur at low Ca, Sr and LREE concentrations was {{not found in the}} measured matrices (Additional file 1 : Fig. S 2). This indicates the same conclusion that Ca, Sr and LREEs would not be leached from the matrices with weathering grade W 1 during terrestrial weathering. Therefore, the Ca, Sr and LREE abundances of the matrices <b>we</b> measured <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> reflect preterrestrial processes, i.e., nebular or asteroidal alteration processes. Although only the CV 3 Red RBT 04143 matrix 6 shows a negative correlation between Sr abundances and Ce anomalies, it will not be discussed further because of its small number of data.|$|R

This mixture has an extraordinary effect upon character, and probably you want to remain as you are. Before I discovered the Arcadia, and communicated {{it to the other}} five--including Pettigrew--we had all distinct individualities, but now, except in appearance--and the Arcadia even tells on that--we are as like as holly leaves.

[...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "if there's milling cedar near the valley, our folks will make their bid. If Charters wants those rights, he'll have to put up the money, and it's quite likely we'll take them up in spite of him if I'm satisfied with my prospecting.

In the first place, a detachment should be sent off to the shore, with orders to annoy the enemy in landing; a strong party ought instantly to be thrown into the blockhouse, as the citadel, for on that all the different detachments would naturally fall back for support, as the French advanced; and an entrenched camp might be laid out around the stronghold, as it would be very unmilitary indeed to let the foe get near enough {{to the foot of the}} walls to mine them. Chevaux-de-frise would keep the cavalry in check; and as for the artillery, redoubts should be thrown up under cover of yon woods.
