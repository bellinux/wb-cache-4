5|$|Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) {{is brought}} to a maximum {{security}} military prison to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) to send U.S. troops on a mission in Burundi, resulting {{in the deaths of}} eight soldiers. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{discusses}} the design arguments, using examples {{such as the}} human body wearing out in old age as bad design.

25|$|On 2 May Haig {{thought the}} Germans “uncannily quiet”. At Abbeville (2 May) {{it was agreed}} that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if {{necessary}} and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French. Contingency plans were made (11 May) although it is unclear that they <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> been executed.|$|E
60|$|In a big {{forest in}} the north of America lived a {{quantity}} of wild animals of all sorts. They were always very polite when they met; but, in spite of that, they kept a close watch one upon the other, as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else. But their manners were so good that no one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> guessed that.|$|R

25|$|Allegations of SRA have {{appeared}} throughout the world. The failure of certain high-profile legal cases generated worldwide media attention, {{and came to}} play a central feature in the growing controversies over child abuse, memory and the law. The testimony of children in these cases {{may have led to}} their collapse, as juries came to believe that the sources of the allegations were the use of suggestive and manipulative interviewing techniques, rather than actual events. Research since that time has supported these concerns and without the use of these techniques it is unlikely the cases <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> reached trial.|$|E
25|$|Patronage was {{of vital}} {{importance}} to the growth and development of cricket in the 18th century. It is extremely doubtful if cricket <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> become a national sport without patronage and gambling. The key figures in the 18th century were the Dukes of Richmond; Edwin Stead; Sir William Gage; Frederick, Prince of Wales; Lord John Sackville; John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset; Sir Horatio Mann; George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and, into the 19th century, Lord Frederick Beauclerk. They were {{all members of the}} nobility or the gentry, they all played cricket (Beauclerk and, to a lesser degree, Dorset were very good players) and they all gambled on matches.|$|E
25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.|$|E

25|$|Olson, {{who had an}} {{extensive}} criminal history, was arrested on August 12, 1981, on suspicion of attempts to abduct two girls. By August 25, Olson {{had been charged with}} the murder of Judy Kozma. He reached a controversial deal with authorities, agreeing to confess to the 11 murders and show the RCMP the location of the bodies of those not yet recovered. In return, authorities agreed that $10,000 for each victim was paid into a trust for his wife, Joan, and then-infant son, Clifford III. His wife received $100,000 after Olson cooperated with the RCMP, the 11th body being a 'freebie'. In January 1982, Olson pleaded guilty to 11 counts of murder and was given as many concurrent life sentences to be served in Canada's super-maximum security Special Handling Unit in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, which houses many of the country's most dangerous criminals. Olson was a dangerous offender, meaning it was very unlikely he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> been released from prison.|$|E
25|$|Desperate {{to hold on}} to {{the last}} part of Jack she <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have,</b> Jennifer refuses to {{terminate}} her pregnancy. With the help of her new tenant and friend, Patrick Lockhart, Jennifer begins looking forward to a new life with Abby and the baby. When she is nearly full term, Jennifer gets a message on her computer, supposedly from Jack, and takes off to find him. She is picked up by a pilot who was to take her to the island of Melaswen. Unfortunately, the plane crashes, and Jennifer ends up in the jungle. She is thrilled when she reunited with Jack, and together the two begin planning a future for Jack Patrick Jr. (who is delivered by Patrick), but when they try to return to Salem, Jack is presumed dead on the return voyage. Jennifer tries to move on with her life, but finds it difficult because Abby can't forgive Jennifer for Jack's death. Jennifer is almost preparing to move on when a miracle occurs and Jack is back home for real. Together, Jack and Jennifer work on rebuilding their family, which is complete now that Abby are getting along much better with her mother. The two get a job offer for London, and Jack and Jennifer leave for London with baby Jack.|$|E
500|$|Many {{journalists who}} saw the film at Sundance speculated that it was likely that Disney would take legal action to prevent the film from being shown outside the festival, or perhaps even during it. [...] "Disney's lawyers are {{probably}} climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on Park City right now," [...] wrote McWeeny. Critics urged others present to see it {{before it was too}} late, and commented that it was questionable if those not present at the festival <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity to see it.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, former Marlboro {{marketer}} John Hogan {{disputed the}} claim that Pironi had gone back on a prior arrangement with Villeneuve. He said: [...] "Neither of them <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> agreed to what effectively was throwing a race. I think Gilles was stunned somebody had out-driven him and that it just caught him so much by surprise." [...] Hogan's company sponsored Pironi {{while he was at}} Ferrari. A comparison of the lap times of the two drivers showed that Villeneuve lapped far slower {{when he was in the}} lead, suggesting that he had indeed been trying to save fuel.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Benoît Melançon {{argues that the}} riot {{has become part of}} the [...] "Rocket Richard myth" [...] and has taken on an {{importance}} that, in retrospect, is far greater than it actually had when it happened. He asserts, [...] "Had there been no Riot, it is doubtful there <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> been a Maurice Richard myth." [...] The riot ended up taking on greater significance as time passed, but not for the reasons many nonacademic commentators believe. Richard was in danger of being forgotten in the years immediately after his retirement, so he promoted himself, and his nascent myth, excessively: ...|$|E
500|$|Garrick's altered {{version of}} the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century. Not until 1845 did Shakespeare's {{original}} return to the stage in the United States with the sisters Susan and Charlotte Cushman as Juliet and Romeo, respectively, and then in 1847 in Britain with Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Cushman adhered to Shakespeare's version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many. The Times wrote: [...] "For a long time Romeo has been a convention. Miss Cushman's Romeo is a creative, a living, breathing, animated, ardent human being." [...] Queen Victoria wrote in her journal that [...] "no-one <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> imagined she was a woman". Cushman's success broke the Garrick tradition and {{paved the way for}} later performances to return to the original storyline.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E
500|$|In her youth, Thompson was {{intrigued}} by language and literature, a trait which she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words. In 1977, she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, University of Cambridge. Thompson believes that {{it was inevitable that}} she would become an actress, commenting that she was [...] "surrounded by creative people and I don’t think it <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> gone any other way, really". While there, she had a [...] "seminal moment" [...] that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained in an interview in 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic, [...] "which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life." [...] She became a self-professed [...] "punk rocker", with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.|$|E
500|$|Despite these achievements, Jack grew {{weary of}} making films, and he sold a {{substantial}} amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966. [...] Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. [...] Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. [...] His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to [...] "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order. [...] Warner sold his 1.6million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot. [...] The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24million (equivalent to $ million today). [...] Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, [...] "Who <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?" [...] At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures' Harry Cohn.|$|E

500|$|After {{a year at}} RADA, Morrissey {{went back}} to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse. He then did Le Cid and Twelfth Night with Cheek by Jowl, and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with {{director}} Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in King John in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had often wondered at RADA if he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> the chance to act in classical theatre. His performance {{has been described as}} [...] "the most contentious characterisation of the production"; he received negative critical reaction from Daily Telegraph and Independent critics, but a positive opinion from the Financial Times. In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, [...] "The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking." [...] Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in Peer Gynt (1990). Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance. During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Fillmore was {{involved}} in the founding of the University of Buffalo, and became its first chancellor; he served until his death in 1874. [...] He had opposed the annexation of Texas, and spoke against the subsequent Mexican-American War, seeing it as a contrivance to extend slavery's realm. Fillmore was angered when President Polk vetoed a river and harbors bill that would have benefitted Buffalo, and wrote, [...] "May God save the country for it is evident the people will not". New York governors at the time served a two-year term, and Fillmore could have had the Whig nomination in 1846, had he wanted it. [...] He actually came within one vote of it while maneuvering to get the nomination for his supporter, John Young, who was elected. [...] A new constitution for New York state provided that the office of comptroller was made elective, as were the attorney general and some other positions that were formerly chosen by the state legislature. Fillmore's work in finance while Ways and Means chairman made him an obvious candidate for comptroller, and he was successful in getting the Whig nomination for the 1847 election. With a united party at his back, Fillmore won by 38,000 votes, the largest margin a Whig candidate for statewide office <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> in New York.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>have</b> a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E
