5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} <b>water</b> <b>just</b> above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the <b>water.</b> <b>Just</b> as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{the naval}} fleet in 1971 was a serious blow to the economy, and {{eventually}} the city controversially authorized the removal of many old factories, warehouses, and historic structures along the <b>water,</b> <b>just</b> west of the district boundary {{for the construction of}} retail facilities such as Brick Market Place and Long Wharf Mall, hotels, condominiums and America's Cup Avenue, a multilane through street whose name reflected the sloop races that then drew crowds to the city every few years.|$|E
25|$|At 11 pm in the moonlight, Equino {{had cleared}} for battle, stood in and bore {{down upon the}} three English ships. The English were {{surprised}} with many still on shore in the dark but as the Spanish approached, they placed and anchored themselves in seven fathoms of <b>water</b> <b>just</b> off a sandbar. Spanish combat tactics during this time {{was an attempt to}} grapple and then board. English tactics on the other hand was the heavy use of firepower to batter opponents into submission.|$|E

The body of the pilot was recovered soon after. An investigation was opened into the cause.|$|E

25|$|On 28 March 1658, while {{searching for}} the 68 {{survivors}} of {{the wreck of the}} Vergulde Draeck along the lower central west coast of Western Australia, Upper Steersman Abraham Leeman and his boat crew of 13 from the Waeckende Boey were inexplicably abandoned by the skipper, Samuel Volkersen of that ship. They were then about 180km north of present-day Perth. Their boat was in poor condition, they had no <b>water,</b> <b>just</b> a few pounds of flour contaminated by seawater, and some rashers of bacon.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped {{two inches of}} rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of <b>water</b> <b>just</b> {{three days before the}} scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 July, Biloxi catapulted two Kingfishers to rescue a pilot sighted in the <b>water</b> <b>just</b> off the {{southwest}} tip of Yap Island. One Kingfisher, flown by Lt(jg). R. Dana, spotted the pilot at 09:05 {{and was able to}} land just outside the reef line surrounding the island. A Japanese anti-aircraft gun began firing at the Kingfisher, but was soon silenced by four circling American fighters. The downed flier managed to paddle his raft through the breaking swells and across the reef where he collapsed from exhaustion. Lt(jg). Dana taxied between the raft and the reef and managed to pull the pilot in with a line. He took off at 09:40 and successfully returned to the task group later that morning.|$|E
50|$|They do not feed in {{very deep}} oceanic waters, and prefer shallow coastal areas and <b>waters</b> <b>just</b> {{off of the}} {{continental}} shelf break. When foraging at sea, the birds spend 90% of their time flying, and less than 10% of the time actually diving.|$|R

25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened <b>water,</b> <b>just</b> as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|McLain was {{suspended}} indefinitely by baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then {{set for the}} first three months of the 1970 season. He returned in mid-season, but struggled to pitch well. McLain then received a seven-day suspension (from the Detroit club) in September for dousing sportswriters Jim Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press and Watson Spoelstra of the Detroit News with buckets of <b>water.</b> <b>Just</b> as the seven-day suspension was about to end, he received another suspension from Kuhn, this time for carrying a gun on a team flight; the punishment would last for at least the rest of the season. McLain's 1970 season ended with a won-loss record of only 3–5. Later that year, he was forced into bankruptcy despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history. Meanwhile, McLain and his friend Jim Northrup co-schemed to make more money; they were back in Detroit furthering a plan that they shared to generate a nude baseball model calendar. These efforts eventually fell short.|$|E
25|$|The Pitmilly Lands lie on {{both sides}} of the Pitmilly Burn, a stream that joins the larger Kenly <b>Water,</b> <b>just</b> before the latter reaches the North Sea between Craig Hartle and Babbet Ness on the east Fife coast. The lands on the east side of the Pitmilly Burn border that sea. In order to define further the Pitmilly Lands as they have been known through the centuries, it is helpful to note that in the early 20th century, before it was broken up, the Pitmilly estate {{consisted}} of the manor house with its grounds, known as Pitmilly House, several farms, a flax mill and a grist mill, both of which may have been ruins then, and a fisherman's bothy. The farms, all of which are identified on the 2008 Ordnance Survey map, are Boghall, Falside, Hillhead, Morton of Pitmilly and Kilduncan. A possible source of confusion is that the Kenly Water has sometimes been known, and shown on maps, as Pitmilly Burn, but it seems clear that the Pitmilly Burn of the Pitmilly Lands is the tributary stream.|$|E
