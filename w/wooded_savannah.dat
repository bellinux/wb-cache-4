Inspired by the powers of the deity, the ostrich drew five trails on the ground representing the stars of the heavens.

30|$|Resistance to fire varies {{considerably}} {{according to}} the type of forest. Dense humid forests protect themselves better against all destructive agencies. Certain types of dry, closed, or semi-closed forests are very prone to fire damage. They deteriorate and become open forests or <b>wooded</b> <b>savannahs</b> but they survive somehow and, should the threat of fire be removed, could again become high forests. Other forest communities, on the contrary, may disappear altogether with great rapidity. This is the case, for instance, with the forests of western Madagascar that are almost nonexistent today, with the forests of the lower Congo and the Mayomba in south Africa, with Futa-Jalon in French Guinea, and probably with a great many others. Everything tends to show that these forests, so easy to transform into savannahs, are not in biological equilibrium with the present climate, which has apparently become drier than the climate prevailing during the remote epochs when these forests came into being.|$|R

The aquatic Madagascar Big-headed Turtle, Erymnochelys madagascariensis, occurs in rivers and large lakes in western Madagascar. These species all have delayed maturity offset by a prolonged reproductive lifespan. They also have a moderate annual reproductive output that includes multiple small clutches of eggs within a season, thus their intrinsic population growth rates are low. The last two decades have brought an increased under-standing of the demographic vulnerability of Madagascan chelonians to overexploitation. Particularly significant are the drivers of population dynamics relating to adult mortality and fecundity. The maximum level of harvest that their populations can sustain is low and is already greatly exceeded in most locations.

Spectral analyses of chromophoric dissolved organic matter showed wide temporal variations in the Oubangui compared to spatio-temporal variations in the tributaries, and confirm that different pools of dissolved organic carbon are mobilized during different hydrological stages. d 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon ranged between - 28. 1 per mil and - 25. 8 per mil, and was strongly correlated to both partial pressure of CO 2 and to the estimated contribution of carbonate weathering to total alkalinity, suggesting an important control of the weathering regime on CO 2 fluxes. All tributaries were oversaturated in dissolved greenhouse gases (CH 4, N 2 O, CO 2), with highest levels in rivers draining rainforest. The high diversity observed underscores the importance of sampling that covers the variability in subcatchment characteristics, to improve our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in the Congo Basin.

40|$|Tropical {{forests and}} other vegetated landscapes like grasslands and <b>wooded</b> <b>savannahs</b> {{play a major}} role in the global carbon {{sequestration}} process and their conservation and protection offers immense potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. This study aims to model the rate of vegetation loss as a result of diverse anthropogenic processes like urbanization, agriculture and infrastructural development in the fast growing city of Kaduna in northwest Nigeria. Land use change analysis between 1990 and 2009 is conducted and a transition potential map is produced based o n the established pattern of change and the land use change driver variables determined for the study area. This is achieved by a hybrid technique that integrates cellular automata, Markov chain analysis and artificial neural networks. The model is then us ed to predict land use change scenarios between 2001 and 2009. Model validation is achieved by way of computing the ROC statistic using the simulated and actual land use maps of 2009. Having obtained satisfactory outcomes, the model is then used to predict the urbanization scenario between 2009 and 2040. Interventi ons are then proposed to reduce sprawl and loss of vegetated land based on certain constraints placed on the land use change processes and the sim ulation is then run again to 2040 to produce an alternative scenario of land use change to serve as a basis for the implementation of the REDD project. The REDD model utilizes a methodology for calculating and evaluating net anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions due to the implementation of a REDD project. This methodology is based on the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund Project (BioCF) methodology for estimating reductions of GHG emissions for mosaic deforestation. Reductions in GHG emissions are calculated by subtracting the estimated carbon that would be saved through a REDD project intervention, along with the estimated carbon loss through leakage from the estimated carbon loss without the implementation of a REDD project intervention. The difference is known as additionality, and implies the net GHG emissions that are reduced owing to the implementation of the REDD project. The results obtained show significant reduction in GHG emissions based on the proposed planned interventions to reduce tropical land consumption and vegetation loss in Kaduna...|$|R

40|$|The Oubangui {{is a major}} {{tributary}} of the Congo River, draining an area of ~ 500 000 km 2 mainly consisting of <b>wooded</b> <b>savannahs.</b> Here, we report results of a one year long 2 -weekly sampling campaign in Bangui (Central African Republic) since March 2010 for a suite of physico-chemical and biogeochemical characteristics, including total suspended matter (TSM), bulk concentration and stable isotope composition of particulate organic carbon (POC and &delta; 13 CPOC), particulate nitrogen (PN and &delta; 15 NPN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC and &delta; 13 CDOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC and &delta; 13 CDIC), dissolved greenhouse gases (CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O), and dissolved lignin composition. We estimated the total annual flux of TSM, POC, PN, DOC and DIC to be 2. 33 Tg yr− 1 , 0. 14 Tg C yr− 1 , 0. 014 Tg N yr− 1 , 0. 70 Tg C yr− 1 , and 0. 49 Tg C yr− 1 , respectively. Most elements showed clear hysteresis over the hydrograph. &delta; 13 C signatures of both POC and DOC showed strong seasonal variations (− 30. 6 to − 25. 8 &permil;, and − 31. 8 to − 27. 1 &permil;, respectively) but with contrasting patterns. Our data indicate that the origins of POC and DOC may vary strongly over the hydrograph and are largely uncoupled, differing up to 6 &permil; in &delta; 13 C signatures. The low POC/PN ratios, high % POC and low and variable &delta; 13 CPOC signatures during low flow conditions suggest that during this period, {{the majority of the}} POC pool consists of in situ produced phytoplankton, consistent with concurrent pCO 2 (partial pressure of CO 2 ) values only slightly above and occasionally, below, atmospheric equilibrium. Dissolved lignin characteristics (carbon-normalised yields, cinnamyl:vanillyl phenol ratios, and vanillic acid to vanillin ratios) showed marked differences between high and low discharge conditions. We observed a~strong seasonality in pCO 2 , ranging between 470 ± 203 ppm for Q 3 s− 1 (n= 10) to a maximum of 3750 ppm during the first stage of the rising discharge. Water-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes were estimated to average ~ 105 g C m− 2 yr− 1 , i. e. more than an order of magnitude lower than current estimates for large tropical rivers globally. While our TSM and POC fluxes are similar to previous estimates for the Oubangui, DOC fluxes were ~ 30 % higher and bicarbonate fluxes were ~ 35 % lower than previous reports. DIC represented 58 % of the total annual C flux, and under the assumptions that carbonate weathering represents 25 % of the DIC flux and that CO 2 from respiration drives chemical weathering, this flux is equivalent to ~ 50 % of terrestrial-derived riverine C transport. Although tropical rivers are often assumed to show much higher CO 2 effluxes compared to temperate systems, we show that in situ production may be high enough to dominate the particulate organic carbon pool, and lower pCO 2 values to near equilibrium values during low discharge conditions...|$|R
