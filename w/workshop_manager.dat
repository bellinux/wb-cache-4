40|$|Prison labour, the {{traditional}} backbone of regime activities, {{has come under}} attack in several European countries. Workshops seem unable to impart the skills needed for a successful integration into the labour market, given that less than 25 per cent of inmates find stable employment upon release. The economic performance of workshops is also decreasing; several are even operating at a loss. The question has become: Is prison labour an inefficient and expensive activity that should be reduced in favour of better alternatives? Based on a field study in nine long-term establishments in England, France and Germany, the author {{stresses the importance of}} work for the rehabilitation of inmates and the safe management of prisons, and shows where improvements are possible.
