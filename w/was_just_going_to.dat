25|$|Across {{the line}} of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as {{defensive}} coordinator Marion Campbell called for an all-out 11-man blitz. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar {{to talk to him}} (the Giants player assured him that his team <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kneel again). Vermeil later said the blitz made the victory possible.|$|E
25|$|Speck had frequented Frank's Place, and {{the empty}} hog house {{was one of several}} he had helped build in the {{preceding}} month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce's death when he showed up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning. When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they found he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the past month.|$|E
500|$|Ben Stein's famous {{monotonous}} lecture {{about the}} Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was not originally in Hughes's script. Stein, by happenstance, was lecturing off-camera to the amusement {{of the student}} cast. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it off camera, but the student extras laughed so hard when they heard my voice that (Hughes) said do it on camera, improvise, something {{you know a lot}} about. When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had learned something about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

500|$|Holloman {{made his}} major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance. He made in three {{additional}} relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in 5⅓ innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming {{he was better}} in that role, and if he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and put him in for a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6–0 victory. [...] In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no-hitter [...] "the quaintest no-hitter {{in the history of the}} game," [...] saying that his pitches were [...] "belted" [...] all night but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense.|$|E
500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look like a man in drag {{for the rest of my}} life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1967, {{the group}} added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied {{with him at}} Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had {{performed}} at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of £30 per week (...) , and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for [...] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write. Just {{to try to keep}} him involved". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up [...] "Arnold Layne" [...] and [...] "See Emily Play", instead introduced [...] "Have You Got It Yet?" [...] to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.|$|E

500|$|Between 1901 and 1903, Leno {{recorded}} {{more than}} twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House {{to take part in a}} Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. [...] Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: [...] "How to Buy a House" [...] and [...] "The Huntsman". After the performance, Leno reported, [...] "The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn't do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn't intending to look funny– I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn't help myself." [...] As a memento, the king presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as [...] "the King's Jester". Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the king's reign.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{produced}} by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had served as showrunners of seasons three and four. They returned to the show to produce this and several other episodes while under contract with The Walt Disney Company. The episode was written by Reid Harrison and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It {{had one of the}} longest episode gaps between its conception to the time it was finished. The idea was first conceived at a story retreat. Jean found a copy of TV Guide while in the bathroom, with The X-Files on the cover. Feeling a crossover would be a good idea, he came back into the room, told Reiss his idea, and the pair pitched it. None of the other staff wanted to do it, so Reiss and Jean decided to do it themselves. Before the episode was produced, the script was sent to Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, who said that it was an [...] "honor" [...] to be satirized by The Simpsons. Jean was worried that the episode was not funny, as at the table reading {{there were only a few}} of the writers present and as such, the script got no laughs at all. It took a long time to come up with an ending, and an explanation for the alien. Originally, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be left as a mystery. Mulder and Scully's office was designed to be exactly the same as the one used in The X-Files. After it had been finished, Fox sent the episode out for a critical review, which was [...] "really great". The scene with the [...] "Homer is a dope" [...] T-shirts originally had an extra line: [...] "I told you, we're sold out!", thus filling in the plot error in the actual episode in which Homer asks for some T-shirts, despite just being told that they were sold out. The scene after Homer's first encounter with the alien, in which he runs through a field writing [...] "Yahhh!" [...] in the grass, was written by David M. Stern, and added in after the original read through.|$|E

2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just like I have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E
2500|$|In late December 1967, drummer Nick Mason {{approached}} Gilmour {{and asked}} him if he would be interested in joining Pink Floyd. He accepted and soon afterward became their fifth member; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter. One of the group's business partners, Peter Jenner, commented: [...] "The idea was that Dave would... cover for Barrett's eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write. Just to try to keep him involved". By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult, so Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and Andrew King to discuss the situation. During the meeting, Barrett agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him. Waters later admitted: [...] "He was our friend, {{but most of the time}} we now wanted to strangle him". Jenner and King, who believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, decided to represent him and end their partnership with Pink Floyd.|$|E

2500|$|While {{her film}} career was slowly taking off, Fischer took matters {{into her own}} hands, writing, {{directing}} and starring in her own mockumentary, LolliLove, her only directing credit. The film co-starred her then-husband James Gunn, as well as friends Linda Cardellini, Judy Greer, Lloyd Kaufman, and Jason Segel. She began participating in The Artist's Way, a self-led creativity seminar in book form. [...] "From doing that book I got this idea... When we started it, it wasn’t even {{supposed to be a}} real movie. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be an improv project for James and I to amuse ourselves with." [...] Utilizing a camera she gave Gunn as a wedding present, she filmed preliminary improvisational interviews with her friends in the faux documentary format that would later bring her fame on The Office. [...] "I really feel it was divine intervention that I chose to work in this medium for a year," [...] she said in an interview. [...] "It was the super best practice I could have ever gotten for the possibility of being on the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character.

But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The Shining had a {{prolonged}} and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography {{took over a}} year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Jack Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team would give to him to memorize, knowing that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days. Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the [...] "bar scene" [...] for six weeks, and that the shoot day lasted from 9a.m. to 10:30p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in his own sweat {{by the end of}} the day's shoot.

2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations.
