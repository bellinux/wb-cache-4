5|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, lines of {{communication}} were set up between the Navy and the Air Force. The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces, Vietnam.

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could not do so <b>without</b> <b>first</b> swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai.|$|E

5|$|The Ontario provincial {{government}} has quarrelled with 407ETR over toll rates and customer service, but is largely tied {{down by the}} lease contract. On February 2, 2004, the government delivered notice to 407ETR that they {{are considered to be}} in default of their contract because of 407ETR's decision to raise toll rates <b>without</b> <b>first</b> obtaining provincial clearance. The court's initial decision sided with 407ETR: on July 10, 2004, an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407ETR has the ability to raise toll rates <b>without</b> <b>first</b> consulting the government. The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6, 2005; however, a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13, 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|At around 10:00am, the Israelis renewed the attack, {{moving toward}} Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. The paratroopers at Jebel Mariam became engaged in intense {{fighting}} but, with their advantageous position, {{were able to}} repel the attack by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the Israelis concentrated artillery and mortar fire against the Sa'iqa positions at Abu 'Atwa and Nefisha. At noon, advance Israeli elements engaged with a Sa'iqa reconnaissance unit, and the Israelis lost two tanks and a half-track. At 1:00pm, an Israeli paratrooper company attacked Abu 'Atwa <b>without</b> <b>first</b> scouting ahead, and was ambushed and annihilated. The attack ended after paratroopers suffered over fifty casualties and lost four tanks.|$|E

In November 2010, Chopra entered into talks over acquiring an Indian passport in order to represent India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. However, without an Indian passport, and the Indian government's refusal to change its stance on dual citizenship, Chopra cannot play for India <b>without</b> <b>first</b> renouncing his British citizenship. In August 2014, Chopra stated {{that he wanted to}} play for India at international level, and was willing to renounce his British citizenship to do so.|$|E

5|$|Chrono Trigger {{takes place}} in a world {{familiar}} to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of Time, nicknamed the Epoch. The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period <b>without</b> <b>first</b> having to travel to the End of Time.|$|E
5|$|Congress tabled {{the draft}} of the {{declaration}} on Monday, July 1 and resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Benjamin Harrison of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence. John Dickinson made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence <b>without</b> <b>first</b> securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the Articles of Confederation. John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas <b>without</b> <b>first</b> gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E

5|$|In 1127 Theobald {{was made}} prior of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, {{following}} Boso's death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected {{him to be}} their new abbot <b>without</b> <b>first</b> consulting the Archbishop of Rouen, Hugh de Boves, who consequently threatened to void the result. Audoen, the Bishop of Evreux, and brother of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. Another problem then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.|$|E
5|$|In September 1887, Robinson {{wrote to}} Lobengula, through Moffat, urging the king not to grant {{concessions}} {{of any kind}} to Transvaal, German or Portuguese agents <b>without</b> <b>first</b> consulting the missionary. Moffat reached Bulawayo on 29 November to find Grobler still there. Because the exact text of the Grobler treaty had not been released publicly, it was unclear to outside observers precisely what had been agreed with Lobengula in July; in the uncertainty, newspapers in South Africa were reporting that the treaty had made Matabeleland a protectorate of the South African Republic. Moffat made enquiries in Bulawayo. Grobler denied the newspaper reports of a Transvaal protectorate over Lobengula's country, while the king said that an agreement did exist, {{but that it was}} a renewal of the Pretorius peace treaty and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to discuss the MSA of Africa <b>without</b> <b>first</b> considering the immense size of the continent. There are archaeological sites and evidence from across the continent, and, {{for the sake of}} ease, it has often been divided into five regions: northern Africa, which is often, though not without controversy, taken into consideration more so with Southwest Asia and Europe than with the rest of Africa; eastern Africa, stretching roughly from the highlands of Ethiopia to the southern part of Kenya; central Africa, which is arguably the least explored region, stretching from the borders of Tanzania and Kenya to include Angola; southern Africa, which includes the numerous cave sites of South Africa; and western Africa.|$|E

5|$|It {{was unclear}} how Hsu could have {{remained}} at large for 15 years {{and engage in}} prominent political activity without being detected. It was also unclear how a convicted felon, having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail <b>without</b> <b>first</b> having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E
5|$|The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) {{began on}} January 24, 1848, when gold {{was found by}} James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California. The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California {{from the rest of}} the United States and abroad. The sudden influx of {{immigration}} and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood <b>without</b> <b>first</b> being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories of}} Cú Chulainn's {{childhood}} are told in a flashback sequence in Táin Bó Cúailnge.

However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field <b>without</b> <b>first</b> asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a ríastrad and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.|$|E
