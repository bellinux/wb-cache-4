25|$|Whistler had a {{distinctive}} appearance, short and slight, <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies.

500|$|Lloyd {{described}} Martello as [...] "a lanky, hungry scrapper <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{the face}} of a dark angel, and a mouth like a bear trap", while in her encyclopaedia on Wicca, Rosemary Ellen Guiley described him as [...] "a colourful figure, known for his humor". Bruno described him as [...] "a loving man, yet sometimes caustic", stating that to know him [...] "was an honor, and ever a challenge".

6000|$|... "That's my business," [...] replied Cleve, slowly, and <b>with</b> his <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> on Kells he blew a long, thin, blue {{stream of}} smoke upward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Knights, she is your cousin, that I know, {{as surely}} as I know that she is my niece. Tell me now, is she aught more to you?" [...] and he searched them <b>with</b> those <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seemed not}} crazed, {{and there was}} that about his voice which rings in my ears like some oracle of fate. So wildly, too, he looked upon thee, Egypt, <b>with</b> those <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> of his, like one who loved and yet hated through the love." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{this moment}} a window-sash {{in the second}} story {{of the house was}} raised, and there, not thirty feet from us, stood an elderly female, wrapped in a gray shawl, <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> shining through great spectacles.|$|E
60|$|Lane was {{admitted}} at once {{into the office}} of Doctor Bronson, a little, gray, slight man with shrewd, kind eyes and a thoughtful brow. For years {{he had been a}} friend as well as physician to the Lanes, and he had always liked Daren. His surprise was great and his welcome warm. But a moment later he gazed at Lane <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Desoubrie was {{described}} as a short, stocky man <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> grey <b>eyes</b> set behind a pair of moderately thick-lensed spectacles. He was always smartly dressed, with his light brown hair always neatly combed. His smile revealed bright gold fillings in his front teeth and he spoke excellent English.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, an X-File {{regarding}} {{something that}} killed cattle and terrorized the human inhabitants of Point Pleasant, West Virginia {{was added to}} the cases. After witnesses described the culprits as primitive-looking men <b>with</b> red <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> they became known as the moth men. The case detailing this phenomenon was consequently filed under [...] "M", within the X-Files.|$|R
50|$|<b>With</b> <b>piercing</b> blue <b>eyes</b> and a Caucasian phenotype, First Lieutenant Raiford was mistakenly {{considered}} {{a white man}} and was, subsequently, appointed {{to the position of}} a company commander. In actuality, Raiford was of European/African-American/Native American lineage. He was a four-year college graduate and spoke conversational French, Italian and German; he could also read Latin.|$|R
60|$|It passed, and lo! by {{this same}} black rock stood another man, pale and eager-faced, <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> who reproached the worshippers in the Temple {{because of the}} wickedness of their hearts, and drove them from before him with a scourge of cords. This she knew was a vision of Jesus, the Son of Mary, that Messiah Whom she worshipped, for as He drove out the people He prophesied the desolation that should fall upon them, and as they fled they mocked Him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{very much}} {{disappointed}} I was when I beheld him," [...] remarked her husband. [...] "I had seen portraits of him, I had read and heard {{of his great}} achievements, and I had pictured to myself a hero. Perhaps my experience should have taught me that heroes seldom look like heroes, but for all that I had had my ideal, and in appearance this man fell below it. His face was of an olive color which was unequally distributed over his features; he was inclined to be pudgy, and his clothes {{did not appear to}} fit him; but for all that he had the air of a man who <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> saw his way before him and did not flinch from taking it, rough as it might be. 'You seem an old man for such work,' said he, 'but if you are strong enough to lift those stones why are you not in the army?' As he spoke I noticed that he had not the intonation of a true Frenchman. He had the accent of the foreigner that he was.|$|E

60|$|An {{hour later}} I rode {{up to the}} door of a long, low, mud-walled building, and was met by the trader, a bush-bearded, middle-aged man <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> gray <b>eyes</b> and sturdy, upright figure. This was Lorenzo Hubbell, one of the best-known {{citizens}} of New Mexico, living here alone, a day's ride from a white settler.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Daughter {{of kings}} likes you also, perhaps because you resemble--" [...] here he fixed me <b>with</b> his <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] "a certain kinglet of base blood whom once she also liked, but {{whom it was}} my duty to destroy. Well, I must think. I must study this world of yours also and therein you may help me. Perhaps {{afterwards}} I will tell you how. Now sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|The chief gazed solemnly {{round the}} store <b>with</b> his <b>piercing</b> black <b>eyes,</b> {{while all the}} other <b>piercing</b> black <b>eyes</b> around gazed at him expectantly! At last his gaze became riveted on a {{particular}} spot. The surrounding black eyes turned to that spot intently, and the chief said: ...|$|R
50|$|Yirawala {{often told}} witty stories {{and had a}} great sense of humour which {{prevented}} him becoming completely disillusioned with the commercial art industry. He is often fondly remembered as having a handsome and dignified face <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> shielded by an old bush hat.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{majority}} of its time as Tomb Raider: The Ride, the ride included four inversions, extended [...] "hang time" [...] over the lava pits, a goddess <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and fire and ice emblems, fog effects, and a synchronized musical score composed specifically for the ride, lasting 2:30.|$|E
50|$|Memnor {{appears as}} a kindly, golden-skinned giant <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes,</b> wearing a deep blue robe. He is subtle, intelligent, charming, cultured, articulate, and cruel beyond words. Many giants {{consider}} {{him to be a}} loyal servant of Annam, but this is a lie. Memnor, in his arrogance, wishes to usurp Annam and Stronmaus and become the new leader of the giantish pantheon.|$|E
60|$|Grandmother Newbury came to {{the door}} to meet her granddaughter. She was a tall, {{handsome}} old lady <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> black <b>eyes</b> and thick white hair. There was no savour of the traditional grandmother of caps and knitting about her. She was like a stately old princess and, much as her grandchildren admired her, they were decidedly in awe of her.|$|R
5000|$|He was no {{more than}} five feet tall, <b>with</b> black, <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and tangled hair, and gained a {{reputation}} for absent mindedness through his practice of reading a book while riding to church, not noticing when the horse wandered off the route. [...] Anderson was the founding minister of the Service Associate Presbyterian Church (later part of the United Presbyterian Church of North America) in present-day Raccoon Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania.|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard," [...] he began, and paused. For {{the first}} time in my life I saw him irresolute. He looked appealingly at the rector, who rose. Mr. Allen was a man of good height and broad shoulders, <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> black <b>eyes,</b> {{reminding}} one more of the smallsword than aught else I can think of. And he spoke solemnly, in a deep voice, as though from the pulpit.|$|R

50|$|Memnor is {{the giant}} deity of pride, honor, mental prowess and control. His symbol {{is a thin}} black obelisk.

6000|$|Lee couldn't {{quite make}} out whether this remark was {{intended}} for reproach or not, but she went on, quickly: [...] "I {{was just about to}} call. Indeed, I came to ask you and Mr. Haney to dine with us on Thursday." [...] She nodded and smiled at Mart, who sat with impassive countenance listening <b>with</b> attention--his <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> making her rather uncomfortable. [...] "We dine at seven. I hope you can come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{returned}} the housekeeper, hesitating a little, [...] "I {{thought we were}} as good as so. I wonder if I have no claim on the house and garden; though they say, now it is Harvey's, it will surely be confiscated." [...] Turning to Lawton, who {{had been sitting in}} one posture, <b>with</b> his <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> lowering at her through his thick brows, in silence, [...] "Perhaps this gentleman knows--he seems to take an interest in my story." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{judge was}} looking at Father Brown <b>with</b> level and <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "You are a most {{extraordinary}} witness," [...] he said; [...] "but {{there is something about}} you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth. Well, who was the man you saw in the passage?" ...|$|R
50|$|Whistler had a {{distinctive}} appearance, short and slight, <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and a curling mustache, often sporting a monocle and the flashy attire of a dandy. He affected a posture of self-confidence and eccentricity. He often was arrogant and selfish toward friends and patrons. A constant self-promoter and egoist, he relished shocking friends and enemies. Though {{he could be}} droll and flippant about social and political matters, he always was serious about art and often invited public controversy and debate to argue for his strongly held theories.|$|E
5000|$|He {{began his}} career in movies in Yves Simoneau’s Dans le ventre du dragon {{opposite}} such veteran stars as Rémy Girard and Pierre Curzi. <b>With</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and an intense physical style, La Haye emerged in the 1990s {{as one of the}} most versatile actors on the Quebec scene, winning a Genie Award for best actor in L’Enfant d’eau playing a mentally handicapped victim of a shipwreck in the South Sea Islands. He was also nominated for his deft comic turn as troubled photographer incapable of making a commitment in Soft Shell Man.|$|E
5000|$|Himmler's biographer Peter Padfield wrote: [...] "He Müller was an archetypal middle rank official: {{of limited}} imagination, non-political, non-ideological, his only {{fanaticism}} lay in an inner drive to perfection in his profession {{and in his}} duty to the state—which in his mind were one ... A smallish man <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eyes</b> and thin lips, he was an able organiser, utterly ruthless, a man who lived for his work." [...] Such was his dedication to the job that Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Höss claimed that one could reach Müller [...] "any {{time of the day}} or night, even Sundays and public holidays." ...|$|E
60|$|It was afternoon. Somerset {{walked from}} the castle in the {{direction}} of the wood to reach Markton by a detour. He had not proceeded far when there approached his path a man riding a bay horse with a square-cut tail. The equestrian wore a grizzled beard, and looked at Somerset <b>with</b> a <b>piercing</b> <b>eye</b> as he noiselessly ambled nearer over the soft sod of the park. He proved to be Mr. Cunningham Haze, chief constable of the district, who had become slightly known to Somerset during his sojourn here.|$|R
500|$|The {{official}} {{physical description}} remained unchanged, {{and is considered}} reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed {{on the same night}} in separate cities, and gave nearly identical descriptions: [...] to [...] tall, , mid-40s, <b>with</b> close-set <b>piercing</b> brown <b>eyes</b> and swarthy skin.|$|R
60|$|This was the lapse of Uriel, Which in Paradise befell. Once, {{among the}} Pleiads walking, Seyd overheard the young gods talking; And the treason, too long pent, To his ears was evident. The young deities {{discussed}} Laws of form, and metre just, Orb, quintessence, and sunbeams, What subsisteth, and what seems. One, with low tones that decide, And doubt and reverend use defied, With {{a look that}} solved the sphere, And stirred the devils everywhere, Gave his sentiment divine Against the being of a line. 'Line in nature is not found; Unit and universe are round; In vain produced, all rays return; Evil will bless, and ice will burn.' As Uriel spoke <b>with</b> <b>piercing</b> <b>eye,</b> A shudder ran around the sky; The stern old war-gods shook their heads, The seraphs frowned from myrtle-beds; Seemed to the holy festival The rash word boded ill to all; The balance-beam of Fate was bent; The bounds of good and ill were rent; Strong Hades could not keep his own, But all slid to confusion.|$|R
