Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his <b>wish,</b> but reveals that his <b>wish</b> must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original <b>wish</b> had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the <b>wish,</b> and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E

It is a fake 25-foot <b>wishing</b> tree made of plastic. This plastic fake <b>wishing</b> tree allows worshippers to throw their <b>wishes</b> to the tree, called “Bao Die” in Chinese. A traditional “ Bao Die “ includes an orange and it ties with a yellow paper. Worshippers can write their name, date of birth and <b>wishes</b> on the yellow paper and throw it to the <b>wishing</b> tree.If you can successfully throw the “Bao die” and it hangs up on the tree or its branches, the myth said your <b>wishes</b> can come true. However, if it drops, the legend reckoned that your <b>wishes</b> are too greedy. But still, if the “wishes” drop, do not give up, try more and keep throwing until you make your <b>wishes</b> success.|$|R
