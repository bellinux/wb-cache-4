5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the Army War College, and was then stationed in Bangkok. Having concluded {{that he would}} never be promoted to chief of station anywhere, and knowing he was tagged as a Thai/Lao specialist within the CIA, he settled into bureaucracy in his wife's hometown. His title was assistant chief of station, and special operations naturally became his beat. When Leka, the exiled monarch of Albania arrived to buy weaponry, Lair prompted the Thai quashing of the arms deal. Most of Lair's duties, though, required him {{to keep track of the}} drug trade in the area. For the most part, the Thai senior officers involved in the opium trade had been trained by Lair. They knew him <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his skepticism about banning drugs, and that he would not retaliate on them. They also knew the king favored him, and that Lair's in-laws were politically influential. Lair would simply ask these officers for needed information, bypassing all the rigamarole of tasking undercover agents to spy upon the drug trade.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a physiological understanding of hunger, Mindless Eating argues that much of one’s hunger is psychologically determined. People are not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> calibrated <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when they are full and {{even when they are}} necessarily hungry. As a result, they are subtly and unknowingly influenced by their environment when determining when to eat and how much to eat.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Sirop was Hubert de Givenchy's chosen {{successor}} {{as chief}} {{designer of the}} Givenchy label, but Bernard Arnault, head of the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy conglomerate which owned Givenchy, took the view that Sirop was not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> the public and appointed John Galliano instead.|$|R
60|$|He did not impart these truths without imparting certain tricks with them, which I {{was careful}} to imitate as soon as I began to write in his manner, {{that is to say}} instantly. His tricks he had mostly at second- hand, and mainly from Sterne, whom I did not <b>know</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> then <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their origin. But in all {{essentials}} he was himself, and my final lesson from him, or the final effect of all my lessons from him, was to find myself, and to be for good or evil whatsoever I really was.|$|R
500|$|In his memoir, he {{describes}} how one {{was an old}} friend who was keen to have children but feared she {{was running out of}} time. [...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> she would be a wonderful mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children."

[...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|On 9 August 1942, {{his orders}} were {{abruptly}} changed. MacArthur, now Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, had requested that a corps headquarters {{be sent to}} his command. Major General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., had originally been detailed for the assignment, but as Marshall informed MacArthur, [...] "Richardson's intense feelings regarding service under Australian command made his assignment appear unwise." [...] Eichelberger's I Corps headquarters was ready for overseas service and had training in amphibious warfare, and Eichelberger had experience working with MacArthur, so Marshall selected him for the job instead. Eichelberger was {{not happy with the}} assignment, especially when he found out about Richardson, and [...] "knew General MacArthur <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{that he was going to}} be difficult to get along with".|$|E

60|$|East of Budapest her {{complacency}} {{began to}} filter away, {{and when she}} saw her husband treating the Black Sea with a familiarity which {{she had never been}} able to assume towards the English Channel, misgivings began to crowd in upon her. Adventures which would have presented an amusing and enticing aspect to a better-bred woman aroused in Vanessa only the twin sensations of fright and discomfort. Flies bit her, and she was persuaded that it was only sheer boredom that prevented camels from doing the same. Clyde did his best, and a very good best it was, to infuse something of the banquet into their prolonged desert picnics, but even snow-cooled Heidsieck lost its flavour when you were convinced that the dusky cupbearer who served it with such reverent elegance was only waiting a convenient opportunity to cut your throat. It was useless for Clyde to give Yussuf a character for devotion such as is rarely found in any Western servant.

50|$|The late Devonian {{crash in}} {{biodiversity}} was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous: {{a recent survey}} (McGhee 1996) estimates that 22% of all the 'families' of marine animals (largely invertebrates) were eliminated. The family is a great unit, and to lose so many signifies a deep loss of ecosystem diversity. On a smaller scale, 57% of genera and at least 75% of species did not survive into the Carboniferous. These latter estimates need {{to be treated with}} a degree of caution, as the estimates of species loss depend on surveys of Devonian marine taxa that are perhaps not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> assess their true rate of losses, so it is difficult to estimate the effects of differential preservation and sampling biases during the Devonian.|$|R
