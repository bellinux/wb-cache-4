5|$|More recently, a {{specimen}} {{has been found}} in the Cerro del Pueblo Formation of Mexico, bearing several similarities to Ferugliotherium. If a ferugliotheriid, this <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the clade's range into the Maastrichtian of North America.|$|E
5|$|The Seventh Avenue Line Extension <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the Broadway Line {{north from}} 59th Street via a tunnel under Central Park to 72nd Street, before turning east into Queens via Northern Boulevard to Jackson Heights. It {{was to have}} been built as a two-track and four-track line, and it would have cost $89,000,000. The second phase <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the line as a two-track line along Corona Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard from Jackson Heights to Marathon Parkway. A storage yard would be built. This phase would have cost $51,820,000. A {{connection}} between the new line and the Crosstown Line {{was to have been}} built at 23rd Street (Ely Avenue) for $10,950,000.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E

50|$|On May 26, 2015, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} that service <b>would</b> be <b>extended</b> to Confederation GO Station in Stoney Creek. Construction {{is expected to}} begin in 2017, with the extension completed in 2019. In June 2016, Ontario Minister of Transportation Steven Del Duca announced the line <b>would</b> be <b>extended</b> to Grimsby, with the Grimsby GO Station expected to open in 2021.|$|R
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Discussion of damming the White River for {{flood control}} {{began in the}} 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held {{hearings}} on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50miles (80km) long, and one arm <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37. The department conducted planning studies on two proposed freeway alignments that <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> Route 37 into Downtown Warwick. The first proposal continued the freeway southeast from US 1 to Airport Road for , while the second proposal extended the freeway east for , intersecting Route 117 and Route 117A {{in the village of}} Hoxsie before terminating at Route 117 (West Shore Road). The first option was ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing would interfere with aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension to Route 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|In late June 2012, {{the group}} {{suffered}} a major computer malfunction, resulting in some customers' account balances not updating correctly. Completions of some new home purchases were delayed, customers were stranded abroad, another was threatened with the discontinuation {{of her life}} support machine in a Mexican hospital, and one man was held in prison. As {{a result of the}} error, RBS and NatWest announced that over 1,200 of their busiest branches <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> their hours throughout the week, including the bank's first Sunday opening, to enable the customers affected to access cash. On 25 June, over 1,000 branches opened for extended hours, and the number of phone staff was doubled.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 state budget, the {{government}} announced that it <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the tram line further. The first extension, completed in early 2010, was from the existing North Terrace terminus to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh, with a park and ride service set up on Port Road. Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines, new tram-trains were proposed to run to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018. However, these plans were later scrapped in the 2012 state budget.|$|E
25|$|The Rogers Junction {{would be}} reconstructed, with {{at-grade}} junctions eliminated, to make capacity for the {{extensions of the}} IRT Eastern Parkway Line's two branches. The IRT Nostrand Avenue Line <b>would</b> be <b>extended</b> along either Flatbush Avenue to Avenue U/Kings Plaza or along Nostrand Avenue to Voorhies Avenue. The IRT New Lots Line <b>would</b> be <b>extended</b> southerly to Flatlands Avenue; the line would run at ground level.|$|R

5|$|On June 9, 2010, the MTO {{approved}} the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa, announcing plans to phase {{construction of the}} extension. Local residents and politicians rejected the plan, as had happened with the section between McCowan Road and Markham Road. A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project, but failed to pass. Instead, a compromise was issued on March 10, 2011: the first phase <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> Highway407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015, including Highway412; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway35/ 115 by 2020, including Highway418.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as Candida Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years. The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp furnishings and paid for transportation to the camps. The responsibilities of the churches included day-to-day management of the camps, subsistence costs, meals and healthcare for the men. When the young men arrived at the first camps, they started a six-month experiment that <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> to six years.|$|E

5|$|The freeway {{was first}} built in Indiana in the 1960s, {{although}} plans in Michigan {{date back to}} the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1998, while Michigan has opened its last segment in 2003. Further plans, if completed, <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the freeway from the current end to the north. The ultimate end will either be at the interchange between Interstate 196 (I-196) and I-94 as originally planned, or another interchange immediately to the southwest. Environmental and other issues have forced a re-evaluation of the original 1981 plans for the northern end of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|Transportation {{within the}} city, {{as well as}} the rest of Hampton Roads is served by a {{regional}} bus service, Hampton Roads Transit. An extension of The Tide light rail system from Norfolk to the oceanfront is currently being studied. For years, Virginia Beach residents have debated on whether or not to extend The Tide from Norfolk into its borders with the apparent divide falling between younger and older residents and the potential cost to Virginia Beach taxpayers. In November 2016, residents voted on a referendum proposing that <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> the light rail from Norfolk to Virginia Beach with 57% against the rail extension and 43% for the extension.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, <b>would</b> <b>extend</b> an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and Ball State of the Mid-American Conference. However, Ball State rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E
