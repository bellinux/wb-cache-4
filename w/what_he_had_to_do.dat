25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{gameplay}} {{being created}} first, Mitsuda had difficulty pinning down <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and wrote songs for the soundtrack {{based on the}} gradually-emerging visuals and scenario. Mitsuda estimated that he had written around one hundred songs for the game including test tracks. The opening vocal track, titled [...] "Ring", was written for the opening movie and set {{to a piece of}} poetry written by Takahashi: to portray the themes of the game, Mitsuda used three female vocalists, Eri Kawai, Koko Komine, and Tamie Hirose, and recorded in a multiplexer to produce as clear a sound as possible. Kawai also performed vocal work for the track [...] "Destruction". For each of the location themes, Mitsuda used a different primary instrument to create an impression: for instance, for a desert location, he used a sitar, while a location dominated by machinery used electric guitar. All the instrument sounds were created using a synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|... "They {{thought he}} didn't have the {{breeding}} to go {{a mile and}} a quarter," [...] said Croll. [...] "They said he couldn't go around two turns. They thought he could win only on the lead. They had a rabbit up front and a closing horse chasing him at the end of {{a mile and a}} quarter. Well, he did <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He answered all the questions." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 2009, {{in one of}} {{his last}} games in the NHL, after scoring the game-winning goal in the 2009 playoffs against the New York Rangers in a 2â€“1 Game 7 contest, then-Capitals Head Coach Bruce Boudreau stated in a press conference, [...] "Let's face it, {{sometimes}} experience pays off. He knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> when to do it, and that's what makes him one of the greatest players, ever." [...] Teammate Alexander Ovechkin added, [...] "He's our leader... He's our best guy in the locker room. He showed it. He's our best guy. He has more experience than anybody in this locker room. He knows how to play like that. He just shows his leadership." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after his}} death, his grave became a shrine. One teenaged girl in North Belfast {{set up a}} shrine to Wright in her bedroom {{complete}} with his photographs. She explained to a journalist, [...] "I'm not interested in pop stars. Billy was a real Loyalist hero and I {{like to go to}} sleep at night looking at him". Gunmen at a paramilitary display in Portadown in 2000 told journalists: [...] "He [...] did <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to ensure that our faith and culture were kept intact." [...] Wright was also taken up as an inspiration by Johnny Adair and the UDA West Belfast Brigade. In the immediate aftermath of Wright's killing Adair told his main gunmen Stephen McKeag and Gary Smyth that they had a free hand to [...] "avenge" [...] Wright's death, with McKeag almost immediately launching a machine gun attack on a bar in a mainly Catholic area despite the UDA being officially on ceasefire. The West Belfast Brigade would later reference Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF in a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF. Despite this the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie [...] "Legs" [...] Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a [...] "bastard" [...] when the UVF leader attended a party at Robinson's house. Robinson wrote the incident off as jealousy on Adair's part as Wright was already well established as a leading figure in loyalism by that stage whilst Adair was still making his name.|$|E

60|$|My aunt made no answer. For the moment, the lawyer's {{objections}} {{seemed to}} annoy her. She addressed herself to Mr. Hartrey; asking rather abruptly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say to her.|$|R

60|$|He {{asked who}} Ishmael was and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her. Rachel told him briefly, {{and though she}} {{suppressed}} much, he looked very grave at that story.|$|E
6000|$|Langbourne did {{not suffer}} the silence which {{followed}} her going to possess him. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> he must do quickly, and he said, [...] "Miss Simpson, may I ask you one question?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's a' right!" [...] {{cried the}} people round. [...] "He's a rare brave lad. Good lad! Good lad!" [...] Barton poured some brandy into his mouth.

6000|$|... "So I {{gave him}} notice," [...] said Mrs. Blinder. [...] "But really {{when the time}} came, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts.

60|$|Then he {{perceived}} {{as though it}} was altogether self-evident <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This was what he wanted. This was the note he had to strike.

60|$|Obedient to the {{indication}} of Mr Clark's hand, the boy approached towards Florence, wondering, as well he might, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her.
