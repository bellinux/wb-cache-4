5|$|Demi Moore had {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz's photograph, More Demi Moore. As a groundbreaking work, the photograph of her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore, Leibovitz and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> who now view public representation of pregnancy as socially acceptable. It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to pose for photographs in advanced pregnancy, which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis. The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it {{as one of the best}} U.S. magazine covers ever, and it is one of Leibovitz' best-known works. Additionally, the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met with laughter, which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E

25|$|Speidel {{wrote in}} his last book that {{traditional}} forms of documentation consistently underrate the contribution of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general,</b> and particularly of less respectable women such as Graham.

25|$|The American {{entry into}} World War I came in April 1917, {{after more than}} {{two and a half years}} of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion {{reflected}} that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans, as well as among church leaders and among <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe. Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.|$|E

Other tribes, often tributaries, are listed, described, and their warriors numbered; Jewitt's transliteration does not always match modern renderings of the names. Jewitt mentions the class structure and says that women were excluded from most feasting. <b>Women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> were very modest, but female slaves were used for sex. Jewitt describes their methods of fishing, trapping bears, and trading (including slave trading). He writes about their weapons, and how they made and managed their huge canoes. Jewitt introduced a new sort of harpoon, enabling more successful whale hunts, and various other weapons and implements that Maquinna reserved to himself as king.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} show's debut, the main characters, {{especially}} the title character, have quickly become the latest fixtures in the lexicon of pop media culture, and already they {{found their way}} onto parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations. The show's impact on issues and culture has also {{attracted the attention of}} the United States Congress, where on January 17, 2007 California congresswoman Hilda Solis (D-32nd, El Monte) saluted Ferrera on both her Golden Globe win and for bringing a positive profile to the Latin and Hispanic communities. In addition to that recognition, on May 8, 2007, star America Ferrera was honored by TIME on the magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people. The event took place at New York's Lincoln Center and the actress was recognized for defying stereotypes with the show. The success of Ugly Betty and how it deals with body imaging among <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> would inspire a series of reports on Entertainment Tonight, in which reporter Vanessa Minnillo went undercover in a fatsuit to see if women were discriminated on the basis of how they look. Gay awareness groups like GLAAD have also noted the positive impact the show has had regarding Betty's teenaged nephew Justin, who realizes that he is gay.|$|E
25|$|In Merriman's hands, the {{convention}} {{is made to}} take an unusual twist. The woman drags the poet {{to the court of}} the fairy queen Aoibheal. There follows a court case in which a young woman calls on Aoibheal to take action against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She is answered by an old man who first laments the infidelity of his own young wife and the dissolute lifestyles of young <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> He then calls on the queen to end the institution of marriage completely and to replace it with a system of free love. The young woman returns to mock the old man's inability to satisfy his young wife's needs and to call {{for an end to the}} celibacy among the clergy so as to widen the pool of prospective mates. Finally, Aoibheal rules that all men must mate by the age of 21, that older men who fail to satisfy women must be punished, that sex must be applauded, not condemned, and that priests will soon be free to marry. To his dismay, the poet discovers that he is to be the first to suffer the consequences of this new law, but then awakens to find it was just a nightmare. In its frank treatment of sexuality and of clerical celibacy, Cúirt An Mheán Oíche is a unique document in the history of Irish poetry in either language.|$|E

However, unlike Sidharta she considers this message directed not only at the children of njais, but <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> Only through receiving an education and following Chinese and European etiquette, she writes, could a woman be considered truly [...] "modern".|$|E
500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape.

[...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general</b> in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the poem {{consists}} of a complaint about the evils of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>general.</b> [...] The poem ends with a mythical example illustrating this point, after which the poem breaks off. [...] It is not certain whether the poem originally ended here: Lloyd-Jones thinks that the ending as it stands is too abrupt, and suggests {{that there may have been}} a number of other mythical examples following the one which is preserved; Leslie Schear disagrees, arguing that it is difficult to think of a mythical example from Greek mythology of a wife's treachery which can top that of Helen of Troy. [...] The fact that this general condemnation of women follows so closely on from the praise of the bee-woman at the end of the first part of the poem is perhaps intended to suggest that though such a woman would be the ideal wife, she is a mirage; no real wives live up to the ideal bee-woman.|$|E
