5|$|When the Southern states seceded {{from the}} Union and the American Civil War began, {{thousands}} of men in Ohio volunteered for service. Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne, who enlisted as privates in the newly formed Poland Guards in June 1861. The men left for Columbus where they were consolidated with other small units to form the 23rd Ohio Infantry. The men were unhappy to learn that, unlike Ohio's earlier volunteer regiments, {{they would not be}} permitted to elect their officers; they would be designated by Ohio's governor, William Dennison. Dennison appointed Colonel William Rosecrans as the commander of the regiment, and the men began training on the outskirts of Columbus. McKinley quickly took to the soldier's life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause. Delays in issuance of uniforms and weapons again brought the men into conflict with their officers, but Major Rutherford B. Hayes convinced them to accept <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had issued them; his style in dealing with the men impressed McKinley, beginning an association and friendship that would last until Hayes' death in 1893.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the {{government}} of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection (ECGC), a domestic company was also awarded with contracts. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when {{the government}} agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx {{for the treatment of}} one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had previously paid before for its municipal waste management.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher {{argued that}} the PC party did not run on {{creating}} a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation {{at the cost of}} billions of dollars, with no where to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the demand side management of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine with the facts that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro fiscal position to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro {{has no choice but to}} raise rates. This in itself will reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.|$|E

25|$|Goldstein's book {{explains}} {{that the purpose of}} the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with rocket bombs, helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).|$|E

Others stayed in what had become the Soviet Union and more went to Poland after 1956. Additional settlement with people from central parts of Poland brought the number of Poles in <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> called the Recovered Territories up to 5 million by 1950. The former German population of 10 million had fled or was expelled to post-war Germany by 1950, of which 5 million were involved in involuntary transfers in the [...] "Polish part of the operation".

500|$|Below {{the king}} were {{a small number}} of dukes (usually descended from very close {{relatives}} of the king) and earls, who formed the senior nobility. Under them were the barons, who in this period were beginning to merge with the local tenants-in-chief to become lairds a group roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Below the lairds were a variety of groups, often ill-defined. These included yeomen, sometimes called [...] "bonnet lairds", often owning substantial land. The practice of fueing (by which a tenant paid an entry sum and an annual feu duty, but could pass the land on to their heirs) meant that the number of people holding heritable possession of lands, which had previously been controlled by the church or nobility expanded.

Below the substantial landholders were the husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants, who were often described as cottars and grassmen, that made up the majority of the working population. Serfdom had died out in Scotland in the fourteenth century, but was virtually restored by statute law for miners and saltworkers. Through the system of courts baron and kirk sessions, landlords still exerted considerable control over their tenants. Society in the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of the}} council. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. At the bottom of society were the masterless men, the unemployed and vagrants, whose numbers were swelled in times of economic downturn or hardship.|$|E
500|$|Opposition to the {{government}} {{came to a head}} March 2 when Conservative leader Bennett first spoke. [...] Bennett was renowned as one of the province's finest orators, and his five-hour speech earned plaudits even from the Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, which praised its [...] "splendor in diction [...] the physical endurance of the orator" [...] and called it a [...] "high water mark for parliamentary debate in Alberta". [...] Bennett lashed out at {{the government}}'s handling of the A file, accusing it of culpable negligence in failing to properly oversee the company's activities. [...] He claimed to have been approached directly by [...] "great financial interests" [...] intent on preventing his participation in the debate. [...] He argued that the discrepancy in the sale price of the bonds and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> had received for them meant that Clarke and his associates had realized a profit of between $200,000 and $300,000 at the government's expense. [...] He closed with an accusation that Cross had sent an emissary to a telephone company that wanted to install an automatic telephone system in Calgary agreeing to reverse his opposition to the deal in exchange for a $12,000 contribution to Cross's campaign fund. [...] These charges, corroborated by Cushing but hotly denied by Cross, were not related to the A affair, but were designed to damage the credibility of the government's de facto house leader {{on the eve of the}} vote on the Woolf-McDougall amendment. [...] The government side adopted similar tactics: Agriculture Minister Duncan Marshall accused Boyle of being motivated by bitterness over having been denied the solicitorship of the A Boyle admitted that he had applied for this position, but denied an accusation from Peace River MLA James Cornwall that he had requested Cornwall's assistance in lobbying for it.|$|E
500|$|Search {{and rescue}} teams {{operated}} across eastern Mexico, and initially they worked amid rainfall. The continuing rains {{and cut off}} communications disrupted relief efforts, as did the topography of the affected areas. In Puebla, the federal government donated 219mules and 81horses to assist in traveling to isolated areas. People used shovels and bare hands to remove mud and concrete in areas where they could not utilize machines. In Tulancingo, Hidalgo, people used rowboats to rescue stranded residents trapped by the flooding. Search and rescue missions ended on October15, after 7,112people were rescued from <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> described as [...] "high-risk situations." [...] To control the flooding, workers released water from dams and reservoirs. In Hidalgo, released water from a dam flooded two rivers and forced thousands of additional evacuations. In Tenango in Puebla, a dam developed a foot-long crack, which sparked evacuations and prompted workers to fill it with dirt and rocks. Stagnant waters raised fears for an outbreak of dengue fever; however, no flood-related epidemics occurred, and the waters were disinfected to prevent disease spread. By October22, there were only 21cases of dengue and 4cases of malaria, both fewer than normal. On October23, the Peñitas Dam was opened to maintain its integrity, causing downstream flooding. It was closed after water flow rates decreased. After the floods, some areas in Mexico faced water shortages. As a result, the National Water Commission initially distributed about 300,000litres of drinking water each day, and later increased it to 487,000litres per day, reaching 4million litres of distributed water by October19. Water service was gradually repaired, and by October19, 70 of the 90damaged water systems in Veracruz were restored. Equipment used for flood efforts were removed from duty after the floods receded.|$|E

500|$|While barons held {{increasingly}} nominal feudal tenures local tenants-in-chief, {{who held}} legally held their land {{directly from the}} king and who by the sixteenth century were often the major local landholders in an area, grew in significance.

Below the substantial landholders were those engaged in subsistence agriculture, who made up the majority of the working population. Those with property rights included husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants. By the early modern era in Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, left home to become domestic and agricultural servants. Women acted as {{an important part of the}} workforce.
