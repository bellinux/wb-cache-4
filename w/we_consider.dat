25|$|This {{generalized}} reflection law is very natural. First, {{it reflects}} an obvious {{fact that the}} walls of the vessel with gas are motionless.

When analyzing human activity, <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> the amount of residential housing that fronted the beach as a static site variable. When analyzing factors affecting wrack, <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> the proportion of a transect likely to be groomed during a month of sampling (unfortunately, there was not sufficient information to accurately match grooming with particular surveys, given that Silver Strand weekly grooming did not focus on wrack, we discounted the grooming effort here to once a month).|$|R

Thus, for the candidate Donald Trump, <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> the words: “@realDonaldTrump”,“Trump” and “DT”. For the candidate Hillary Clinton, <b>we</b> <b>considered</b> the words: “@HillaryClinton”, “Hillary”,“HC”.

With this Chromosome representation, {{the goal of the}} GA is to find the Chromosome that maximizes a fitness function. We only worked with combinations within the proposed range.
