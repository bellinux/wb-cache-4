60|$|Then {{the good}} Dame Charter, being greatly {{recovered}} and so happy, {{began to talk}} of herself. Slipping in a disjointed way over her various experiences, she told her dear boy, in strictest confidence, {{that she was very}} much disappointed in the way pirates took ships. She {{thought it was going to}} be something very exciting that she would remember to the end of her days, and wake up in the middle of the night and scream when she thought of it, but it was nothing of the kind; not a shot was fired, not a drop of blood shed; there was not even a shout or a yell or a scream for mercy. It was all like going into the pantry to get the flour and the sugar. She was all the time waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever did. Dickory smiled, but it was like <b>watered</b> <b>milk.</b>|$|E

[...] The chiefs begin early morning by going their rounds for drink, and end business between 7 and 10 A.M. Everywhere on this coast a few hours of work support a [...] "gentleman;" [...] even the comparatively industrious and hard-working Egbas rarely do anything after noon. These lords and masters are fully aware that the white men are their willing slaves as long as the large profits last. If a glass of watered rum, which they detect more easily than we do <b>watered</b> <b>milk,</b> be offered to them, it will be thrown in the donor's face. Every factory must keep a barrel of spirits ready broached if the agents would buy eggs and yams, and the poorest negro comes regularly with his garrafa. The mixed stuff costs per bottle only a hundred reis (= fourpence), and thoroughly demoralizes the black world.|$|E

This network and other Sicilian {{suppliers}} dominated heroin trafficking since the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when US and Italian law enforcement were able to significantly reduce the heroin supply of the Sicilian Mafia (the so-called Pizza Connection). The Bontade-Spatola-Inzerillo traffickers supplied the Gambino Family - through John Gambino - in New York with heroin that was refined in laboratories on the island from Turkish morphine base. According to Giovanni Falcone, the investigating magistrate, the group had made about US$600 million. The proceeds were re-invested in real estate.

40|$|Early in the 20 th century, {{when food}} safety {{was a major}} concern to the public, two technologies, milk {{pasteurization}} and retort canning, were developed, promoted, and virtually canonized as prevention measures against foodborne diseases.

Nonetheless, {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century, foodborne disease remains a major threat to public health, as new pathogens and products have emerged (1). Many of these threats can be controlled by applying new technologies, when we as a society are willing to use them.

30|$|Goat milk is a {{commodity}} that generates a regular income flow for households; however, the milk trade is disadvantageous for farmers. A similar disadvantageous dairy marketing {{has been described}} in northern {{parts of the country}} (Gómez-Ruiz et al. [2012]). There was a huge contrast between the farmers’ uneasy economic situation and the prosperous cajeta industry. Coronado is a subsidiary of Bimbo, worldwide the fourth largest food company and the largest bread manufacturer (Ochoa [2013]). Bimbo reported 20 % larger profits in 2005 than in 2004.a Farmers were paid about 13 % of the shelf price.b The caramel industry is the main winner here and as such it can be called a ‘food empire’ (Ploeg [2010]), which sets its rules such as milk price and the quality standards, e.g. checking <b>watered</b> <b>milk,</b> that are important for cajeta production.|$|E

The results obtained by this calculation are compared to the limits fixed for a 99 % confidence interval. The aims of this work were: a) to determine the suitability of this method to <b>water</b> buffalo <b>milk</b> fat b) to propose a modification to the method for evaluation of <b>water</b> buffalo <b>milk</b> fat purity c) to determine the sensibility of the method for the detection of non lactic foreign fats in <b>water</b> buffalo <b>milk</b> 250 samples of <b>water</b> buffalo <b>milk</b> fat were extracted from milk of guaranteed origin.
