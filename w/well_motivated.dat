25|$|Another {{school of}} thought is {{represented}} by Petrukhin and Pushkina who maintain that Smolensk and Gnyozdovo peacefully coexisted throughout the 10th century. According to this version, Gnyozdovo was a pogost of the ruling Kievan monarch which he used to levy tribute from the Krivichs. Since the knyaz's druzhina was composed primarily of the Norsemen, a substantial Varangian presence at Gnyozdovo seems to be <b>well</b> <b>motivated.</b> Concurrently, Smolensk was an urban centre of the Slavic (Krivich) population, where the regional veche was held. After Vladimir the Great established a local principality for his son, the administrative centre {{of the region and}} the seat of princely power was moved from Gnyozdovo to Smyadyn Castle near Smolensk.|$|E

The Hebrew story thus seems inferior compared to the Indian one, and Gunkel concludes that it is secondary and stems from the Indian story.

Despite extensive research, traditional macro models of exchange rate determination [...] {{with the exception of}} the Bank of Canada's exchange rate equation [...] have typically not fared <b>well,</b> <b>motivating</b> economists to explore new ways to model exchange rate movements that incorporate more complex and realistic settings. Within the context of the sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar in 2003 and 2004, Bailliu and King review the macroeconomic models of exchange rates, as well as the micro-structure studies that highlight the importance of trading mechanisms, information asymmetry, and investor heterogeneity for explaining short-term dynamics in exchange rates. In addition to summarizing the current state of knowledge, they highlight recent advances and identify promising alternative approaches. ...|$|R

50|$|Nearly 35,000 strong, <b>well</b> <b>motivated</b> and supremely confident, the Zulu were a {{formidable}} force {{on their own}} home ground, despite the almost total lack of modern weaponry. Their greatest assets were their morale, unit leadership, mobility and numbers. Tactically the Zulu acquitted themselves well in at least 3 encounters, Isandhlwana, Hlobane and the smaller Intombi action. Their stealthy approach march, camouflage and noise discipline at Isandhlwana, while not perfect, put them within excellent striking distance of their opponents, where {{they were able to}} exploit weaknesses in the camp layout. At Hlobane they caught a British column on the move rather than in the usual fortified position, partially cutting off its retreat and forcing it to withdraw.|$|E
