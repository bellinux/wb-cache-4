5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{was in the}} field of general relativity. In particular, he made contributions to cosmology, the theory of gravitational lenses and gravitational <b>waves.</b> <b>His</b> principal concern was to clarify general relativity's mathematical structure and its consequences, separating rigorous proofs from heuristic conjectures.|$|E
5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E

25|$|Many {{advances}} in photographic glass plates and printing were {{made during the}} rest of the 19th century. In 1891, Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light <b>waves.</b> <b>His</b> scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.|$|E
25|$|A simple device theorised {{to detect}} the {{expected}} wave motion is called a Weber bar — a large, solid bar of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the bar's resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might {{be strong enough to}} be seen without resonant amplification. With this instrument, Joseph Weber claimed to have detected daily signals of gravitational <b>waves.</b> <b>His</b> results, however, were contested in 1974 by physicists Richard Garwin and David Douglass. Modern forms of the Weber bar are still operated, cryogenically cooled, with superconducting quantum interference devices to detect vibration. Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{his agent}} Jeff Andrews, during the airing of Whose Line Mochrie was better known in Canada as a [...] "commercial king", {{performing}} as characters such the Detergent Crusader for Sunlight detergent.

2500|$|This may {{refer to}} {{the origins of the}} worship of Ingui in the tribal areas that Tacitus {{mentions}} in his Germania as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes. A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from. The strophe also states that [...] "then he (Ingui) went back over the <b>waves,</b> <b>his</b> wagon behind him" [...] which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of Nerthus and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr's wagon journeys.|$|E
2500|$|This was the {{opposite}} of what happened to the English leg-spinner Doug Wright, a notorious no-baller with a [...] "long, springy run and windmill action" [...] that saw him overstep the line too many times. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "He <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps." [...] Jack Fingleton called the no-ball [...] "Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history", It was easier for the umpires to call Wright for no-balling as be bowled at a slow-medium pace and Lindwall’s fast bowling was more difficult to judge, but they should have called them equally if their feet were over the line. Incidentally, Wright had a habit of licking his hand before bowling each ball which the umpires forbade in the 1950-51 Ashes series and upset his rhythm, but was allowed by Scott and Bowick in 1946-47.|$|E

2500|$|Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but had trouble with his no balls due to his odd run up [...] "He <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship {{pitching}} and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps." [...] Jack Fingleton called the no-ball [...] "Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history", [...] "On at least four occasions he was convinced he had Bradman in his bag but it was not to be. Wright, I believe was very keen to secure such a verdict over Bradman, who only once has been dismissed l.b.w. during his Anglo-Australian Test career". In the end he was overbowled and expensive. Of particular note is that Wright was the biggest wicket-taker on either side with 23 wickets - five more than any other bowler - but with the high average of 43.04. He was also the chief first–class wicket-taker of the 1946–47 season – 51 wickets (33.31) - and bowled just over a third of England’s overs in the Tests; 246.3 compared to 240.2 by Alec Bedser and 246.5 by the rest.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} raw muscle power needed for tug of war, {{it is also}} a {{technical}} sport. The cooperation or [...] "rhythm" [...] of team members play an equally important role in victory, if not more, than their physical strength. To achieve this, a person called a [...] "driver" [...] is used to harmonize the team's joint traction power. He moves up and down next to his team pulling on the rope, giving orders to them when to pull and when to rest (called [...] "hanging"). If he spots the opponents trying to pull his team away, he gives a [...] "hang" [...] command, each member will dig into the grass with his/her boots and movement of the rope is limited. When the opponents are played out, he shouts [...] "pull" [...] and rhythmically <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> hat or handkerchief for his team to pull together. Slowly but surely, the other team is forced into surrender by a runaway pull. Another factor that affects the game that is little known are the players' weights. The heavier someone is, the more static friction their feet have to the ground, and if there isn't enough friction and they weigh too little, even if he/she is pulling extremely hard, the force won't go into the rope. Their feet will simply slide along the ground if their opponent(s) have better static friction with the ground. In general, as long as one team has enough static friction and can pull hard enough to overcome the static friction of their opponent(s), that team can easily win the match.|$|E
2500|$|Australia had 30 {{minutes to}} bat until stumps, but Merv Harvey was out for 12 runs off 15 balls and Bradman {{came to the}} wicket. In the Second Test at Sydney Alec Bedser had caught Sid Barnes with an in-swinging leg-break and had {{developed}} this delivery, soon known as Bedser's “Special Ball” and clean-bowled Bradman for a duck. Bradman wrote [...] "The ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only {{to turn off the}} pitch and hit the middle and off stumps". He returned to the Australian dressing room telling the waiting batsmen that it had been an unplayable ball. Keith Miller thought he was making excuses for being out for a duck and that [...] "He did no service to those who still had to face Alec", but Bradman maintained that it had been good enough to bowl him if he had been on 300. Australia began the third day on 24/2, but soon made a complete recovery from their bad start. Doug Wright (3/152) had trouble with his no balls due to his odd run up [...] "He <b>waves</b> <b>his</b> arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps." [...] As a result, Bedser (3/97) was called on to bowl virtually all day until he could barely stand from heat exhaustion. Bill Edrich (0/88) had opened the bowling, but could make no impression on the dull pitch and Norman Yardley (3/101) was called upon to bowl 31 overs. Morris made 122 with 12 fours and 2 sixes, adding 189 with Lindsay Hassett (78). Keith Miller hit his maiden Test century; 141 not out in [...] hours with 9 fours and a six, adding 150 with Ian Johnson (52), 27 with Lindwall (20) and 63 with Dooland (29). Toshack was brilliantly run out by Edrich for a duck and Australia were out for 487, a lead of 27 on the first innings.|$|E
