5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912–13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the club.|$|E
5|$|Jared's silence {{leads to}} the {{breakdown}} of his relationships with both Rachel and his mother Diane. In the plays last scene Jared confesses to Diane that he witnessed the three youths raping Tracy, {{though he did not}} intervene. He is unsure <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> nothing though he believes it was out of loyalty to the boys who were his mates. Ricko left Jared a suicide note giving him his van, though Jared asks Cherie to dump the keys to the van in the ocean when she goes out surfing.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

60|$|March 14.--She {{continually}} wonders <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not come, {{the five}} months of his enforced absence having expired; and still more she wonders <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not write oftener. His last letter was cold, she says, and she fears he regrets his marriage, which he may only have celebrated with her for pity's sake, thinking she was sure to die. It makes one's heart bleed to hear her hovering thus so near the truth, and yet never discerning its actual shape.|$|R
5|$|Tom later {{searches}} Black's office, stealing his gun {{and finding}} Green's name and address. Tom confronts Green at his home, demanding to know where his wife is. The police, who have been watching Green's house, intervene and take Tom home before anyone is harmed. Black apologizes for keeping information from Tom, but warns him that his outburst is exactly <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so. Watts has meanwhile tracked forensic evidence from the abandoned car to a cabin in the woods; blood found there matches both Green and Helen, and a ring is discovered which is identified as Helen's wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|During Godwin's exile, Robert {{is said to}} {{have been}} sent by the king on an errand to William, Duke of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin's son Wulfnoth and {{grandson}} Hakon (son of Sweyn). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.|$|E
5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys has been talking about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it.|$|E

5|$|When Raghavan {{is about}} to leave his house for a {{marriage}} proposal, Sundaram comes there and describes the girl {{he was talking about}} to Raghavan. Raghavan realises that Radha, whom he intends to marry, is the same girl Sundaram is in love with. Raghavan, believing that Radha loves Sundaram, decides to help Sundaram attain his love and get a chance to act in films, which he does successfully. Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not show up for the marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E

25|$|Once {{there was}} a {{competition}} between Ganesha and his brother as to see who could circumambulate the three worlds faster and hence win the fruit of knowledge. Skanda went off on a journey to cover the three worlds while Ganesha simply circumambulated his parents. When asked <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so, he answered that his parents Shiva and Parvati constituted the three worlds and was thus given the fruit of knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Humanae vitae (Latin: Of Human Life) is an {{encyclical}} {{written by}} Pope Paul VI and dated 25 July 1968. The text was issued at a Vatican {{press conference on}} 29 July. Subtitled On the Regulation of Birth, it re-affirmed the orthodox teaching of the Catholic Church regarding married love, responsible parenthood, and the rejection of most forms of artificial contraception. In formulating his teaching he explained <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not accept the conclusions of the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control established by his predecessor, Pope John XXIII, a commission he himself had expanded.|$|E
25|$|In 1777, Ambrosio O'Higgins became {{acquainted with}} the {{powerful}} Riquelme family from Chillán, {{and fell in love}} with the daughter, Isabel Riquelme, almost forty years his junior (she was 18 or 19 at the time, while he was 57 years old). He promised marriage, but colonial law forbade marriage between public officials and criolla women without authorization of the crown. To disregard this law was to risk career and position. It is not known <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not seek permission, but no marriage ensued even when Isabel became pregnant.|$|E

25|$|However, {{later that}} year at Watkins Glen when Ambrose was leading the NBNS race, in the final five laps he took the lead and with 2 laps left he raced behind the bumper of a lapped Boris Said. Ambrose's crew chief Gary Cogswell ordered Ambrose to not pass Said believing that Said still had a grudge against them after Mexico City. The fans, Ambrose, his team and among other NASCAR drivers were {{surprised}} when Boris Said did not commit his revenge before Ambrose later won the race. To this day Said has not explained <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not crash Ambrose {{when he had a}} good chance and it still remains unknown why Said did not perform his revenge.|$|E
25|$|While Lytle's brigade {{was being}} beaten back, the left flank of Phil Sheridan's {{division}} {{was only a}} few hundred yards to the south on Peters Hill. One of the lingering controversies of the battle has been <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not choose to join the fight. Earlier in the day he had been ordered by Gilbert not to bring on a general engagement. At around 2 p.m., the sound of artillery fire reached army headquarters where Buell was having dinner with Gilbert; the two generals assumed that it was Union artillery practicing and sent word to Sheridan not to waste gunpowder. Sheridan did project some artillery fire into the Confederate assault, but when Gilbert finally arrived from the rear, he feared that Sheridan would be attacked and ordered him back to his entrenchments.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of the {{following}} year, heavy flooding occurred in many commanderies, with Yan Province being the worst hit. Xun Xu wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu and suggested that he create {{the office of a}} dushui shizhe (都水使者; an official in charge of waterworks) to deal with floods in the future. Later, on a separate occasion, he appointed his subordinates Yin Xian (伊羨) and Zhao Xian (趙咸) as Members of the Retinue (舍人) and tasked them with drafting legislation. When Emperor Wu asked him <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so, Xun Xu explained the importance of delegating responsibilities to subordinates. He also pointed out why he believed it was redundant to have officials focusing on drafting legislation only since their duties overlap with those of other officials, so it was better to delegate such additional responsibilities to the latter group.|$|E

After Lily engages in illegal intercourse with him, Colleen tells Lily's parents, Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Drucilla (Victoria Rowell). They have him arrested. In retaliation, Kevin attempts to murder Colleen by locking {{her in a}} freezer inside a burning building. J.T. rescues her and carries {{her out of the}} building. The couple moves on from the Kevin ordeal as J.T. begins to focus on his music career. This serves as a roadblock in their romance as Colleen becomes jealous of J.T.'s closeness with other girls in his music video. During a press conference, he also lies to a reporter about not having a girlfriend. Though he attempts to explain <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that, Colleen decides to move back to New York to live with her mother so she will not be {{standing in the way of}} J.T.'s career.
