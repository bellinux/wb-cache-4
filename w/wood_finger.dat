There is a public house: the Black Horse; a butterfly centre; and camp sites at Densole. Also nearby is Reinden Woods, {{which is part of}} the East Kent Dry Training Area.The East Kent Dry Training Area is rural in character and is used extensively by the military for tactical training exercises. Situated within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Reinden Wood is an important habitat for woodland plants and butterflies.Walk descriptionThis walk was developed in conjunction with White Cliffs Countryside Project. Follow the Reinden <b>Wood</b> <b>finger</b> posts along the route. From the car park A (GR 213 409), follow the bridleway northwards to the edge of the wood B (GR 214 413). On meeting a gravelly/semi metalled track, turn left and continue to follow the edge of the woodland. After about 1 km, C (GR 219 421) follow the path, right back into the wood, down a narrow track. At D (GR 222 420) take the left fork and follow the path southwestwards. When you reach the edge of the wood, follow the waymarkers, directing you back to the carpark A (GR 213 409).|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the flexural properties of rectangular Burma teak wood beam without finger joint and with finger joint. Finger joints enable full utilization of <b>wood.</b> <b>Finger</b> jointing technique {{is also used}} to eliminate wood defects which weaken the strength of wood. This paper considers finger joint as defined defect and its effect on the flexural strength is determined. Teakwood is hard and heavy, seasons rapidly and has good durability. The specimens were studied under three point bending test. Both edge wise and flat wise tests were carried out. It is observed that Burma teakwood beam without finger joint is stronger than beams with finger joints. Because of finger jointing the flexural strength reduces. It can be concluded that the strength loss can improved upon by selecting suitable geometry of finger joint and a suitable adhesive. It is recognized that further studies are necessary on jointing techniques of wood and type of adhesive so as to equal the flexural strength properties of clear teak wood beams...|$|E

All of the crowd assembled at the graveyard saw it. When alive, these men had committed all kinds of mischief, including rape, theft and murder; when their corps was abolished, they had not been delivered to the executioner, interestingly, as evidenced by their age they had died a natural death.

60|$|It is {{with extreme}} {{reluctance}} that I dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no after events {{have been able}} to efface in the slightest degree from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every future moment of my existence. Let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of will permit. The only method we could devise for the terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the holder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots. There are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths--a death for the most appalling of purposes--every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror. I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of <b>wood,</b> my <b>fingers</b> absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions, and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of rendering the decision by lot useless--in short, of every thing but of going through with the matter I had in hand. At last, after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring. Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for this apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that glued {{laminated}} timber features dispensed natural defects and enhance dimensional stability, strength, and uniform quality. The manufacturing techniques can be applied in designing projects for large spaces, long spans, and curved structures [4]. It solves the limitation of the structure size and becomes an important building structural member for modern wood-based architecture. This inspires an alternative approach considering disassembling the bamboo culm into thin flat laminae and then laminating them together with adhesive to form a designated structural member with better rigidity and higher loading capacity. In that case, {{one of the advantages of}} laminated products for bamboo is that the member length can be extended to any desired size by joining the structural elements end to end with an effective joint. Liu and Lii [5] examined the joint performance of solid wood assembled with various adhesives. They indicated that the scarf joint was 20 – 47 % lower in strength than that of finger joint, and the butt joint showed poor strength, being 70 % lower than the finger joint. The finger joint method could be the most extensive approach for glulam manufacturing and might be applied to the laminating bamboo process. The structural performance of a finger joint for the different wood species has been verified to be influenced by the ratio of finger spacing to finger length and the ratio of the width of the finger tip to finger spacing [6, 7]. On the other hand, the wall of bamboo culm contains a high percentage of parenchyma cells and uneven vascular distribution, affecting the mechanical properties for each bamboo species [8, 9]. These might show the different joint characteristics from solid <b>wood</b> during the <b>finger</b> joint assembly in advance. Liu et al. [10] indicated that the gluing strength and bamboo failure percentage vary for the strips glued together with the surfaces having different vascular configurations. Therefore, by considering the effective culm thickness and diameter, the bamboo member laminated from different culm growth heights of two major species and finger-joined with various finger lengths in addition to the orientation of finger profile is developed in this study to clarify the flexural performance of the laminated bamboo member for potential structural application.|$|R
