40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only <b>with</b> the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> financial crises in 1991 and 2000.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

5|$|Each November, the Andromedids {{meteor shower}} appears to radiate from Andromeda. The shower peaks in mid-to-late November every year, {{but has a}} low peak rate of fewer than two meteors per hour. Astronomers have often {{associated}} the Andromedids with Biela's Comet, which was destroyed in the 19th century, but that connection is disputed. Andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself {{is considered to be}} diffuse, as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from Andromeda itself. Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red fireballs. The Andromedids <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> the most spectacular meteor showers of the 19th century; the storms of 1872 and 1885 were estimated to have a peak rate of two meteors per second (a zenithal hourly rate of 10,000), prompting one Chinese astronomer to compare the meteors to falling rain. The Andromedids had another outburst on December 3–5, 2011, the most active shower since 1885, with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 50 meteors per hour. The 2011 outburst was linked to ejecta from Comet Biela, which passed close to the Sun in 1649. None of the meteoroids observed <b>were</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> material from the comet's 1846 disintegration.
