5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
5|$|Holtz and {{his wife}} Jennifer Fitzgerald, whom he met while he was working at Florida State, have two sons and a daughter. Outside of the {{football}} team, Holtz is deeply involved with an annual spring golf tournament named the Drew Steele-Skip Holtz Golf Classic. Drew Steele {{is the son of}} former East Carolina basketball coach Mike Steele and has Down syndrome. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> Holtz was impressed by Drew's positive attitude, and he has since called upon Drew to help motivate the football team, both as a speaker and through work with the team. The Drew Steele-Skip Holtz Golf Classic benefits citizens of Pitt County with special needs.|$|E

60|$|They sat apart, and not together; each looking afar off at vague objects, {{and not in}} each other's eyes. Thus the sad autumn {{afternoon}} waned, {{while the}} waterfall hissed sarcastically of the inevitableness of the unpleasant. Very different this from the time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> there.|$|R

5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|Her most {{documented}} {{romantic relationship}} was with Kurt Cobain. It is uncertain <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> {{and there are}} varying accounts of how they came to know one another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E
5|$|The {{setback for}} the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased {{with the results}} of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The king asked his {{archbishop}} to write a new preface for the Great Bible, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was {{in the form of a}} sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king. In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League. Henry was dismayed with Anne <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer. However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the king defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.|$|E
50|$|The musical {{chronicles the}} romance between Jamie Wellerstein (Jordan) and Cathy Hiatt (Kendrick). However, {{it does not}} take place in chronological order: all of Cathy's songs begin after they have {{separated}} and move backwards in time to the beginning of their courtship, while Jamie's songs start <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have <b>first</b> <b>met</b> and proceeds through their crumbling marriage.|$|R

60|$|Soft-heartedness was Aline's weakness. She {{had never}} clearly {{recognized}} it, {{but it had}} been partly pity that had induced her to accept Freddie; he had seemed so downtrodden and sorry for himself during those Autumn days <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Prudence warned her that strange things might happen if once she allowed herself to pity George Emerson.|$|R

25|$|Harvey and Kim Novak took {{an almost}} instant dislike {{to each other}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> {{to work on a}} remake of W.

During filming, kidnap threats were made against both Harvey and Novak.|$|E
60|$|She paused, absorbed {{once more}} in her own thoughts. Startled, on the memorable day <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> by Geoffrey's family name, she had put the {{question}} to him whether there had not been some acquaintance between their parents in the past time. Deceiving her in all else, he had not deceived in this. He had spoken in good faith, when he had declared that he had never heard her father or her mother mentioned at home.|$|R

25|$|In {{an episode}} {{broadcast}} on ITV on 4 March 2006, Tony Blair {{became the first}} serving Prime Minister {{to be interviewed by}} Parkinson and volunteered the information that he believed he would be judged by God for the Iraq War.

25|$|Tate and Polanski later {{agreed that}} {{neither of them had}} been {{impressed}} by the other <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Polanski was planning The Fearless Vampire Killers, which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress Jill St. John for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate, and after meeting with her, he agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming.|$|E
25|$|Other {{indication}} of his passionate nature concerns an affair he {{is believed to}} have had with the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly contemptuous of it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests drew her to more mature men, such as Herbert Asquith, particularly if they had a reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend significant private time together on Capri.|$|E
60|$|Now that he {{had made}} up his mind to {{undertake}} the expedition, old Tom Dillon brightened up wonderfully, and to the boys he appeared ten years younger than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> him. He was a fatherly kind of a man, and the more they saw of him the better they liked him. He selected the outfit with care, securing five good horses--one for each of them and an extra animal for the camp stuff, and other things they were to take along.|$|R
5000|$|Klonoa was {{designed}} by Yoshihiko Arai. Arai's first design, [...] "Shady", had a shadow-like appearance. However, {{he felt that the}} lack of color did not seem tasteful, and dropped the design. His next design was created with characteristically animal eyes and long ears, as Arai felt that a person's eyes and silhouette are the features noticed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> He added a large hat with a Pac-Man emblem on it and collar to give the character a childlike and energetic quality. The design was kept and used for Klonoa.|$|R

25|$|The game's soundtrack {{was handled}} by Hiroyuki Sawano. Sawano had earned acclaim {{for his work}} on the soundtracks for {{multiple}} anime series including Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown and Kill la Kill. Takahashi had been a long-time fan of Sawano, so he personally insisted on having Sawano compose for this game. Sawano was more than willing to discuss the project when Takahashi suggested it. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> Takahashi showed Sawano a concept video for the game, which provided the inspiration for Sawano's subsequent work. Sawano created the music based on the musical selections and resources provided by Monolith Soft staff, before working on the music in his own studio.|$|E
25|$|Over {{four years}} later, Light {{is able to}} garner most of the world's support, {{reaching}} the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. But two young men, Mello and Near, both raised as potential successors to L begin to separately investigate the case that took the life of their predecessor. Near heads the SPK (Special Provision for Kira), an American investigation team composed of CIA and FBI agents, while Mello teams up with the Mafia. Although Mello dies working separate from Near, his actions lead Teru Mikami, a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, {{to make a mistake}} that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E

60|$|To Venice {{they had}} been {{accompanied}} by Monsieur Blandois of Paris, and at Venice Monsieur Blandois of Paris {{was very much in}} the society of Gowan. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> this gallant gentleman at Geneva, Gowan had been undecided whether to kick him or encourage him; and had remained for about four-and-twenty hours, so troubled to settle the point to his satisfaction, that he had thought of tossing up a five-franc piece on the terms, 'Tails, kick; heads, encourage,' and abiding by the voice of the oracle. It chanced, however, that his wife expressed a dislike to the engaging Blandois, and that the balance of feeling in the hotel was against him. Upon it, Gowan resolved to encourage him.|$|R
60|$|Brooke fancied {{she meant}} that it was under {{somewhat}} different circumstances, and sat looking {{at her with a}} little smile. She was also, he decided, even better worth inspection than she had been in the bush, for the rich attire became her, and the garish electric radiance emphasized the gleam of the white shoulder the dainty laces clung about and of the ivory neck the moonlight had shone upon <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>they</b> <b>met.</b>|$|R
25|$|Isabella was {{at first}} {{unprepared}} for the lavish style of court life in Burgundy, {{one of the most}} extravagant in Europe. The Portuguese infanta, described by the Burgundian embassy that had negotiated her marriage as appearing to their eyes as a nun <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> and now dressed in loose clothing and flat over-panels to hide her pregnancy, looked particularly dowdy at her new court. More upsetting to Isabella, however, was her husband's behaviour. He had showered gifts on her when she had first arrived, and still more when she had become pregnant; yet, {{he made it clear that}} he had no intention of keeping his vows of fidelity and chastity. He kept numerous women as his lovers, most living away from the court, and as many as 50 illegitimate children.|$|R
500|$|In 1794, George, Prince of Wales, {{sought a}} {{suitable}} bride. [...] He {{did not do}} so out of any particular desire to secure the succession, but because he was promised an increased income if he married. His choice fell on his cousin Caroline of Brunswick, although he had never met her. George and Caroline were repelled by one another <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> but the marriage went ahead on 8 April 1795. George later stated that the couple had sex only three times; they separated within weeks, though they remained under the same roof.|$|E

500|$|On 30 August 1945, Birkett {{received}} a letter from the Lord Chancellor asking him to serve as the British judge at the Nuremberg Trials of German War Criminals. He accepted, saying that it was [...] "a great honour to be selected". But when he went to London to discuss it, he was informed that the Foreign Office wanted a more senior judge to be in attendance, ideally a Law Lord, but since no Law Lord was available, they had requested that a judge from the Court of Appeal should be appointed. Geoffrey Lawrence was made the main British judge, and Birkett was offered the position of alternate judge for the trials, which he accepted, although with less enthusiasm than he had shown when accepting the original offer. He became friends with the American judge Francis Biddle, although <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> he accidentally confused him with Anthony Drexel Biddle and remarked how useful his diplomatic training would be in the trials.|$|E
6000|$|Still strangely {{abstracted}} (but conscious {{now of the}} way {{by which}} he went), Mr. Bashwood left the public-house a few minutes later, in his turn.

However, he is forbidden human contact and has no corporeal body. In order to kill, he uses his slave, Eve, to kill for him. Every time Eve's blood is spilled, Judas comes out and forces Eve to [...] "say his prayers", in other words, kill. However, despite being forced to commit such heinous acts, Eve is also forced to dress like a girl. Judas had mistaken him for girl <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> and he has forced Eve to dress like a girl.

60|$|Seeing his manœuvres, Lydie's every {{suspicion}} was aroused; {{something had}} occurred to disturb her father this morning, something {{which he did not}} intend to tell her. She drew him further back into the window embrasure and made room for him close to her on the settee. She looked up impatiently at the Dowager Lady Eglinton, who had calmly stood her ground whilst the other intimates were being so summarily dismissed. Miladi appeared determined to ignore her daughter-in-law's desire to be alone with her father, and it even seemed to Lydie as if a look of understanding had passed between the Duke and the old lady <b>when</b> <b>first</b> <b>they</b> <b>met.</b>|$|R
