These new malleable wrought iron rails had been the source of a rift between Stephenson and Losh, as Losh had originally expected to supply cast-iron rails from his ironworks, which Stephenson had briefly been a partner in. Stephenson though chose to use an improved iron rail from John Birkinshaw's Bedlington Ironworks instead.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>wheel</b> <b>truing</b> {{stand is}} a {{specialized}} tool for [...] "truing" [...] (straightening) bicycle wheels. Individual models differ slightly, but all consist of an axle stand {{on which the}} wheel can rotate and calipers, to measure slight deviations of the wheel's rim from ideal alignment.

50|$|In 1963, Howard Hawkins and Art Engstrom {{were the}} owners of a bicycle shop in the Twin Cities area. They noticed {{that there were no}} tools {{available}} to repair the increasingly complex bicycles of the 1960s, so they began creating their own tools. The first was a stand that held the bike off the ground allowing convenient access to any part of the bike. Other area bike shops and Schwinn Bicycle Company liked the stands and requested a production model. Soon after, the company expanded to include <b>wheel</b> <b>truing</b> stands, then expanded further into consumer wrenches and gauges. By the early 1980s, Hawkins and Engstrom were a perennial top ten Schwinn dealer with three stores but sold their bicycle shops to focus their efforts on the tool business. Today, both Art Engstrom and Howard Hawkins are retired. Park Tool is owned and operated by Eric Hawkins, Howard Hawkins' son, and now offers more than 300 bicycle repair tools in its line.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, Hawkins {{purchased}} 'Hazel Park Radio and Bicycle' on White Bear Avenue and East 7th Street in Saint Paul, Minnesota's Hazel Park neighborhood {{along with}} his boyhood friend and business partner Art Engstrom. They opened a small bicycle repair shop, repairing and selling Schwinn bicycles. For their convenience, they invented a bike stand that lifted a bike {{off the ground and}} could swivel it around. In 1963, after introducing the stand to the Schwinn Bicycle Company and building them for Schwinn dealerships, they started a bicycle tools business they named Park Tool. They expanded to <b>wheel</b> <b>truing</b> stands, a variety of other tools and eventually tools for average cyclists. In 1967, they moved their store to White Bear Avenue and Highway 36, which grew to become 'Park Schwinn', a national top-10 Schwinn Bicycle Company dealership, eventually with three locations. In 1981, they sold all stores to concentrate on the bicycle tool business they had been running alongside the retail stores. The small tool company grew and became the world's largest supplier of bicycle tools, Park Tool Company, now in Oakdale, Minnesota.|$|E

40|$|The round-off truing {{method of}} a {{grinding}} wheel for precision form grinding, where the circular motion of a CNC grinding machine and an abrasive stick are utilized, was previously {{proposed by the}} authors. In a former study, the compensation method of mal-distribution of wear ratio, α, for an abrasive stick was proposed {{and the use of}} this method resulted in the improvement of truing accuracy.

40|$|In this study, an {{analytical}} and experimental investigation of truing and dressing process of CBN/SG grinding wheels is described. An analytical {{model of the}} interaction between CBN wheel grits and truing diamond grits was developed for rotary disc parallel and perpendicular arrangements of wheel-truer axes. The model takes into account the truing parameters, the geometry and features of the grinding wheel and truing disc, and grit retention capabilities of both these tools. It was found that number of collisions between CBN grits and diamond grits is predominantly dependent on truer specification. From the truing process parameters, when preparing a grinding wheel surface, lead is the most influential, followed by speed ratio and truing depth. ^ Experiments confirmed the importance of the above truing parameters as predicted by the analytical model. The limiting factor governing the frequency of <b>wheel</b> <b>truing</b> {{has been shown to be}} due to loss of profile rather than volumetric wear. In addition, if the truing conditions produce a dull grinding wheel the steady-state level of grinding force will be at a higher level than for optimally trued wheels. ^ A comprehensive cost model of the entire grinding operation, including auxiliary activities, was also developed. It can be used for continuous and batch-type production including reoccurring jobs. The model accounts for different types of superabrasive wheels and conventional abrasive wheels, as well as for continuous dress operation. It takes into account costs of various pieces of the equipment used, performance characteristics of each process involved in the entire grinding operation, and cost of machine time. The model allows for calculation of cost-per-part as well as target costs for all pieces of the equipment. Optimal batch sizes can be calculated for different types of wheels. Simulation results using the cost model in industrial applications are also presented. It has been shown that contrary to widespread beliefs, CBN wheels can be very cost-efficient even when used for production in small batches. In environments characterized by a high labor cost, the time efficiency of truing, dressing and other auxiliary operations is crucial in reduction of total grinding costs. ...|$|E

50|$|A train wheel or {{rail wheel}} {{is a type}} of wheel {{specially}} designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie (UK), also called a truck (North America). Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New <b>wheels</b> are <b>trued,</b> using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to ensure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly <b>trued</b> <b>wheels</b> increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. Monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires, while resilient rail wheels have a resilient material, such as rubber, between the wheel and tire.|$|R

40|$|Some {{unbalance}} either inherent or induced {{is always}} to be expected in automobile wheels. It may be inherent due to imperfect balancing of the wheel {{or it may be}} induced by the uneven wear of the tires. While in motion this unbalance simultaneously sets up two vibrations in the wheel, one a linear vibration normal to the road and the other an angular vibration about the king pin. The frequency of these vibrations depends on the forward speed of the vehicle and when it coincides with the natural frequency of vibration of the wheels the well known phenomenon of resonance occurs. The research reported in this thesis is a systematic investigation of this phenomenon in one front wheel of an automobile with the other three <b>wheels</b> in <b>true</b> balance. Known amounts of unbalance (both static and dynamic) were introduced into the left front wheel and road tests were conducted over a range of speeds covering resonance.
