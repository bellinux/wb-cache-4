5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two. The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah.|$|E

The park became a peaceful trading market, but by 2287 the Nuka-World ruins have been overrun by an alliance of raider gangs who use it as a personal fortress. Unlike the raiders featured in the base game, the raiders of Nuka-World are much more disciplined and organised, with each gang following a different ideology.|$|E
5|$|Fleming had a long-held {{interest}} in pirates, from the novels he {{read as a}} child, through to films such as Captain Blood (1935) with Errol Flynn, which he enjoyed watching. From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited Port Royal on {{the south of the}} island, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the background to Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in Port Maria Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the United States {{government}} {{listed the}} southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live {{mostly in the}} Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in {{the population in the}} past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.|$|E
5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Manila is also {{famed for}} its Art Deco theaters. Some {{of these were}} {{designed}} by National Artists for Architecture such as Juan Nakpil and Pablo Antonio. Unfortunately most of these theaters were neglected, {{and some of it}} have been demolished. The historic Escolta Street in Binondo features many buildings of Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architectural style, many of which were designed by prominent Filipino architects during the American Rule in the 1920s to the late 1930s. Many architects, artists, historians and heritage advocacy groups are pushing for the revival of Escolta Street, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> the premier street of the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to flow into the bay near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was drained and filled to create industrial land, using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E
5|$|Taunton {{includes}} an area named Holway <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> {{a village in}} its own right.

5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|The seafront {{stretches}} {{for approximately}} {{half a mile}} from the pier to Salthouse Field, and includes ornamental gardens, a Victorian bandstand, a bowling green, tennis courts, crazy golf and other amusements.

High Street is not directly accessible from the station, as the short one-block street is interrupted by a parking lot. However, Red Cross Place, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>once</b> a part of High Street, is directly accessible.|$|E
