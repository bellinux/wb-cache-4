500|$|Andronikos' {{decision}} aroused considerable {{opposition and}} criticism from contemporary scholars and officials {{almost from the}} outset, and historians like Pachymeres and Nikephoros Gregoras dwell long on the disastrous long-term effects of this short-sighted decision: piracy flourished, often augmented by the crews of the disbanded fleet who took service under Turkish and Latin masters, Constantinople was rendered defenceless towards the Italian maritime powers, {{and more and more}} Aegean islands fell under foreign rule—including Chios to the Genoese Benedetto Zaccaria, Rhodes and the Dodecanese to the Hospitallers, Lesbos and other islands to the Gattilusi. As Gregoras commented, [...] "if [...] had remained masters of the seas, as they had been, then the Latins would not have grown so arrogant , nor would the Turks ever have gazed upon the sands of the [...] sea, [...] nor would <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to everyone tribute every year." [...] After 1305, bowing to popular pressure and the need to contain the Catalan Company, the Emperor belatedly tried to rebuild the navy of 20 vessels, but although a few ships were built and a small fleet appears to have been active {{over the next couple of}} years, it eventually was disbanded again.|$|E

2500|$|Casualties {{have indeed}} {{appeared}} among workers, {{but it is}} not enough to stop us in our tracks. This is the price <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> it's nothing to be afraid of. Who knows how many people have been sacrificed on the battlefields and in the prisons ? Now we have a few cases of illness and death: it's nothing! ...|$|E

60|$|He's {{had a bad}} year--it's not his fault. And I was so ill {{after the}} baby died, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the doctor nearly fifty pounds.|$|R
5000|$|Our {{telephone}} {{bill was}} always a headache ... Once all three of our lines were cut off and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 240 dollars <b>to</b> get them plugged back in again.|$|R
2500|$|Robert Gates {{downplayed the}} {{significance}} of the aircraft by questioning how stealthy the J-20 may be, but stated the J-20 would [...] "put some of our capabilities at risk, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention to them, we have to respond appropriately with our own programs." [...] The U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that the United States knew about the program {{for a long time and}} that the test flight was not a surprise.|$|E
2500|$|Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 24 February 2012 the {{procedure}} for pardoning Tymoshenko could start [...] "after her trial" [...] and if she submitted a respective application to the President; he also mentioned that [...] "we should have all these cases considered again {{from the point of}} view of the new Criminal Procedure Code, which will comply with all European standards" [...] and he described the trial of Tymoshenko and other former officials as not [...] "meet European standards and principles" [...] (in May 2012 First Deputy General Prosecutor of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin also stated this in the European Parliament). On 27 February 2012 Tymoshenko's defense lawyer stated Tymoshenko will not file any applications for a pardon since [...] "Yanukovych recognized himself that the trial of Tymoshenko has nothing to do with justice according to European standards". Tymoshenko stated the same day [...] "Today we are behind bars. But if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> such a price for the liberation of the country, then we are ready to pay it".|$|E
6000|$|... "That don't make no odds," [...] Bill said cheerfully; [...] "this is {{a regular}} venture, this is; but I say, shan't <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{a lot for the}} boat?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of course <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{considerable}} attention <b>to</b> the raft, which at times tossed and pitched {{in a fashion}} that made me sick all over, and rendered it necessary to hold on tightly to prevent being swept overboard.|$|R
6000|$|We was rotten 'fore we started--we {{was never}} disciplined; [...] We {{made it out}} a favour if an order was obeyed; [...] Yes, every little drummer 'ad 'is rights an' wrongs to mind, [...] So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for teachin'--an' <b>we</b> paid! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For the {{building}} of his statue, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> <b>We</b> were forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tribute <b>to</b> Shinto Shrine (Japanese custom). There were some who resisted and said {{that we could not}} do, because we were Christians. Some of them died in a prison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This parting," [...] said Mary, [...] "is {{the worst}} of the price <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay....</b> Now it comes to the end there seem a {{thousand}} things one hasn't said...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] exclaimed {{the literal}} Roswell Gardiner, [...] "I think, deacon, {{that we have}} no great reason to complain. Southold, Shelter Island, and all the islands about here, for that matter, are pretty well off as to poor, and it is little enough that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for their support." ...|$|E
60|$|Similar results {{often occur}} from {{the change of}} leadership. The removal of our Officers from point to point, and even from country to country, {{is one of our}} most {{indispensable}} needs; but, of course, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for it, chiefly in the dislocation and discouragements and losses which it often necessarily entails.|$|E
6000|$|We was rotten 'fore {{we started}} -- we was never disciplined; [...] We {{made it out}} a favour if an order was obeyed; [...] Yes, every little drummer 'ad 'is rights an' wrongs to mind, [...] So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for teachin' -- an' we paid! ...|$|R
5000|$|... “We’re {{talking about}} {{five days of}} nonstop exposure,” said Coleman, {{who served as a}} judge at this year’s Miss World America {{competition}} at the Gaylord National in July. “How many other events get you that kind of international impact? If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for this amount of advertising, it would’ve cost us half a billion dollars.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know Campos, José H. Campos," [...] he volunteered. [...] "The dirty cur's stuck Carson up {{for twenty}} {{thousand}} pesos. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> or he'd <b>have</b> compelled half our peons to enlist or set the wells on fire. And you know, Davies, what we've done {{for him in}} past years. Gratitude? Simple decency? Great Scott!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] he said, [...] "you won't {{have any}} trouble {{settling}} up—no debts or anything of that. I believe there's a bit to leave—so it's not so bad. Poor devil—he was very down at the last; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> at one end or the other. What on earth is the old girl after?" [...] he asked, {{looking up at the}} raftered ceiling, which was rumbling and thundering with the old lady's violent rummaging.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I say, is this," [...] said Mr. O'Leary. [...] "Let 'em manage for 'emselves. God bless my sowl! Why {{we shall}} be skinned alive if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> all this money back to Government. If Government chooses to squander {{thousands}} in this way, Government should bear the brunt. That's what I say." [...] Eventually, Government, that is the whole nation, did bear the brunt. But {{it would not have}} been very wise to promise this at the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the kind}} of {{official}} trash <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes to keep up," [...] said Ira, who somehow felt that if public policy was not amenable to private sentiment there was no value in free government. Mrs. Beasley, however, complacently resumed her dish-washing, and Ira returned to his riata in the adjoining room. For quite an interval {{there was no sound}} but the occasional click of a dish laid upon its pile, with fingers that, however, were firm and untremulous. Presently Sue's low voice was heard.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{night we}} were there," [...] said Miss Mela, [...] "they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> turn the gas down all through {{one part of}} it, and the papers said the ladies were awful mad because they couldn't show their diamonds. I don't wonder, if they all <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> as much for their boxes as <b>we</b> did. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> sixty dollars." [...] She looked at the Marches for their {{sensation}} at this expense.|$|R
60|$|PERSIAN. Because <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{blood money}} {{for some of}} them. Better let the Romans kill them: it is cheaper.|$|R
60|$|Possibly this {{indifference}} {{may seem}} undesirable. But we must {{bear in mind}} that the whole problem is hard to cope with, it is an aspect of failure, and no sentimental juggling with facts will convert the business into a beautiful or desirable thing. Somehow or other <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> All expedients must be palliatives, all will involve sacrifices; we must, no doubt, adopt some of them for our present necessities, but they are like famine relief works, to adopt them in permanence is a counsel of despair.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could fill}} a volume {{as large as}} the history of the Wise Men of Gotham with a {{catalogue}} only of some wonderful laws and customs we have observed within thirty years past.[8] 'Tis true indeed, our beneficial traffic of wool with France, hath been our only support for several years past, furnishing us all the little money <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> our rents and go to market. But our merchants assure me, [...] "This trade hath received a great damp by the present fluctuating condition of the coin in France; and that most of their wine is paid for in specie, without carrying thither any commodity from hence." ...|$|E
6000|$|But it {{was beyond}} human nature to endure this longer, and John {{interrupted}} almost with a scream. [...] "O, wheest!" [...] he cried, [...] "that's not all, that's not the worst of it--it's nothing! How could I tell you were proud of me? O! I wish, I wish that I had known; but you always said I was such a disgrace! And the dreadful thing is this: we were all taken up last night, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Collette's fine among the six, or we'll be had up for evidence--shebeening it is. They made me swear to tell you; but for my part," [...] he cried, bursting into tears, [...] "I just wish that I was dead!" [...] And he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very impertinent. <b>We</b> all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{for each}} other all the while and {{for each other}}'s virtues as well as vices." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{brilliant}} suggestion was, {{needless to}} say, received with acclamation; and I instantly {{set to work}} to buy suitable canoes from the surrounding natives. I succeeded after a delay of three days in obtaining two large ones, each hollowed out of a single log of some light wood, and capable of holding six people and baggage. For these two canoes <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> nearly all our remaining cloth, and also many other articles.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{know nothing}} of his wars," [...] a woman said. [...] "They take our sons from us, {{and we do not}} see them again. We did hear a report that he had gone, with an army, to conquer Travancore. But why he should want to do it, none of us can make out. His dominions are as wide as the heart of man can require. It is strange that he cannot rest contented, but, like his father, should be always taking our sons away to fight. However, these things are beyond the {{understanding}} of poor people like us; but we can't help thinking {{that it would be better}} if he were to send his armies to destroy all the tigers. If he would do that, we should not grudge the sums <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> when the tax gatherers come round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{cost of a}} thing," [...] says he, [...] "is THE AMOUNT OF WHAT I WILL CALL LIFE {{which is}} {{required}} to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." [...] I have been accustomed to put it to myself, perhaps more clearly, that the price <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for money is paid in liberty. Between these two ways of it, at least, the reader will probably not fail to find a third definition of his own; and it follows, on one or other, that a man may pay too dearly for his livelihood, by giving, in Thoreau's terms, his whole life for it, or, in mine, bartering for it the whole of his available liberty, and becoming a slave till death. There are two questions to be considered - the quality of what we buy, and the price <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for it. Do you want a thousand a year, a two thousand a year, or a ten thousand a year livelihood? and can you afford the one you want? It {{is a matter of}} taste; it is not in the least degree a question of duty, though commonly supposed so. But there is no authority for that view anywhere. It is nowhere in the Bible. It is true that we might do a vast amount of good if we were wealthy, but it is also highly improbable; not many do; and the art of growing rich is not only quite distinct from that of doing good, but the practice of the one does not at all train a man for practising the other. [...] "Money might be of great service to me," [...] writes Thoreau; [...] "but the difficulty now is that I do not improve my opportunities, and therefore I am not prepared to have my opportunities increased." [...] It is a mere illusion that, above a certain income, the personal desires will be satisfied and leave a wider margin for the generous impulse. It is as difficult to be generous, or anything else, except perhaps a member of Parliament, on thirty thousand as on two hundred a year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Bible talk don't go {{for much}} in politics. Sabba' days are {{set aside for}} the Bible, and week-days for public and private matters. Now, here is Hugh Littlepage, of the same flesh and blood as my {{neighbor}} Holmes and myself be--no better and no worse; yes, I'm willing to allow he's no worse, in the main, though in some things I do think we might claim the preference; but I'll allow he's no worse, for the sake of argooment. Each on us rents a farm of this Littlepage, of a hundred acres good. Wa-al, this land we till, and crop, and labor, with our own hands, and the hands of our sons, and hired help, perhaps; and yet <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> fifty dollars apiece, annually, to that youngster, Hugh Littlepage, for rent; which money he takes and squanders where he pleases, in riotous livin', for't we know. Now, is that right, I ask; and isn't it an onsuitable state of things for a republican country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{she lives}} in our Rajah's house. She will not die soon. Such women live a long time," [...] said Babalatchi, with a slight tinge of regret in his voice. [...] "She has dollars, and she has buried them, but we know where. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> much trouble with those people. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a fine and listen to threats from the white men, and now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be careful."

60|$|What of his preeminent position, the First Hall-man was {{reputed to}} be quite wealthy. In {{addition}} to his miscellaneous grafts, he grafted on us. We farmed the general wretchedness, and the First Hall-man was Farmer-General over all of us. We held our particular grafts by his permission, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for that permission. As I say, he was {{reputed to be}} wealthy; but we never saw his money, and {{he lived in a}} cell all to himself in solitary grandeur.|$|R
