The assessment is based on the detonation-driven 304 L steel spherical-cap fragmentation experiments of Campbell et al. (2007). Metrics used for purposes of validation include the velocity history of a <b>witness</b> <b>point</b> of the shell and the histogram of recovered fragment sizes. The results of the simulations are found to be in overall good agreement with the experimental measurements, especially when allowances are made for uncertainties in the characterization of the drive and material properties. The ability of the approach to predictively simulate exceedingly complex patterns of fracture and fragmentation under severe conditions of loading and material behavior is remarkable, especially in consideration of the simplicity of the fracture model and its implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. By a {{numerical}} continuation method called a diagonal homotopy, one can compute {{the intersection of}} two irreducible positive dimensional solution sets of polynomial systems. This paper proposes to use this diagonal homotopy as the key step in a procedure to intersect general solution sets that are not necessarily irreducible or even equidimensional. Of particular interest is the special case {{where one of the}} sets is de¯ned by a single polynomial equation. This leads to an algorithm for ¯nding a numeri-cal representation of the solution set of a system of polynomial equations introducing the equations one by one. Preliminary computational experiments show this approach can exploit the special structure of a polynomial system, which improves the performance of the path following algorithms. Key words.

Moreover, the determination of singularities inclusive of their local environments and the computation of <b>witness</b> <b>points</b> on each connected intersection curve component are described. The required computations can be realised (a) e ciently by solving quartic polynomials at most and (b) exactly by using an exact arithmetic.

40|$|Polynomial systems {{arise in}} many applications: robotics, kinematics, {{chemical}} kinetics, computer vision, truss design, geometric modeling, and many others. Many polynomial systems have solutions sets, called algebraic varieties, having several irreducible components. A fundamental {{problem of the}} numerical algebraic geometry is to decompose such an algebraic variety into its irreducible components. The <b>witness</b> <b>point</b> sets are the natural numerical data structure to encode irreducible algebraic varieties. Sommese, Verschelde and Wampler represented the irreducible algebraic decomposition of an affine algebraic variety X as a union of finite disjoint sets ∪_i= 0 ^dW_i=∪_i= 0 ^d(∪_j= 1 ^d_iW_ij) called numerical irreducible decomposition. The W_i correspond to the pure i-dimensional components, and the W_ij represent the i-dimensional irreducible components. The numerical irreducible decomposition is implemented in BERTINI. We modify this concept using partially Gröbner bases, triangular sets, local dimension, and the so-called zero sum relation. We present in the second chapter the corresponding algorithms and their implementations in SINGULAR. We give some examples and timings, which show that the modified algorithms are more efficient {{if the number of}} variables is not too large. For a large number of variables BERTINI is more efficient. Leykin presented an algorithm to compute the embedded components of an algebraic variety based on the concept of the deflation of an algebraic variety. Depending on the modified algorithm mentioned above, we will present in the third chapter an algorithm and its implementation in SINGULAR to compute the embedded components. The irreducible decomposition of algebraic varieties allows us to formulate in the fourth chapter some numerical algebraic algorithms. In the last chapter we present two SINGULAR libraries. The first library is used to compute the numerical irreducible decomposition and the embedded components of an algebraic variety. The second library contains the procedures of the algorithms in the last Chapter to test inclusion, equality of two algebraic varieties, to compute the degree of a pure i-dimensional component, and the local dimension. ...|$|E
