500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking {{shot out of the}} bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> and {{we had a great time}} working out how to do it," [...] Joel said.

It was the first show that the Gunmen carried and I had a real good time shepherding Tommy, Dean, and Bruce, 'cause [...] they were nervous, they had the whole hour to carry." [...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner.

[...] Manners later noted that the sequence [...] "really worked out well".|$|E

She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that.

And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [...] 'She can't say songbird.' [...] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult."

Popjustice saw the music video in progress on October 22, 2008, in the edit they reported that the music video was produced on a green screen, but the concept of the video was to be Aguilera in an edit suite pressing various flashing buttons, editing what was her own music video. Aguilera herself discussed the production of the video, saying [...] "I really enjoyed making the video for 'Keeps Gettin' Better', being an artist who likes to play around with different looks, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> to portray various characters within the same shoot."

500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast before we started shooting. We went into the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun,</b> but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in.

500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a score 7.5 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the episode's [...] "wonky pacing and story progression" [...] and given its [...] "legitimate two-part storyline" [...] was disappointed it was not more cohesive than the previous year's crossover. He felt the [...] crossover [...] "had a fairly rocky start" [...] and wondered whether Arrows characters were actually necessary to the storyline. Even so, Scheden said, [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> to be had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains" [...] and {{was looking forward to}} a focused conclusion. The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode an [...] "A", saying: [...] ""Legends Of Today” is a sterling example of how to do this crossover thing right." [...] He noted that the episode wove ongoing storylines [...] "into an expansive DC Universe adventure" [...] calling it [...] "the most purely enjoyable outing of the season so far".|$|E
500|$|Lana was a [...] "pretty" [...] Canadian {{high school}} student. She left her {{old high school}} due to {{homophobic}} bullying, {{and as a result}} she became [...] "very closeted". Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated [...] "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's carefully constructed façade has a purpose." [...] Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by [...] "sleazy" [...] photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her [...] "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, [...] "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly.

500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie to feel like a fairy tale, but still grounded. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> for us because {{we got to go}} back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E
