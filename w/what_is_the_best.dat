500|$|Reviews for the PlayStation 2 and Wii {{versions}} of Crash: Mind over Mutant were generally positive. Dakota Grabowski of GameZone considered the game [...] "slightly better" [...] than Crash of the Titans, noting improvements in controls, gameplay and storyline from its predecessor, but lamented that [...] "the camera almost ruins the whole package." [...] The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was also met positively, though {{not to the}} same degree as the PlayStation 2 version. Louis Bedigian of GameZone stated that the young demographic of the Crash Bandicoot series [...] "may be annoyed by the camera and/or repetitive objectives but will be entertained by <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Crash game developed in a long time – {{and one of the best}} Mario clones released for Nintendo Wii."

500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber. [...] The question is not now whether we would like to control our natural resources, but <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way to get them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing exactly what you want to do or the material you have to do it with, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> way of doing it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1911 it {{was clear}} that the {{development}} of aircraft had reached the point where they were of military significance. [...] France, the world leader in aviation at the time, had over 200 aircraft in military service. In contrast, Britain’s total military aircraft strength was nineteen aircraft, of which, in the words of Colonel J.E.B Seely, Under-Secretary of State for War, [...] "one is broken beyond repair and one is quite out of date. Others are more or less under repair" [...] adding [...] "We are arriving at a point when we think we see our way to choose <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> type, first for teaching people to fly, and secondly, to buy for the purposes of war should war unfortunately break out". The only practical step that had been taken by the War Office was the creation of an establishment for the scientific examination of the various problems involved in aircraft design. [...] After some consultation with the Royal Aero Club and various aircraft manufacturers, they announced their [...] "Specification for a Military Aeroplane" [...] in late December, the details being published in Flight magazine on 23 December 1911.|$|E
2500|$|By 1936, the {{tensions}} between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and {{was interested in the}} racial studies being conducted by Giulio Cogni. [...] Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists. Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory. On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book Il Razzismo (1936). Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians. Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions. As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies. He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in European civilization. [...] Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.|$|E
2500|$|The age {{at which}} CP is {{diagnosed}} is important, but there is disagreement over <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> age to make the diagnosis. The earlier CP is diagnosed correctly, the better the opportunities are to provide the child with physical and education help, but {{there might be a}} greater chance that CP will be confused with another problem, especially if the child is 18 months of age or younger. Infants may have temporary problems with muscle tone or control that can be confused with CP, which is permanent. A metabolism disorder or tumors in the nervous system may appear to be CP; metabolic disorders, in particular, can produce brain problems that look like CP on an MRI. Disorders that deteriorate the white matter in the brain and problems that cause spasms and weakness in the legs, may be mistaken for CP when they first appear early in life. However, these disorders get worse over time, and CP does not (although it may change in character). In infancy it may not be possible {{to tell the difference between}} them. In the UK, not being able to sit independently by the age of 8 months is regarded as a clinical sign for further monitoring. [...] Fragile X syndrome (a cause of autism and intellectual disability) and general intellectual disability must also be ruled out. Cerebral palsy specialist John McLaughlin recommends waiting until the child is 36 months of age before making a diagnosis, because by that age, motor capacity is easier to assess.|$|E
