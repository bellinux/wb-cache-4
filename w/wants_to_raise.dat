5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of many to feature Mulder as a Christlike figure. In We Want to Believe, Amy Donaldson writes that the episode is the most {{dramatic}} of Mulder's [...] "multiple resurrections". She compares his resurrection to Jesus's, who Mulder outdoes [...] "by staying in the grave for three months instead of simply three days." [...] During Mulder's funeral the minister reads John 11:25–26: [...] "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". According to scripture, Jesus spoke these words when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars note that the verse also foreshadows his resurrection. The verse was also used by a necromancer in the seventh-season's [...] "Millennium", but for the wrong reason. The necromancer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the dead by reciting the verse, but only their bodies return as zombies. In [...] "Deadalive", Mulder returns from the dead in both mind and body.|$|E
