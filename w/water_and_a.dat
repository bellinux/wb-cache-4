5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue from any other outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy relic of the True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just {{to protect it from}} the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had a fear of <b>water.</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E

5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> great deal of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{settlement}} on Lord Howe {{was established in}} June 1834 when the British whaling barque Caroline, sailing from New Zealand and commanded by Captain John Blinkenthorpe, landed at what {{is now known as}} Blinky Beach. They left three men, George Ashdown, James Bishop and Chapman, who were employed by a Sydney whaling firm to establish a supply station. The men were initially to provide meat by fishing and by raising pigs and goats from feral stock. They landed with (or acquired from a visiting ship) their Māori wives and two Māori boys. Huts were built in an area now known as Old Settlement which had a supply of fresh <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> garden was established west of Blinky Beach.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form {{the core of the}} early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> number of other miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|Under most circumstances, the {{blacktip reef shark}} has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than wading through shallow <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> way of discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive {{in the presence of}} bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.|$|E

A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds he loves the books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he ever gets past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{under the}} command of Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, was fully mobilised by late December 1943, with orders to prepare for {{airborne}} operations to be conducted during mid-1944. The division's first airborne operation would also be the first time it saw combat, conducting Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5/6 June, D-Day. It was tasked with guarding the left flank of the British amphibious landings by securing the area east of the city of Caen, capturing a number of bridges that spanned several rivers and canals, and then preventing any Axis forces from advancing on the British beaches. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was given several tasks to accomplish. The 9th Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, was to assault and destroy the Merville Gun Battery, as well as capturing high ground and setting up roadblocks. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was to destroy two bridges, and the 8th Parachute Battalion had the task of destroying three bridges. When the operation began, the brigade suffered from a combination of poor navigation by the pilots of their C-47 Dakota transport aircraft, heavy cloud cover and incorrectly marked drop zones, which led to all of its units being scattered over a wide area; Hill himself was dropped with several sticks from the 1st Canadian and 9th Parachute Battalions near the River Dives. He landed in a submerged river rank approximately half a mile from Cabourg, and was forced to wade through four feet of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> number of flooded irrigation ditches before reaching dry land; the same flooded areas claimed the lives of a number of paratroopers from his brigade.|$|E
