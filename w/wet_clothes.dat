The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for a whole day and night. They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his <b>wet</b> <b>clothes.</b> He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E

500|$|Officials {{believe that}} a knife from the kitchen had been smeared with blood and placed near the body, while a {{duplicate}} of the knife which was missing from a set found in Ward's bedroom {{would have been more}} consistent with the wounds to Wone's body. The autopsy revealed evidence of some degree of suffocation, perhaps by a pillow, and puncture marks on his neck, chest, foot and hand. Though no toxins were found in his blood, a lack of evidence of struggle led investigators to suspect Wone had been injected with a paralytic agent. Cadaver dogs found a blood residue in a dryer lint trap and the patio drain, which detectives believe may be evidence that someone washed themselves in the back patio area, and dried <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> in the dryer. City Paper Columnist Jason Cherkis reported unattributed criticism of the medical examiner's failure to test for exotic drugs and to keep a sample of Wone's blood for later testing, as well as detectives' failure to follow up on a lint trap that had attracted a cadaver dog's attention. Price's lawyer has challenged the timing of the indictments, has said that the civil suit [...] "looked unseemly", and questioned whether the prosecutors and Wone family attorneys were acting in concert.|$|E
500|$|On 14 December, {{the party}} {{were more than}} [...] from the Cape Denison hut. As Mertz skied ahead, singing songs from his student days, Ninnis, the largest sledge and the strongest dog team were lost when they broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. Together {{with the death of}} their companion, Mawson and Mertz were now {{severely}} compromised; on the remaining sledge they had just ten days' worth of food, and no food for the dogs. They immediately turned back west, gradually using the six remaining dogs to supplement their food supply; they ate all parts of the animals, including their livers. They initially made good progress, but as they cleared the largest glacier Mertz began to feel ill; he had lost his waterproof overpants on Ninnis' sledge, and in the cold his <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> were unable to dry. On 30 December, a day Mawson recorded that the companion was [...] "off colour", Mertz wrote that he was [...] "really tired [...] shall write no more."

2500|$|Winter backpacking {{requires}} {{a higher level}} of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. Skis or snowshoes may be required to traverse deep snow, or crampons and an ice axe where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. [...] Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> quickly sap body heat and can lead to frostbite or hypothermia.|$|E
2500|$|Matthews {{reports that}} when a member of Company B accidentally dropped his pocketwatch into the latrine pit one morning, he paid a black cook $5.00 to get it out. Men from the {{regiment}} stripped and washed their socks, underwear and shirts in a creek without using soap or boiling water; then they put on dry socks, pants, coats and shoes while waiting for their <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> to dry in the sununless they were ordered to move out, in which case they simply put on their sopping clothes and let them dry on their bodies. Men tried to bathe their feet at least once every twenty-four hours, striving to always keep a pair of dry socks to keep their feet from becoming [...] "sore." [...] Half-ripe walnuts and fruit were forbidden for sanitary reasons, and soldiers caught eating them were punished by being forced to dig latrine pits.|$|E

50|$|Detainees were blindfolded {{to prevent}} them {{identifying}} their assailants. Almost all detainees had marks on their noses and wrists caused by tight blindfolding and handcuffing. Sometimes handcuffs were applied so tightly as to cause a loss of sensation in the hands. Sleep deprivation techniques included the use of cold water, physical beatings and loud noises. Most detainees reported being forced to remain standing for long periods, often on one leg, and sometimes being suspended by ropes in painful positions. The effect of extremely cold temperatures was enhanced by <b>wetting</b> <b>clothes</b> and bedding. Cigarette burns and electric shocks were inflicted on at least 100 detainees. A number of detainees were sexually assaulted by touching and violent handling of their genitals or finger thrusts and the insertion of objects including hosepipes and ends of rifle barrels into the anus.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{claims have}} been made as to what {{actually}} happened during the event. According to many witnesses, {{after a period of}} rain, the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The sun was then reported to have careened towards the earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> became [...] "suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling". Not all witnesses reported seeing the sun [...] "dance". Some people only saw the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, saw nothing at all. The only known picture of the sun taken during the event shows nothing unusual.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{claims have}} been made as to what {{actually}} happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God.

2500|$|Beatings at Kemna, as {{at other}} early {{concentration}} camps, were frequent, {{beginning with the}} [...] "welcome beating" [...] on arrival at the camp right through to having to run a gauntlet when leaving. Because prisoners and guards were political opponents who were former neighbors and co-workers, punishment and torture at Kemna took on a personal nature. Prisoners were brought to interrogations naked and gagged with cloth stuffed in their mouths, were tied to special whipping benches, where they were whipped with rubber clubs, whips and sticks. Bleeding, they were then locked in a cubicle under the stairs, where they could neither sit nor stand and cigarette smoke was blown through the air holes. Beforehand, prisoners were made to eat [...] "appetizers" [...] of unsoaked salt herring smeared with lubricating grease or feces; when they regurgitated, {{they were forced to}} lick up the vomit. In November, prisoners with fresh wounds were thrown into the cold waters of the Wupper and afterwards, made to stay in their <b>wet</b> <b>clothes.</b> There were also simulated executions. According to one former SA paramedic, about 25 prisoners attempted suicide; others succeeded or simply died from the effects of the torture. Some survivors were crippled mentally or physically from their treatment, some {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{sent out}} patrols to Glei {{and the river}} Amu to check on reports that the Germans had stopped their retirement.

Few of the casualties were suffering from sickness, despite living in <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> due to the climate.

2500|$|The raiders {{split up}} at this point, and in the confusion, Boyce was left behind with the lorry driving without him. He was not yet {{concerned}} about being pursued and was walking to the lorry, keeping a lookout for stragglers, when it suddenly took off when he was 50 yards away. He ran after the lorry {{but was unable to}} catch up. He then unsuccessfully tried to break into an RUC car parked nearby before resigning to walk the 20 miles back to the border. Boyce got as far as the Clogher Valley area, and while taking off his boiler suit in a ditch, he was captured by a Protestant farmer and his five sons, all of whom were heavily armed. He experienced some degree of police brutality following his capture, being [...] "cuffed about" [...] and forced to dress and undress in his <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> six times, before being transported back to Omagh to stand trial. At his trial, which he and his men refused to recognise, Boyce told the court [...] "This war was not waged against any Irishman, but against a foreign Queen who has no right to have her forces on our soil." [...] The 27-year-old Boyce, who was identified by authorities as the leader in the raid, was sentenced to twelve years penal servitude in Belfast Gaol. The rest of the men involved received ten years each.|$|E
2500|$|Usually, the maquis {{and their}} Anglo-American allies would cut down a tree {{to block a}} road in the wooded section of the French countryside, {{sometimes}} an anti-tank mine would be planted under the tree trunk and the Germans would be ambushed with machine gun and sniper fire when they attempted to remove the tree blocking the road. Such operations seriously delayed the Germans with the elite 2nd Waffen SS Division Das Reich taking 18 days to travel from Toulouse to Caen, a journey that was expected to take only 3 days. The [...] "Jed" [...] Tommy Macpherson who was attached to a maquis band of 27 French and Spanish communists taught the maquisards to fire their Sten guns with <b>wet</b> <b>clothes</b> wrapped around the barrels, which made the Sten guns sound like heavy machine guns to experienced troops, which meant when the maquis ambushed {{the men of the}} Das Reich division, the SS took cover and responded more far cautiously than they would have if they had known that they only under fire from Sten guns. In a typical ambush of the Das Reich division, Macpherson had a bomb planted on a bridge to knock out a half-truck while having the maquis fire on the SS; when a Panther tank came up to engage the maquis, one of the maquisards threw a [...] "Gammon grenade", which knocked out the tank tracks. As more of the SS tanks began to shell the maquis, Macpherson ordered his men to retreat, content to know he had delayed the Das Reich division by several hours and that he would do the same again the next day, and the next. On 9 June 1944, the Das Reich division took revenge for maquis attacks by hanging 99 people selected at random in the town of Tulle from all the lampposts in the town. The next day, the Der Führer regiment of the Das Reich division destroyed the town of Oradour-sur-Glane, killing 642 people including 246 women and 207 children. SS Sturmbannführer Adolf Diekmann, the commanding officer of the Der Führer regiment [...] of the Das Reich division had wanted to destroy another French town Oradour-sur-Vayres, whose people were said to be providing food and shelter to the maquis, but had taken a wrong turn on the road, which led him and his men to Oradour-sur-Glance, whose people had never supported the maquis. One Wehrmacht division transferred from the Eastern Front to the Western Front took a week to move from the Soviet Union to the borders of France and another three weeks to move from the French border to the Battle of Caen as Resistance attacks slowed down its movement. An estimate by SHAEF stated the Germans were moving at only 25% of their normal daily speed due to the constant attacks of the maquis all across France.|$|E
