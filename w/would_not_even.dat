5|$|The {{jury was}} impanelled on January 18. The {{indictment}} was read and Cannon delivered his opening statement. Most {{of the evidence}} pertained to the robbery counts, resulting in speculation that the other counts <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be tried if a robbery conviction could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to contemporary-style plays such as Madame de Sade, Mishima wrote {{for two of}} the three genres of classical Japanese theatre: Noh and Kabuki (as a proud Tokyoite, he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> attend the Bunraku puppet theatre, always associated with Osaka and the provinces).|$|E
25|$|His sympathies, however, {{were all}} on their side, and he would do nothing to {{diminish}} their chances of success. He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> oppose the doctrine of innate ideas, because it looked with a friendly eye upon piety and morality. He granted that it might, perhaps, {{be the case that}} ideas were both born with us and afterwards impressed upon us from without.|$|E
25|$|Ince's {{second season}} with Liverpool was again trophyless (seventh {{place in the}} league meant they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be {{competing}} in the UEFA Cup the following season) but he achieved a personal high point when he scored a late equaliser against Manchester United at Anfield and celebrated with some ferocity {{in front of the}} Kop, though it wasn't enough to deprive United of the Premier League title that formed part of their treble success.|$|E

25|$|Careful training: When {{his troops}} {{were not on}} {{military}} campaigns to win back lost Chinese territory in the north, Yue put his men through intense training. Apart from troop movement and weapons drills, this training also involved them leaping over walls and crawling through moats in full battle garb. The intensity of the training was such that the men <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> try to visit their families if they passed by their homes while on movement and even trained on their days off.|$|E
25|$|The AOA {{apparently}} {{looked at}} two options, using {{two of the}} s' 34 MW S6W reactors, and halving {{one of the two}} 550 MW(th) A4W reactors used in s. The first option <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> match Zumwalt for power, while the second option probably would not fit into the Zumwalt hull. On the other hand, it would give plenty of headroom for future weapon systems such as directed-energy weapons and railguns, hence the proposal for the BMD ship of a larger hull with nuclear propulsion.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{mobilization}} {{of ethnic groups}} can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic or ideological appeals. Hence, {{it is difficult to}} completely discount the role of inherent ethnic differences. Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could be tempted to mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states. Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted {{at the expense of other}} ethnicities.|$|E
5000|$|However, some Spanish {{speakers}} {{are concerned}} that this proposal {{is unlikely to be}} adopted, since the Spanish language does not distinguish [...] and [...] from [...] and [...] respectively, and most of its speakers <b>would</b> therefore <b>not</b> <b>even</b> notice a difference in pronunciation.|$|R

25|$|After Wyatt's death, Josephine {{collaborated with}} two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to {{document}} her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone. The most she would say is that {{she returned to the}} Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone. She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} {{school for the}} deaf (then called the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the {{position}} of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was {{the policy of the}} school until 1979. A documentary film about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1952, Garfield {{moved out}} of his New York {{apartment}} for the last time, indicating to friends {{it was not a}} temporary separation from his wife Roberta. He confided to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in Look magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called Taxi, but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.|$|E

25|$|Carlos, Verdi baritone. Incorporating {{the deep}} tones that a bass has, while having an upper range {{approaching}} {{that of a}} tenor, Carlos' voice type is high even for a usual baritone. A Verdi baritone refers to a voice capable of singing consistently and with ease in the highest part of the baritone range, up to A4, sometimes even up to the B♭4. The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from G♭2 up to B♭4. The *unofficial* sheet music for their first album claims he sings down to a D2, however this is atypical of a baritone. Most basses <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be required to sing such notes. During the Live at The Greek Theatre concert, he hit B4 singing I Believe in You.|$|E
25|$|Although KFUO {{was well}} {{received}} and well supported, Maier envisioned a broader audience {{than could be}} reached by constructing local radio stations. By 1929, {{with the goal of}} spreading the gospel from coast-to-coast, he was investigating the logistics of network broadcasting. At this time, the major radio networks donated air time to the Federal Council of Churches, but no single denomination had ever produced a nationwide radio show dedicated to spreading the gospel. Having persuaded the Missouri Synod of the validity of this project, Maier contacted the National Broadcasting Company early in 1930. He was disappointed to find that NBC would not donate air time to the Lutheran Church, or any other single denomination. Worse still, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> allow the Lutheran Church to purchase air time. NBC’s policy, Maier was told, precluded putting religious time on a commercial basis.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 2001, Columbia House Television began {{releasing}} I Love Lucy on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> begin to release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail order subscribers. All these DVDs have the identical features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets in retail.|$|E
60|$|And what a {{welcoming}} it was! 'Come upstairs, mamma, {{come into the}} drawing-room,' said Gertrude, who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> stop <b>even</b> to kiss her mother till they found themselves secured from the servants' eyes.

25|$|To assert its {{sovereignty}} {{on the northern}} Connecticut River, the Massachusetts Bay Colony sent Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey to survey and mark the boundary. They accidentally marked the boundary with Rhode Island significantly farther than the royally decreed three {{miles south of the}} southernmost part of the Charles River. Instead of traversing the territory of Massachusetts by land, they sailed around and up the Connecticut River, calculating the same latitude at which they had misplaced the stake on the Rhode Island border. This compounded the error even further, resulting in a four to seven mile discrepancy between where the border should have been and where it was marked, and awarding more territory to Massachusetts Bay than it had been granted by its charter. Though it was suspicious of this survey, Connecticut <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> receive a charter until 1662, and so the dispute would lie dormant for several decades.|$|E
25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> show the screenplay {{to the young}} actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant {{got the idea for}} Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{onto the}} scene, the headstrong and ambitious Zhao Wenhua came {{into conflict with}} the coastal military and administration. He plotted against grand coordinator Cao Bangfu (曹邦輔), whose rapid action against bandit forces at Lake Tai prevented Zhao from claiming credit for the success there. When his own forces were forced to retreat at Taozhai, Zhao placed the blame for his own failure on Cao, {{and was able to}} have him arrested and exiled. Of greater consequence was his role in the downfall of the supreme commander Zhang Jing. Zhao Wenhua had urged Zhang Jing, who had been gathering his strength, to attack the pirates, but Zhang resisted and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> discuss his strategy with him. Zhao Wenhua retaliated by writing a memorial to the throne accusing Zhang Jing of deliberately delaying the operation for his own profit. However, soon after Zhao Wenhua sent out the memorial, Zhang Jing achieved a major victory over the pirates at Wangjiangjing (王江涇) on 10 May 1555. Too late to recant his earlier statement, Zhao was quick to claim the credit for himself and his protege Hu Zongxian; as a result he was able to successfully petition the Court for the execution of Zhang Jing.|$|E
