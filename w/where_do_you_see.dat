40|$|The {{focus of}} our JOVE {{research}} has been to develop a field instrument that provides high quality data for atmospheric corrections and in-flight calibration of airborne and satellite remote sensing imaging systems. The instrument package {{is known as the}} Portable Ground-based Atmospheric Monitoring System or PGAMS. PGAMS collects a comprehensive set of spectroscopic/radiometric observations that describe the optical properties of the atmosphere and reflectance of a target area on the earth's surface {{at the time of the}} aircraft or satellite overpass. To date, the PGAMS instrument system and control software has been completed and used for data collection in several NASA field experiments across the continental US and Puerto Rico. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> your JOVE research going after the initial JOVE Funding Expires?

Andrea Brady: The original motivation, actually, was being given money by Brunel University for a project on new poetry. In a very practical sense, it was about redistributing wealth among the poets, even a small amount, {{to pay for their}} time and recognise their contributions to contemporary writing. But that’s kind of off the record. The other motivation was realising that there are a great number of sites in America which offer records of this kind of writing. They help to distribute poetry which may seem inaccessible when it’s on the page, through voice or through video files. But there are very few sites of that kind in the UK. As a consequence, if you’re researching poetry on the web and you are not clued into the narrow networks of distribution for innovative British poetry, you might think that there is very little of it, or that what there is is not very diverse. My idea was that in making a site like this we could convey the full diversity of poetic practices in the UK, to a wider audience both nationally and internationally. Compared to a site like ‘The Poetry Archive ’ whic...|$|E

Convened a week after the University of Zaragoza’s “Memory Frictions” conference, where Cheyette, Gibbs, Andermahr and Allwork gave papers, the Northampton symposium and round-table was sponsored by The School of The Arts to coincide with Andermahr’s guest editorship of this special issue of Humanities. Craps, Cheyette and Gibbs addressed five questions during the round-table. Namely, does trauma studies suffer from a form of psychological universalism? Do you see any signs that trauma studies is becoming more decolonized? What are the challenges of a decolonized trauma studies for disciplinary thinking? How does a decolonized trauma studies relate to pedagogical ethics? Finally, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the future of the field? While this edited transcript retains a certain informality of style, it offers a significant contribution to knowledge by capturing a unique exchange between three key thinkers in contemporary trauma studies, providing a timely analysis of the impact of postcolonial theory on trauma studies, the state of the field and its future possibilities. Issues addressed include the problematic scholarly tendency to universalize a western model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); the question of the centrality of the Holocaust in trauma studies and the implications of this for the study of atrocities globally; the vexed issues posed by the representation of perpetrators; as well as how the basic tenets of western cultural trauma theory, until recently so often characterized by a Caruth-inspired focus on belatedness and afterwardness, are being rethought, both in response to developments in the US and in answer to the challenge to ‘decolonize’ trauma studies.

K. and Scandinavia and other developing countries, have come under pressure to become more efficient and effective, to reduce their demands on taxpayers, while maintaining the volume and quality of services supplied to the public. To achieve this, they have been subjected to the introduction of various performance management techniques. Content analyses of published and unpublished articles, books, strategic plans of selected public sector, were selected randomly through different sources that contains the application of PMT in local government. It was observed from the analyses that performance management is diversely in management practice in the selected metropolitan boroughs. Řízení výkonnosti se dostalo na vrchol pozornosti managementu veřejného sektoru, protože mnoho služeb se ve vyspělejších ekonomikách, jako jsou Spojené království, Skandinávie a další země, dostalo pod tlak, aby se staly efektivnějšími a účinnějšími. Tím by se snížily požadavky na daňové poplatníky při udržení stejného objemu a kvality veřejných služeb. Proto, aby toho bylo dosaženo, bylo zavedeno mnoho technik řízení výkonnosti. Pro provedení výzkumu v této práci byla použita metoda kvalitativního výzkumu. Obsahové analýzy publikovaných a nepublikovaných článků, knih, strategických plánů vybraných měst byly náhodně vybrány z různých zdrojů, které zahrnovaly aplikaci technik řízení výkonnosti v místní správě. Z analýz bylo zjištěno, že řízení výkonnosti je ve správní praxi ve vybraných metropolitních obcích různorodé.

6000|$|Well, {{the first}} great man who ever wrote me a letter was our guest--Oliver Wendell Holmes.

I had really stolen that dedication, almost word for word. I could not imagine how this curious thing had happened; for I knew one thing--that a certain amount of pride always goes along with a teaspoonful of brains, and that this pride protects a man from deliberately stealing other people's ideas. That is what a teaspoonful of brains will do for a man--and admirers had often told me I had nearly a basketful--though they were rather reserved as to the size of the basket.|$|R
