40|$|Background: The {{sensitivity}} of airport security screening measures has increased substantially {{during the past}} decade, but few reports have examined how this affects patients who have undergone hip arthroplasty. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the experiences of patients who had hip prostheses and who passed through airport security screenings. Methods: A consecutive series of 250 patients who presented to the office of a high-volume surgeon were asked whether they had had a hip prosthesis for at least one year and, if so, whether they had flown on a commercial airline within the past year. Patients who responded affirmatively to both questions were asked to complete a written survey that included questions about which joint(s) had been replaced, the number of encounters with airport security, the frequency and lo-cation of metal detector activation, any additional screening procedures that were utilized, whether security officials re-quested documentation regarding the prosthesis, the degree of inconvenience, and other relevant information. Results: Of the 143 patients with hip replacements who traveled by air, 120 (84 %) reported triggering the alarm and required <b>wanding</b> with a handheld detector. Twenty-five of these patients reported subsequently having to undergo further inspection, including additional <b>wanding,</b> being patted down, and in two cases having to undress in a private room to show the incision. Ninety-nine (69 %) of the 143 patients reported that the prosthetic joint caused an incon-venience while traveling.

40|$|Convergent {{evolution}} of modularity in metabolic networks through different community structures <b>Wanding</b> Zhou 1 * and Luay Nakhleh 2 * Background: It {{has been reported}} that the modularity of metabolic networks of bacteria is closely related to the variability of their living habitats. However, given the dependency of the modularity score on the community structure, it remains unknown whether organisms achieve certain modularity via similar or different community structures. Results: In this work, we studied the relationship between similarities in modularity scores and similarities in community structures of the metabolic networks of 1021 species. Both similarities are then compared against the genetic distances. We revisited the association between modularity and variability of the microbial living environments and extended the analysis to other aspects of their life style such as temperature and oxygen requirements. We also tested both topological and biological intuition of the community structures identified and investigated the extent of their conservation with respect to the taxomony. Conclusions: We find that similar modularities are realized by different community structures. We find that suc...|$|E
40|$|The Council Regulation (EC) No. 1099 / 2009 {{requires}} slaughterhouse {{managers to}} implement specific {{standard operating procedures}} for all pre-slaughter stages considered at risk, aimed at achieving adequate levels of animal welfare. This survey was aimed at testing the applicability to an abattoir for heavy pigs of an assessment system of animal welfare through animal-based measures. In the monitoring of handling operations, the number of animals fallen/slipped and prodded, and that of vocalising pigs were recorded. In the monitoring of the immobilisation stage, carried out on the same pigs, vocalisations were recorded {{at the entrance to}} the box and falls/slips occurring inside it. Animal welfare assessment during the stunning-sticking-bleeding steps, was carried out by recording the head-only electrical stunning basic parameters set by legislation, vocalisations resulting from hot <b>wanding,</b> and clinical signs of consciousness, sensibility and certain death. Except for immobilisation, the percentage of occurrence of these events above acceptability limits was detected in all other preslaughter steps. The most critical stages were: handling in the unloading area and along the single-file chute, stunning and especially bleeding, where 84. 13 % of animals showed one or more signs of consciousness and/or sensibility recovery. Wrong placement of electrodes observed in 53. 98 % of the animals, insufficient voltage and low amperage may explain why a high percentage of pigs recovered consciousness and/or sensibility before death. Some simple restructuring of unloading area, slowdown of slaughter line speed, increase of personnel involved in pre-slaughter management and regular calibration of the electrical stunning device could be effectively corrective measures aimed at raising the animal welfare level at the slaughterhouse under study...|$|E
40|$|At the 2003 2 ̆ 2 Rock the Vote 2 ̆ 2 debate, {{one of the}} {{questions}} posed by a student to the eight Democratic candidates for the presidential nomination was 2 ̆ 2 have you ever used marijuana? 2 ̆ 2 Amazingly, {{all but one of the}} candidates voluntarily answered the question. Add to this example the multiple ways in which we now see public intrusion into private lives (security cameras, electronic access to personal data, scanning and 2 ̆ 2 <b>wanding</b> 2 ̆ 2 at the airport) or private self-exposure in public forums (cell phones, web cams, confessional talk shows, voyeuristic 2 ̆ 2 reality 2 ̆ 2 TV). That matters so private could be treated as legitimate-in some cases even vital-for public discourse indicates how intertwined the realms of private and public have become in our era. Reverse examples exist as well. Around the world, public authorities look the other way while individual rights are abused [...] calling it a private matter [...] or officials appeal to sectarian morés to justify discrimination in public policies. The authors of The Private, the Public, and the Published feel that scholarship needs to explore and understand this phenomenon, and needs to address it in the college classroom. There are consequences of conflating public and private, they argue [...] consequences that have implications especially for what is known as the public good. The changing distinctions between 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 public, 2 ̆ 2 and the various practices of private and public expression, are explored in these essays with an eye toward what they teach us about those consequences and implications. Ultimately, the authors recommend a humane and ethical reconciling of the two realms in the tradition of rhetoric since Aristotle. This means, they argue, that scholars must work to create the conditions in public-in classrooms, meeting rooms, Congress, international forums [...] that respect and defend the ethical treatment of private lives.
