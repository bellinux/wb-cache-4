5|$|After 56 {{games with}} the Avalanche during the 2000–01 season, where he had 13 points, Miller was traded {{for the second time}} in his career. On February 21, 2001 Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings by the Colorado Avalanche <b>with</b> <b>Adam</b> Deadmarsh, a player later to be named (Jared Aulin, who would be traded on March 22, 2001) and Colorado's 1st round choices in the 2001 (Dave Steckel) and 2003 (Brian Boyle) Entry Drafts for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht.

5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner <b>with</b> <b>Adam</b> because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved in the writing of the songs later, particularly in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>Adam</b> Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
