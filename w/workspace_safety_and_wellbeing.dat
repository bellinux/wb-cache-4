The overarching objective of this integrated response was to create safer home environments for women and children affected by domestic violence. The response was run as a pilot project from January 2010 until December 2011 and received subsequent funding for continuation after the initial pilot period.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} based on a {{research}} project that examines if and how technologically mediated forms of surveillance and policing improve the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> of nightlife consumers whilst at the same time also contributing to processes of socio-spatial exclusion of particular groups. By interrogating the triad of surveillance <b>and</b> policing, <b>wellbeing</b> <b>and</b> exclusion in nightlife districts in Dutch city centers we found that the effects of video-surveillance on the production of space are complex and ambiguous. Storylines used by local policy-makers with regard to CCTV differ considerably between cities and tend to overestimate the benefits of CCTV surveillance. Moreover, consumers’ awareness and knowledge of CCTV tends to be limited and only a few experiences a real sense of enhanced <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>wellbeing</b> {{because of the presence of}} technology alone. At the same time, the effects of surveillance and policing on the exclusion of certain groups from nightlife districts are not equivocally supported by our initial findings either...|$|R

The survey also points to areas that require further investigation, including claims of derogatory language being used by some youth workers toward young people, and the high proportion of young people who report being subject to separation and restraint during their stay in detention. Young people’s responses to this survey have also highlighted opportunities to enhance the quality of care provided to young people in detention. These include increasing the use of video-conferencing technology to maintain regular family contact, introducing additional health checks-ups, and improving young people’s engagement in aftercare programs through a focus on practical elements like work, training, sport and social networking.

It also responds to new and emerging challenges for school communities such as cybersafety, cyberbullying and community concerns about young people and weapons.
