60|$|Eager {{to start}} certain {{improvements}} which should {{tend to make}} the house more nearly the kind of dwelling place I had promised myself it should become, hungry for the soil, rejoicing in the thought of once more planting and building, I took the train for the North with all my summer <b>ward-robe</b> and most of my manuscripts, with no intention of reëntering the city till October at the earliest.|$|E
60|$|But I {{have been}} {{describing}} Miss Rebecca {{as she was}} in former days only, for her appearance this evening, as she sits pasting on the green tickets, is in striking contrast with what it was {{three or four months}} ago. Her plain grey gingham dress and plain white collar could never have belonged to her <b>ward-robe</b> before that date; and though she is not reduced in size, and her brown hair will do nothing but hang in crisp ringlets down her large cheeks, there is a change in her air and expression which seems to shed a softened light over her person, and make her look like a peony in the shade, instead of the same flower flaunting in a parterre in the hot sunlight.|$|E
5000|$|Kubota {{incorporates}} guitar, piano, percussion, into {{a majority}} of his song and often writes about love, heartbreak, and the celebration and humor of life. He has cited several musicians as his inspirations, including Stevie Wonder, Sly Stone, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, and Donny Hathaway. Kubota's style is rooted in vintage soul music. He heavily incorporates classical piano and drums with R&B, soul, and pop music. He began experimenting with other genres, including reggae, go-go, psychedelic soul, funk, and rock music, in his latter albums, Kubojah: Parallel Word I, Bonga Wanga, Bumpin' Voyage, and Nothing But Your Love. Karen Hunter of New York Daily News stated [...] "He speaks with an accent, but sings in pure funk. Toshi Kubota, the Japanese soul sensation, blends the old sounds of Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder and even Luther Vandross with an up-to-date smoothed-out funk a la D'Angelo." [...] Time magazine states [...] "Kubota's favored '70s retro-glam <b>ward-robe</b> emphasizes {{the mood of the}} music he loves".|$|E

"As for you, you rich, your wealth has rotted, your fine <b>ward-robe</b> {{has grown}} moth eaten, your {{gold and silver}} have {{corroded}} and their corrosion is testimony against you; it will devour your flesh like fire. See what you have stored up for yourselves for the last days. Here, crying aloud, are the wages you withheld from the farmhands who harvested your fields. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of host. You have lived in wanton luxury on the earth; you have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. You condemned, and even killed the just man" [...] (James 5:1-6)… In 2 Corinthians 8-9 Paul simply says that the superfluity of some should compensate for the privation of others. When anyone is in need anyone who is not has superfluous goods. Paul was ignorant of economics or social engineering; but if there were those in dire need who were not helped, he knew the reason why help was refused {{and it was not}} the complexity of the problem.” The Civilization of Christianity, pages 83, 91.|$|E
