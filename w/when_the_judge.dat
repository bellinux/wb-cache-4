5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it {{made it hard to}} find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front of}} County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E
5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused {{about what is going}} on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E

The save was ultimately not used, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> decided not to save Faizal Isa, who was eliminated in 5th place. In retrospect, except for the Top 13 Results Show, where Gurmit explicitly asked <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> if they wanted to save Syltra Lee, the judges' save was hardly, if only briefly, mentioned.|$|R

5000|$|Ruth Rabbah is {{specially}} interesting from a cultural-historical {{point of}} view in that it endeavors to throw light on the habits and conditions of the time in which the incidents of the Book of Ruth took place. Thus, interpreting the very first words of the book, [...] "in <b>the</b> days <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> judged" [...] (Ruth i. 1), as [...] "in <b>the</b> days <b>when</b> <b>the</b> people <b>judged</b> their judges," [...] the author wishes to show that there was a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> perverted their judgments so that they were held responsible by <b>the</b> people. But <b>when</b> was there such a time, and who were those judges? According to Rab, <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> were Barak and Deborah; according to R. Huna, Deborah, Barak, and Jael; and according to Joshua b. Levi, Ehud and Shamgar.

25|$|The Crown Prosecution Service {{initially}} {{decided that}} there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against the officers but, following {{a review of the}} medical evidence, the officers were charged in March 2002 with Alder's manslaughter.

25|$|Dubuc {{was elected}} but the cabinet refused to {{recognize}} the results {{on the grounds that}} a proper election was never really held and returns were incomplete as polling stations were missed. A new election was called for February 15, 1906 instead. Dubuc challenged the calling of a new election in court. The case was lost <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> ruled that the courts have no jurisdiction in dealing with matters regarding elections and that responsibility is the purview of the Legislature.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} case {{occurred in}} October 2011 {{when the first}} person in Mali was prosecuted on allegations of slavery for exploiting Iddar Ag Ogazide. Temedt pressured for the case and provided financial assistance to Ag Ogazide's family during the difficult period. After a first hearing in which the accused claimed that he had paid Ag Ogazide for his work, the trial was delayed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> had to flee Gao for his safety. With the Tuareg Rebellion and the military coup, the case has been delayed further. The organization also pushes the government to further criminalize slavery and add additional sanctions against the practice and works with anti-slavery organizations in other countries and with Anti-Slavery International to coordinate efforts.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close and attentive to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E
50|$|In other cities, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> of <b>the</b> court went on circuit to {{outlying}} cities {{they would}} generally sit in courts in British consulate buildings but on occasions would use other premises where important cases of great public interest were being heard.|$|R

500|$|Idaho {{had been}} {{admitted}} to the Union earlier in 1890, and Boise, the state capital, was a boom town, where the police and courts were not yet fully effective.

Borah prospered in Boise, both in law and in politics, and in 1892 became head of the Republican State Central Committee. He served as political secretary to Governor William J.
