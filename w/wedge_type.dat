30|$|The {{connecting}} element {{is the key}} part to make steel supports yieldable. The steel support should maintain certain resistance force when it retracts, which can not only accommodate some rock deformation, but also restrain too large rock deformation to keep roadways stable. To meet the requirements mentioned above, the mechanical performance of the {{connecting element}} is very important. Any connecting element contains a lock unit and a friction unit. The lock unit binds the overlapping part of two segments in the support and offers compressive force. When the steel support overcomes the frictions between two segments of U-shaped steel and the connecting element, it will retract. According to the locking units, the connecting elements {{can be divided into}} bolt and <b>wedge</b> <b>types.</b> Bolt connecting elements can be subdivided into three types: a U-shaped bolt with clamping plate, double U-shaped clamping plates, and pushing bolt. Wedge connecting elements can also be subdivided into three types: wedge block (single-wedge or two-wedges), ear-shaped wedge, and buckled wedge.|$|R

40|$|In the {{visualization}} of the topology of second rank symmetric tensor {{fields in the}} plane one can extract some key points (degenerate points), and curves (separatrices) that characterize the qualitative behaviour of the whole tensor field. This can provide a global structure of the whole tensor field, and effectively reduce {{the complexity of the}} original data. To construct this global structure it is important to classify those degenerate points accurately. However, in existing visualization techniques, a degenerate point is only classified into two types: trisector and <b>wedge</b> <b>types.</b> In this work, we will apply the theory from the analysis of binary differential equations and demon-strate that, topologically, a simple degenerate point should be classified into three types: star (trisector), lemon and monstar.

40|$|The paper {{establishes}} the Himmerkinlahti Member, {{which is a}} thin metamor-phosed conglomerate-sandstone unit within the middle part of the early Proter-ozoic (Karelian) supracrustal sequence of the Kuusamo Belt, northern Finland.

40|$|The southwestern Barents Sea is an underexplored {{area of the}} Norwegian {{continental}} shelf, with a few {{discoveries in}} Triassic and Jurassic reservoirs. Recently drilled exploration wells on the Loppa High and the surrounding margins have encountered hydrocarbon bearing clastic wedges in Lower Cretaceous strata. Previous studies have proposed two different depositional environments for these wedges: 1) deep marine fans and, 2) shallow marine transition with tidal influence. Consequently, further studies are required for {{better understanding of the}} depositional environment and the reservoir properties of the wedges. This study focusses on reservoir characterization of the Lower Cretaceous clastic wedges along the southern margin of the Loppa High in the Hammerfest Basin. The main objectives of this study are: 1) to define the depositional environment using well logs and seismic data and, 2) to investigate the reservoir properties using rock physics diagnostic. The dataset includes nine wells and four 3 D seismic cubes which have been used to define the depositional environment of the wedges. Ten seismic facies (SF 1, SF 2 …SF 10) have been interpreted on the basis of seismic character and gamma-ray log response. Five <b>types</b> of the <b>wedges</b> (<b>Type</b> 1, Type 2 …Type 5) have been identified on the basis of seismic facies whereas Type 1 and 4 also have well logs to support the interpretation. Seismic derived attributes such as variance, chaos and sweetness reveal the lobate shape fan delta (<b>Type</b> 4 <b>wedge)</b> and fan shaped submarine fans (Type 3 and 5 wedges). Sweetness attribute differentiates the fan delta and submarine fans based on their sand and shale content which further delimit these depositional bodies. Depending upon the location of the wedges in the basin, the depositional environment ranges from transitional shallow marine to deep marine. The shallow marine environments include coastal/delta plain, fan delta, land slope aprons, and shelf canyons which are restricted to the narrow shelf (Type 1, 2 and 4 wedges). Whereas, submarine fans and slope fans (Type 3 and 5 wedges) are dominant in deep marine environments. Finally, rock physics analysis gives the reservoir properties from depositional (sorting) and diagenesis (cementation) points of view. <b>Type</b> 4 <b>wedges</b> (SF 1 and SF 4) on the narrow shelf are cemented and have porosity reduction mainly due to cementation and compaction (diagenesis effects). On the other hand, <b>Type</b> 1 <b>wedges</b> (SF 2, SF 3 and SF 5) are not cemented and reduction in porosity is mainly due to deteriorating sorting of the grains (depositional effects). The role of diagenesis increases moving from the east to the west along the margin of the Hammerfest Basin. Therefore, the wedges on the western side have a potential of being good quality reservoirs because of porosity preservation due to cementation and well sorting of the grains...|$|R

Also the ballistics were identical and both guns had a 56 caliber barrel. The KwK 36 was built to practically the same design as the 7.5 cm and 5.0 cm guns already used in German tanks, but with the structure scaled up considerably.

40|$|Abstract　To find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher recovery pressure, an experimental research {{is performed using}} devices with {{two different types of}} splitter. Devices with a <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct.

As compared with devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|E

40|$|The {{irregularity}} velocity patterns {{observed by}} the SABRE coherent radar at substorm expansion phase onset, which is identified by magnetometer observations of Pi 2 pulsations, are occasionally highly structured. In all {{the examples of}} structured velocity patterns examined, the SABRE viewing area is located at longitudes within the inferred substorm current <b>wedge.</b> Three <b>types</b> of structured velocity regime are apparent depending {{on the level of}} magnetic activity and the position of the radar viewing area relative to the substorm enhanced currents and the Pi 2 pulsation generation region. Firstly, vortex-like velocity patterns are observed and these may be caused by the field-aligned currents associated with the substorm current wedge. Secondly, regions of equatorward velocity are also observed at times of substorm expansion phase onset moving longitudinally across the SABRE viewing area. The longitudinal movement is usually westward although an example of eastward motion has been observed. The phase velocity of these regions of equatorward flow is typically 1 - 3 km s - 1. The observed equatorward velocities occur at the poleward edge or poleward of the background convection velocities observed by SABRE. These equatorward velocities {{may be related to the}} westward travelling surge and to the expansion (eastwards as well as westwards) of the brightening arc region at substorm onset. Thirdly, the flow rotates equatorward within the field of view but does not then appear to move longitudinally.
