5|$|Montcalm, before {{agreeing to}} these terms, {{tried to make}} sure that his Indian allies {{understood}} them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to move, a large number of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning.|$|E

He printed his own currency and established his own airline. This peace was shattered in May 1997, when he was betrayed by one of his generals, warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan, forcing him to flee from Mazar-i-Sharif as the Taliban <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to take the city.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the French <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to cross, {{according}} to detailed crossing plans drawn in advance by the Chief of Staff of the Grande Armée, Maréchal Berthier. Napoleon {{was aware that}} the Austrians had thrown earthworks between Aspern and Groß-Enzersdorf and planned to cross southeast of these positions and then outflank the enemy fortified line. This meant, however, that his forces had a much longer march before making contact with the enemy. On 4 July, by nightfall, {{under the cover of}} a violent thunderstorm that impeded any Austrian observation, Napoleon gave the order for the commencement of the crossing operations.|$|E
25|$|The villagers, who <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for {{a market}} day, at first did not panic or run away, {{and they were}} herded into the hamlet's commons. Harry Stanley, a machine gunner from Charlie Company, said during the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division's (CID) inquiry that the killings started without warning. He first {{observed}} a member of 1st Platoon strike a Vietnamese man with a bayonet. Then, the same trooper pushed another villager into a well and threw a grenade in the well. Next, he saw fifteen or twenty people, mainly women and children, kneeling around a temple with burning incense. They were praying and crying. They were all killed by shots in the head.|$|E
25|$|EBU had {{talks to}} Liechtenstein's only {{broadcaster}} 1FLTV (1 Fürstentum Liechtenstein Television) {{for them to}} join the EBU, and {{become a part of}} the Eurovision Song Contest. 1FLTV's programme director Peter Kolbel had confirmed interest in Liechtenstein's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest as soon as full EBU membership is granted, which may have happened in December 2009. Thus they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to debut in 2010, considering a national final concept similar to the German version of the Idol series – Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS). In November 1FLTV decided against applying for EBU membership in December for financial reasons, ruling out a debut in at the 2010 contest. The broadcaster will now look at other options for funding EBU membership in the future.|$|E

500|$|Tyutcheva was {{eventually}} fired. She took her story to {{other members of}} the family. While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on March 15, 1910 that she couldn't understand [...] "...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!)" ...|$|E

The group's road crew warned everyone to take precautions against any potential for drugs to be planted on them. Mitchell responded by wearing a suit without pockets and not wearing any underwear. Tour managers Gerry Stickells and Tony Ruffino expressed their concern to Hendrix {{and asked him if}} he had any drugs on him to which he replied: [...] "No." [...] After arriving in Toronto, he was awoken by concert promoter Ron Terry who told him: [...] "Whatever you got in that bag, get rid of it."

500|$|Architects {{including}} Thom Weeks and Jennifer Stanley led renovations of the Stanley into a live theatre. Weeks {{was initially}} {{disappointed with the}} state of the pre-renovated theatre, which looked [...] "pretty tired" [...] with its aged orange walls and sticky, soft drink-stained carpets. However, by the time the renovations were completed, and the actors and musicians <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to first perform in it, there was a general feeling of excitement about the theatre. Renovations included expansion of the lobby, reconfiguration of the balcony, an expansion of the stage to twice its original size, a new twenty-five metre fly tower from which to raise and lower scenery, new dressing rooms, a trap room, an electrical room and a green room backstage, a reduction of the number of seats from 1,216 to 650, a crush bar in the old projection booth, a section cut out of the theatre's dome to use for spotlights, and a full restoration of the theatre's gold-leafed plaster decorations. As a result of these renovations, in 1999 the theatre was awarded a City of Vancouver Heritage Award, as well as an IES International Illumination Design Award.|$|E
500|$|Tyutcheva {{took her}} book to {{other members of}} the family. Nicholas's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote in her diary on 15 March 1910 that she could not {{understand}} the family's regard for Rasputin as [...] "almost a saint" [...] when she viewed him as only a [...] "khlyst". Tyutcheva told Grand Duchess Xenia that the starets visited when Olga and Tatiana <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for bed and sat there talking with them and [...] "caressing" [...] them. The girls hid his presence from their governess and were afraid {{to talk to her about}} Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The empress refused to believe her, Vishnyakova told investigators, and said everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but [...] "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." [...] Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.|$|E
500|$|The Van Cortlandt family {{land was}} {{used during the}} American Revolution by both the Loyalists and Patriots, owing to James's {{leadership}} role {{early on in the}} revolution. On May 30, 1775, the New York Provincial Congress placed James on a committee to create a report on whether it was feasible to build a fort near his family's house. British General William Howe made the house his headquarters on November 13, 1776, thus placing it behind British-held ground. The Van Cortlandts wished to stay neutral in the war, however. [...] Later, the grounds were used by Patriot militia leaders Comte de Rochambeau, Marquis de Lafayette, and George Washington. The house itself was Washington's headquarters after his troops were defeated in the 1776 Battle of Long Island. That same year, Augustus Van Cortlandt hid city records under Vault Hill to protect them during the war, turning them over to the new American government after the war. It was in [...] "Indian Field," [...] at the present-day intersection of Van Cortlandt Park East and 233rd Street, that the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers, and 38 Indians from the militia were killed in 1778. [...] In 1781, Washington returned to the house to strategize with Rochambeau while their troops waited outside on what is now the Parade Ground and Vault Hill. He later lit campfires outside the house to deceive the British into thinking that his troops were still on the grounds. Washington used the house one final time in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris. The British had just withdrawn their troops from Manhattan, and Washington and George Clinton <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to enter the island, stopping over at the house before doing so.|$|E
