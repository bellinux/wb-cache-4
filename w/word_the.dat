5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable <b>word,</b> <b>the</b> first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable <b>word,</b> <b>the</b> second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable <b>word,</b> <b>the</b> first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.|$|E

5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles.

5|$|Belgrano and Saavedra, {{representing}} {{the military and}} the intellectuals, got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo, but without getting an answer. Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support, but they refused, under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy. Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request, and Cisneros finally accepted. A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his <b>word.</b> <b>The</b> open cabildo was held on 22 May, with all political leaders present, and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted a disruption, which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano. He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli, who made a speech explaining the concept of the retroversion of the sovereignty of the people, and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself. At the time of voting, Castelli's proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra, with Belgrano among its supporters. This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros {{and the creation of a}} government junta prevailed over the others. However, the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result, by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president. This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population. A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta. Belgrano was included in this junta, among many other local politicians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{hierarchical}} model incorporating motion patterns, proto symbols and <b>words</b> is proposed. <b>The</b> proto symbols abstract motion patterns, while <b>the</b> <b>words</b> {{are associated with}} the proto symbols stochastically. This paper describes the construction of a word space, where words are located in a multidimensional space based on dissimilarities among <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> dissimilarity between two words can be calculated by using association probabilities that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> generate motion proto symbols. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> space encapsulates relations among <b>the</b> <b>words</b> such as similar or dissimilar pairs of <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> <b>word</b> space also allows motion recognition based on <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> validity of <b>the</b> constructed <b>word</b> space is demonstrated on a motion capture database. Moreover, the addition of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> associations is found to change the conventional proto symbol space so that the discrimination among the proto symbols is improved. I...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Qur'an is whether their content and meaning were truly a divine revelation or they were revealed to the Prophet from God and then transferred into <b>the</b> form of <b>words.</b> In this regard, there are two perspectives. First, as all Muslims believe, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an {{are the result of}} a divine revelation, where­as the second viewpoint is that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an are written by a human and not God. According to this latter perspective, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an are sayings of the Prophet of which only the contents are based on a divine revelation. The theory of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an not being a divine revelation has been an abandoned and rejected one throughout the Islamic history. This is the reason it has not been the subject of any pertinent discussions. How can <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an be created by Muhammad or Gabriel even though it is believed that the Qur'an is a miracle? This article first defines the concept of revelation and then analyzes various viewpoints and opinions regarding this topic in order to conclude (with evidence) that the Qur'an is <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of <b>the</b> Prophet. If he had composed <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an and expressed the meaning of the revelation in his own <b>words,</b> then <b>the</b> Qur'an would not be <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God. In this case, the term 'word of God' indicates that the concept of the 'word' should be considered. Thus, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of <b>the</b> Qur'an are divine and they can be referred and attributed to God...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} brand names with English in Indonesian products are created. To {{analyze the data}} found the researchers applied English word formation in English morphology. This is a descriptive research. The data were brand names using English found in Indonesian product which were taken from three supermarkets in Solo namely Hypermart Solo Grand Mall, Hypermart Gorro Assalam, and Carefur from February up to April 2010. The research found that the brand names with English in Indonesian products can be created by applying word formation such as compounding, blending, affixation, reduplication, onomatopoeia, abbreviation, acronym and clipping. The process of compounding consists of pure compounding and modification compounding, The process of blending includes the first syllable of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> first syllable of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> first syllable of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> second syllable {{from the front of}} <b>the</b> second <b>words.,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> last syllables of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> two syllables from the front of <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> first syllable of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> two last syllables from the back of <b>the</b> second <b>words,</b> and <b>the</b> first <b>words</b> and <b>the</b> first syllables of <b>the</b> second <b>words.</b> <b>The</b> affixation process covers prefixes pro-, -bio and suffixes –y, - er, -ness, -ish, and –s.
