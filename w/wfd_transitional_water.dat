40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} of phytoplankton community assembly is a fundamental issue of aquatic ecology. Here, we use field data from transitional (e. g. coastal lagoons) and coastal water environments to decode patterns of phytoplankton size distribution into organization and adaptive mechanisms. <b>Transitional</b> <b>waters</b> are characterized by higher resource availability and shallower well-mixed water column than coastal marine environments. Differences in physico-chemical regime between the two environments have been hypothesized to exert contrasting selective pressures on phytoplankton cell morphology (size and shape). We tested the hypothesis focusing on resource availability (nutrients and light) and mixed layer depth as ecological axes that define ecological niches of phytoplankton. We report fundamental differences in size distributions of marine and freshwater diatoms, with <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> phytoplankton significantly smaller and with higher {{surface to volume ratio}} than marine species. Here, we hypothesize that mixing condition affecting size-dependent sinking may drive phytoplankton size and shape distributions.

40|$|On October 23 th 2000, the EU Water Framework Directive {{was finally}} adopted. The Directive was {{published}} in the Official Journal on December 22 th 2000 and entered into force the same day. The Water Framework Directive expands the scope of water protection of all waters and sets clear objectives that a 'good status' must be achieved for all European waters by 2015 and that water use must be sustainable throughout Europe. According to the Directive, the individual member states are obligated to describe ecological objectives orgoals for different waters. The aim of this project was to define ecological objectives for different biological quality elements for the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> In this document quality indices for benthos and phytoplankton have been presented. This document includes a study about the different approaches and methods used in Europe to define these ecological objectives. None of the existing indices was satisfactory and applicable on the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> neither forbenthos nor for phytoplankton. This {{has to do with the}} complexity of <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> systems. For the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> no temporal or spatial reference is available. The reference is therefore based on the available knowledge about the ecological functioning of estuaries. Concerning phytoplankton, separate indices have been established for the salt and fresh water zones of an estuary. For brackish water, a natural mortality zone for plankton, indices would be pointless. The scoring system for phytoplankton takes into account the trophic status (including the important element silica), the photic status and the danger of flushing. This scoring system has a simple design and determination of the coefficients requires minimal effort. After evaluation by specialists and comparison with other scoring systems, we can state that the proposed phytoplankton index is promising. Nevertheless the index needs testing, because the available data of the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> were used for its compilation. For benthos indices have been established for fresh water and for salt and brackish water together. These indices are derived from the marine index of Borja et al. (2000), which takes into account the response of species to organic load. For salt and brackish water the 'Borja'- index was combined with an index based on sensitivity/tolerance for current velocity. The 'Borja'-index and the proposed index were tested on the sediments of the Scheldt estuary. Although the proposed indices showed improvement in comparison with application of 'Borja', they, still are not fully satisfying. The lack of any score for absolute density - or biomass values proved to be a shortcoming. The sensitivity/tolerance of species to organic pollution needs to be further examined, especially for estuarine fresh water species. For macro-algae and angiosperms no indices have been established. At present the role of macro algae in the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> is nihil, and most probably this will not change in the future, so indices would be pointless. The only angiosperms occurring in the Flemish <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> are tidal flat vegetation, the discussion whether tidal flat vegetation must be incorporated in the quality index still exists...|$|R

This study aimed to remedy the weaknesses of the currently used EEI methodology in: (1) ecological status groups (ESG), (2) the formula, and (3) reference condition values. A cluster analysis of twelve species traits was used to delineate ESGs. Two main clusters (ESG I, late-successional; ESG II, opportunistic) were identified that were hierarchically divided into three and two sub-clusters, respectively: ESG I comprised thick perennial (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) coastal water species, and angiosperm plastic (IA), thick plastic (IB) and shade-adapted plastic (IC) <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> species.

Microbial hydrolysis rates correlated positively with POC and Chl-a, which increased along the eutrophication gradient.

40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or benthic invertebrates (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and phytobenthos (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches.

C 5 H 8 was most abundant in high-productivity <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> and eutrophic tropical waters. The chlorophyll-a normalized production rates of C 5 H 8 were high in the warm subtropical and tropical waters, suggesting the existence of a high emitter of C 5 H 8 in the biological community of the warm waters. High concentrations of the three VOIs in highly productive <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> were attributed to biological productions. For CH 3 I, the highest concentrations were widely distributed in the basin area of the oligotrophic subtropical NW Pacific, probably due to photochemical production and/or high emission rates from phytoplankton. In contrast, the lowest concentrations of C 2 H 5 I in subtropical waters were attributed to photochemical removal. Enhancement of CH 2 ClI concentrations in the shelf-slope areas of the Chukchi Sea and the <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> of the NW Pacific in winter suggested that vertical mixing with subsurface waters by regional upwelling or winter cooling acts to increase the CH 2 ClI concentrations in surface layer.

This thesis aim to investigate the range of validity for the linear Airy theory in shallow and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters.</b> The Airy theory is a simple and frequently used wave theory in coastal engineering to approximate the wave kinematics. To evaluate the Airy theory’s validity and accuracy in shallow and <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> depths, the theory is used to calculate the particle velocity 0. 5 meter above seabed in these water depths. Stokes 2 nd order wave theory is a non-linear expansion of the Airy theory and is also included in the calculations. The results from both wave theories are evaluated and compared with results from the numerical stream function theory. The results of the particle velocity calculations indicate significant differences between the Airy theory and the stream function theory for shallow and <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> depths. Stokes 2 nd order wave theory provides overall better results than the Airy theory in comparison with the results from the stream function theory, especially for the shallowest water depths included in the study. A research study of boundary layer effects close to the seabed is carried out in the thesis. Stokes oscillating boundary layer theory is described in detail and equations from the theory is derived with variable viscosity. Padé approximants are used to approximate the variable viscosity function. The results indicate that the boundary layer affects the velocity profile. The boundary layer thickness is shown to increase with increasing viscosity. In this thesis, only an introduction to sediment transport theory is carried out.

40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of the European Water Framework Directive has provoked enthusiastic debate between scientists and stakeholders, {{as they try to}} define the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of all water bodies, including estuaries (i. e., <b>transitional</b> <b>waters).</b> The issue is complex because estuarine environments are variable, due to fresh and marine water input and anthropogenic impacts. Benthic species and communities have adapted to tolerate temporal physico-chemical changes (e. g., salinity, substrata, depth, fine particles and a Maximum Turbidity Zone that is rich in organic matter). However, anthropogenization affects not only the water quality, but also estuarine surface size and navigation channel management. Though numerous bio-indicators and indices are used to define estuarine system EcoQS, very few of them were developed specifically for such variable anthropogenized systems comprising a variety of conditions. The critical question is: 'Is it possible to define an EcoQS for such specific modified and naturally stressed ecosystems?' Indicators must be chosen pragmatically so that they will be environmentally sustainable, economically viable, technologically feasible, socially desirable/tolerable, legally permissible and politically expedient. This contribution proposes an adaptation of the BOPA index, the Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index (BO 2 A), for use in the freshwater zones of <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> (i. e., up to the upper limit of tidal range).

In this framework, the socio-economic value of <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> and their role as natural heritage are particularly important. To improve our knowledge of the ecological status and ecosystem functioning of <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> investigations were carried out in Italian lagoons in the Po Delta and elsewhere (Marano-Grado, Goro, Comacchio, Pialassa Baiona, Lesina and Orbertello), applying the same procedures in accordance with National and International protocols.

Although the nutrient load was, on average, similar to that of other lagoons with better status, the overall conditions of Po Delta lagoons were found to be poor or bad, as highlighted by the absence of seagrasses and sensitive macroalgal species. Comparing all considered lagoons, the main factors affecting ecosystem recovery seem to be episodic high nutrient inputs, resulting from changes in river outflows, and huge sediment resuspensions caused by human activities. The studied transitional ecosystems displayed a wide range of conditions from bad to high, highlighting the possibility of ecosystem recovery especially by favouring nutrient regulation and angiosperm proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{ecological}} and economic importance, <b>Transitional</b> <b>Waters</b> (TW) have fallen behind {{all the other}} water categories in respect {{to the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and further, pose some interpretation problems in other existing Water Directives.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{recently}} described and interpreted the community {{structure and function}} of fishes inhabiting estuaries and other <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> in terms of categories or guilds. The latter describe the main features of the fishes' biology {{and the way in}} which they use an estuary. However, the approach has been developed by different workers in different geographical areas and with differing emphasis such that there is now a need to review the guilds proposed and used worldwide. The previous wide use of the guild approach has involved increasing overlap and/or confusion between different studies, which therefore increases the need for standardization while at the same time providing the opportunity to reconsider the types and their use worldwide. Against a conceptual model of the importance of the main features of fish use in estuaries and other <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> this review further develops the guild approach to community classification of fish communities inhabiting those areas. The approach increases the understanding of the use of estuaries by fishes, their interactions and connectivity with adjacent areas (the open sea, coastal zone and freshwater catchments) and the estuarine resources required by fishes. This paper gives a global perspective on this categorization by presenting new or refined definitions for the categories, lists the synonyms from the literature and illustrates the concepts using examples from geographical areas covering north and central America, north and southern Europe, central and southern Africa, Australia and the Indo-Pacific...|$|R
40|$|The Mondego estuary is a well-described {{polyhaline}} type of <b>transitional</b> <b>water</b> {{located at}} the North Atlantic Ocean Ecoregion, where cultural eutrophication progressed over the last decades of the 20 th century. Consequently, and due to huge productivity of Ulva spp. Zostera noltii meadows were severely reduced causing the whole ecosystem to become impoverished in terms of macrofaunal abundance, biomass and species richness with a concomitant lowering of secondary production. In 1998, experimental mitigation measures were implemented, via changes in hydrology to increase circulation and diversion of nutrient rich freshwater inflow, to reverse the process in the most affected area of the estuary - its south arm. Thus, the system quality status was assessed before and after 1998, over a ten year period. The OSPAR comprehensive procedure, {{the first phase of}} the US-NEEA procedure and the proposed EU-WFD physicochemical status criteria were applied to the data before and after the modifications and all show that the system health has improved. Nonetheless, the annual means of the oxidised forms of nitrogen and of phosphate were not reduced. In fact, applying criteria used in classifying the nutrient levels in <b>transitional</b> <b>waters</b> and the Baltic sea trophic condition, the system has not improved. Meaning that, to look forward to a "higher" quality status, future measures should also consider longer term solutions such as improved agriculture practices in the Mondego River valley through environmental friendly technological solutions that will reduce the nutrient loads to this system.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} the national classifications of good ecological status to be harmonised through an intercalibration exercise. In this exercise, {{significant differences in}} status classification among Member States are harmonized by comparing and, if necessary, adjusting the good status boundaries of the national assessment methods. Intercalibration is performed for rivers, lakes, coastal and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters,</b> focusing on selected types of water bodies (intercalibration types), anthropogenic pressures and Biological Quality Elements. Intercalibration exercises are carried out in Geographical Intercalibration Groups - larger geographical units including Member States with similar water body types - and followed the procedure described in the WFD Common Implementation Strategy Guidance document on the intercalibration process (European Commission, 2011). The Technical report on the Water Framework Directive intercalibration describes in detail how the intercalibration exercise {{has been carried out}} for the water categories and biological quality elements. The Technical report is organized in volumes according to the water category (rivers, lakes, coastal and <b>transitional</b> <b>waters),</b> Biological Quality Element and Geographical Intercalibration group. This volume addresses the intercalibration of the Lake Central-Baltic Fish ecological assessment methods. Part A: This document comprises an overview and detailed descriptions of fish-based lake ecological assessment methods. Part B describes the construction of multiple pressure index in the Central-Baltic region. Part C describes the procedure and results of the boundary harmonisation of national fish-based lake assessment systemsJRC. D. 2 -Water and Marine Resource...|$|R
