5|$|Pensford Colliery, {{which opened}} in 1909, had the latest {{equipment}} at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, pithead baths and a coal <b>washery.</b> Faulting made coal production expensive and it closed in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a <b>washery</b> at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|The two establishments were {{constructed}} in South East Northumberland {{as part of}} an incentive to lower the high unemployment numbers. The site was also chosen because of the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries. Ellington Colliery sunk in 1909, with Lynemouth Colliery sinking 18 years later. However, in 1968, the two collieries were connected underground by the Bewick Drift, from which coal was brought to the surface. The Drift had no rail connection, and so coal was sent to the <b>washery</b> at Lynemouth by conveyor belt. The power station was constructed nearby the end of the conveyor belt.|$|E
30|$|The {{demand of}} coal {{increased}} {{with the growth}} of Steel Industry. Keeping this in view, Coal India has planned to install six new coking coal <b>washeries</b> in BCCL with design capacity of 18.6 MTPY. These <b>washeries</b> will be installed and run on BOM scheme (Build Operate and Maintain). Three of these <b>washeries</b> are under construction. Five stage of Washing is being introduced in India with these <b>washeries</b> (Sarkar et al. 2015; Saxena 2015).|$|R
30|$|Out of these, six are {{coking coal}} <b>washeries,</b> under the {{ownership}} of Bharat Coking Coal Limited with total design capacity of 18.6 MTY; and the remaining nine <b>Washeries</b> are Non-Coking Coal <b>Washeries</b> with total designed capacity of 74.5 MTY under {{the ownership of}} CCL (03 No— 19.5 MTY), SECL (02 No— 15 MTY) and MCL (04 No— 40 MTY) subsidiaries of Coal India Limited (Saxena 2015; Sarkar et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|Over the period, {{quality of}} coal has {{deteriorated}} due to exhaustion of superior grade coal in upper seams of BCCL and CCL Coal Belt (Sarkar et al. 2015). However, {{there has not}} been significant development in coal washing circuits, as the most recent <b>washeries</b> (Kedla and Madhuband) are Batac Jig-based <b>washeries</b> in contrast with the earliest coal <b>washeries</b> of HSL, which comprised of Heavy Media Separators (Rai and Tiwari 2009).|$|R
5|$|Spring Brook {{provided}} {{power for}} early lumbering in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} watershed of Spring Brook included coal mining and agriculture. The Pennsylvania Coal Company historically had a <b>washery</b> that discharged into the stream. The Du Pont Powder Company also operated in the watershed at that time. A railroad line along the stream was present by the 1880s. The Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad also crossed the stream's watershed and the Scranton and Spring Brook Railroad followed the stream between Rockdale and its mouth. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Moosic, which had a population of 3964 at the time. The main stem and several tributaries were also historically used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. The stream is still used as an important water supply in the Lackawanna Valley, as of 2001. Together with Roaring Brook and Stafford Meadow Brook, {{it serves as a}} water supply to a substantial part of the valley. Some areas of the watershed have been subjected to extensive timbering programs as recently as 2001. The Nesbitt Water Filtration Plant is in the watershed, in Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It is owned by the Pennsylvania American Water Company.|$|E

25|$|By 1970 it was {{the coal}} <b>washery</b> at Onllwyn that {{sustained}} {{that portion of the}} line, but between 1970 and 1977 there was some limestone traffic from Craig-y-nos.|$|E
30|$|After a decade, for {{administrative}} reasons, ownership of SAIL <b>Washeries</b> {{was transferred to}} Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL). To cater for the growing demand of clean coal, Coal India commissioned seven more coking coal <b>Washeries</b> (Sudamdih, Moonidih, Nandan, Barora, Mohuda, Kedla and Madhuband) during 1980 – 2000 (Ministry of Coal 2014; Sen 2015; Sinha 1988; Saxena 2015; NSO 2015). The most recent ones are Kedla and Madhuband <b>Washeries</b> of CCL and BCCL commissioned in 1997 and 1998 respectively.|$|R
30|$|These new <b>washeries</b> {{have been}} {{facilitated}} with re-washing circuit for the middling produced in their primary circuit; and MoU {{has already been}} signed for utilization of rejects produced in these <b>washeries</b> in FBC Power Plants and allied industries (Minutes of IMC Meeting).|$|R
30|$|As {{evident from}} Table  4 and Fig.  2, present {{capacity}} utilization of existing <b>washeries</b> of BCCL is around 20  %. Study is {{being carried out}} by the authors for improving techno-economic performance of the <b>washeries.</b> Once the coal washing becomes a profitable proposition, BCCL management will be encouraged to revive the existing <b>washeries</b> for maximum capacity utilization with the objective of washing entire coking coal produced in BCCL. The other companies are expected to follow this and thus ensure utilization of Indigenous Coking Coal with no or substantial reduction in import.|$|R

30|$|Coal Washing Exploration in India {{dates back}} to 1900 s; though, first coking coal <b>washeries</b> in India were {{installed}} after independence. At present, most of the coking coal <b>washeries</b> are owned by Public Sector Companies; whereas, most of the non-coking coal <b>washeries</b> are owned by Private Sector. Even after six decades of coal washing practices, {{there has not been}} significant development in the coal washing intelligentsia. Indian Coal Washing industry is still dependent on imported equipment, which has been designed to treat coal that is significantly different from Indian coal of drift origin. In this paper, authors have ventured into evolution of Indian Coal Washing Industry (with a focus on coking coal washing sector), its present condition and future prospect for growth. The paper emphasizes need for developing indigenous solutions to industrial challenges and highlights importance of increased coordination among academia-research institutions and coal industry.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{attractiveness}} of Coal Washing Industry in India is high, but also full of challenges. PESTEL analysis of coal washing industry suggests that India is heading towards mandatory coal washing before end utilization. The deteriorating quality of raw coking coal poses challenges before {{the scientific community}} and the industry to find out simple and economically viable coal washing scheme for maximum recovery of coking coal for usage in metallurgical sector. There also lies scope for analyzing present condition of existing <b>washeries,</b> especially in public sector, to look for innovative techniques for revival of these <b>washeries.</b>|$|R
30|$|Coal Washing Technology {{has evolved}} globally. Some {{countries}} have almost frozen their washing technology {{for a particular}} coal seam. This {{is not the case}} with Indian coal industry. The Washing Technology developed elsewhere, have been slightly customized to face the challenges of difficult washing characteristics of Indian Coal. As such, no washing equipment has been designed specifically to treat Indian Coal with difficult washing characteristics, which is not encountered in case of carboniferous coal. Details of washing schemes in existing coking coal <b>washeries</b> of India has been compiled in Table  4 (Sen 2015; Ministry of Coal 2014; Chakraborty et al. 2015; Sarkar et al. 2015; CCL 2012; Rai and Tiwari 2009). Heavy Media Cyclone is the most widely used separator in these <b>washeries.</b> Presence of high proportion of near-gravity-material (NGM) mandates cyclone washing (Rai and Tiwari 2009). Misplacement of coal in such washing schemes can be further improved with the aid of automation and control. However, most of the public sector <b>washeries</b> are yet to integrate automation and control in their existing circuits.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 {{they had}} 16 {{underground}} pumps, {{and the average}} amount of water pumped out of the mine in a 24-hour period was 542,000 gallons (2.46 million liters), this water was pumped into a pond {{on the surface and}} the water re-pumped to the boilers and <b>washeries.</b>|$|R
