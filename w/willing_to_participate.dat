5|$|For much of {{its first}} century, {{enrollment}} at Texas A was restricted to white men who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. During this time, {{a limited number of}} women were allowed to attend classes but forbidden from gaining a degree. During World War I, 49% of A graduates were in military service, and in 1918, the senior class was mustered into military service to fight in France. During World War II, Texas A produced over 20,000 combat troops, contributing more officers than both the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy combined.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, France, Britain and the United States unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to reach an}} agreement with the Soviet Union for a plan envisioning an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate,</b> including the Soviet Union. Under the plan, which President Harry S. Truman signed on 3 April 1948, the US government gave to Western European countries over $13 billion (equivalent to $189.39 billion in 2016) to rebuild the economy of Europe. Later, the program {{led to the creation of}} the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the artists}} conferred in New York and responded in a joint letter {{that they would be}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate,</b> but not on the terms set. They {{proposed}} a competition with set fees for sketches and designs submitted by the invited artists, to be judged by a jury of their peers, and with the Mint committed to replace the Seated Liberty coins with the result. They also insisted that the same artist create both sides of a given coin, and that more time be given to allow the development of designs. Leech was unable to meet these terms, as there was only enough money available for the single prize. In addition to inviting the ten artists, he had sent thousands of solicitations through the country; a number of designs were submitted in response to the circulars. To judge the submissions, he appointed a jury consisting of Saint-Gaudens, Barber, and Henry Mitchell, a Boston seal engraver and member of the 1890 Assay Commission. The committee met in June 1891 and quickly rejected all entries.|$|E
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in the plot, to {{distract}} Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference {{with him after}} school. Since Susan {{is one of his}} better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

25|$|Nevada State Prison {{had been}} the state-designated {{facility}} for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich {{did not want to}} be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in a firing squad.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss began active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided her linguistic abilities had advanced {{to the point where}} they would yield usable results. Their tests measured both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology, and Curtiss conducted the primary analysis of the results. At first the tests were deliberately short, only looking for six to eight responses per test, and over the course of testing they gradually increased in duration. When Curtiss began testing Genie usually did not actively resist but never initiated tests and only did the absolute least amount required, which Curtiss attributed to Genie simply being lazy, making the first year of testing extremely difficult. As Curtiss continued Genie grew to largely enjoy being tested and was typically much more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate,</b> though she still usually continued to less than she was capable of and sometimes playfully gave deliberately wrong answers, and on some occasions would even indicate that she wanted to take the tests.|$|E
50|$|The term 'maenads' also {{refers to}} women in the mythology who {{resisted}} the worship of Dionysus, and were therefore driven mad by him, forced against their <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in often horrific rites.

25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more flexibly. By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E
25|$|Less {{is usually}} {{known about the}} {{pressures}} models in the industry face, but striving hard {{to meet the requirements}} of their agency or brand is a main facet. Among the group, 69% were told to tone up, while 62% cited that their agencies required them to lose weight or change their body shape. Another 54% of models; however, revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply.  Hence, models habitually weigh themselves under the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) level. A study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, discovered that a majority of models had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.41, which qualifies for anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6-8 to 0-2. The average weight of a typical model in the United States was also recorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average woman in society. This phenomenon has caused countless of models to suffer from illness such as eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. In extreme cases, some models have died due to complications caused by eating disorders. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely death of two models; Luisel Ramos, and Ana Carolina Reston. Both girls suffered complications from their eating disorders, and were severely underweight. Owing to the intensifying burdens, an high number of models are therefore <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> in intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting.|$|E
