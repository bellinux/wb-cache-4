To detect the danger of aqua-planning measurements of precipitation intensity and <b>waterfilm</b> thickness {{as well as the}} status of the road surface are needed. To detect these atmospheric data different weather sensors are located near the motorway. There are two different sensor systems available which detect these measurements at the moment. For the detection of the status of the road surface, like dry, moist or wet, the sensor is imbedded directly in the road surface in most cases. The other sensor system is non-invasive which can be installed next to or over the road. Nowadays more and more open-pored asphalt is used because of its advantage to be less noisy and its property to drain off water better than normal asphalt. But this kind of asphalt cannot be cut to install a road sensor therefore the usage of non-invasive sensors will be increase in the future. This may also lead to different thresholds in automatic traffic control during adverse weather situations. The measurements of <b>waterfilm</b> thickness, road surface and road temperature are very important for automatic traffic control algorithms [2] as a speed limit caused by rain is derived and shown on variable message signs. In the German Technical Bulletin [2] a matrix with the two measurements precipitation intensity and water film thickness define which wetness-level is detected. There are 5 wetness-levels which cause different speed limits. For the first supply thresholds are given based on the experiences with road sensors. For the newer non-invasive sensors other thresholds may be necessary. This paper will show some possible thresholds for the precipitation/waterfilm thickness matrix and their effects on the speed limits shown on the variable massage signs. Within the German Test Site for Road Weather Stations [1] various road sensors as well as various non-invasive sensors are installed. The data for both detection technologies has been collected for the last 2 years and allows a statistically valid comparison of them. In this paper the advantage and disadvantage of the two sensor technologies will be shown for the measurements <b>waterfilm</b> thickness, road surface and road temperature. In order to describe the behavior of the sensors, the available data will be analyzed concerning the availability of valid datasets and the accuracy. Additionally the performance of the sensors is examined during periods of different clusters of traffic volumes...|$|E
40|$|In {{their early}} stages, {{meniscus}} midges are truly {{inhabitants of the}} <b>waterfilm,</b> {{in a variety of}} habitats from still to flowing water. Larvae dislodged into the water from their usual inverted-U-shaped position in the film drawn up around emergent leaves and stems, carry a bubble of air between their infolded bristle-fringed posterior paddles and soon surface again; they may make S-shaped curves {{across the surface of the}} water before taking up position in the meniscus again. The pupa also lies in the water-film drawn up by some emergent substratum, receiving air through two characteristic respiratory trumpets, and remaining motionless unless disturbed. Stillness is in fact a feature of this Family of non-biting midges, and the adults, especially the females, stand for hours in a vertical position, head up, motionless or slowly waving the third pair of long legs. A unique type of semaphore, however, is demonstrated by both males and females of one species of Dixella, by rapid, or sometimes more prolonged, wing flexes in which two, three or more individuals may take part in turn...|$|E
40|$|This study compares and {{contrasts}} the travertine depositional facies {{of two of}} {{the largest}} sites of travertine formation, located in very different geological contexts, i. e. the modern Mammoth Hot Spring (MHS) system in the active volcanic complex of Yellowstone National Park (USA) and the Pleistocene Cakmak quarry, a well-exposed example of the Ballık travertines in the extensional Denizli Basin (Turkey). New, 2 D to 3 D facies maps of both travertine systems, combined with microscopy, assist in proposing an integrated spring depositional model, based on the existing MHS facies model, understanding general controls on meter to kilometer scale travertine deposit architecture and its preservation, and provide quantitative estimates of facies spatial coverage and slope using GIS. The comparison resulted in the distinction of eight facies, grouped in five downstream facies zones from Vent to Distal Slope. Notwithstanding the different geological context of both travertine systems, observations show that several of the facies are strikingly comparable (draping Apron and Channel Facies, top-slope Pond Facies, crystalline Proximal Slope Facies and Distal Slope Facies), whereas other facies do not have a precise, exposed equivalent (Vent Facies, pavement Apron and Channel Facies, extended Pond facies and phyto Proximal Slope Facies). Combining observations of active springs at MHS with the Cakmak vertical travertine quarry exposures demonstrates that lateral and vertical facies transitions are a sensitive record of changes in the spring dynamics (flow intensity and paths) that become well-preserved in the geological record, and can be recognized as prograding, aggrading, retrograding trends or erosive surfaces, traceable over tens to hundreds of meters. Quantification of facies specific coverage at MHS shows that Proximal and Distal Slope Facies deposits cover as much as ∼ 90 % of the total mapped surface area. In addition, only ∼ 7 % of the surface is found to be marked by a <b>waterfilm</b> related to an active flowing spring. Slope statistics reveal that strong slope breaks can often be related to transgressive Apron and Channel Facies belts and that variable, but steep slopes (up to 40 °) are dominated by Proximal Slope Facies, in agreement with the Cakmak exposures. Integrating travertine facies and architecture of deposits formed in distinct geological contexts can improve the prediction of general spring facies distributions and controls in other, modern and ancient, subsurface travertine systems...|$|E
