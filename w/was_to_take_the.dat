5|$|Armada of the Damned was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of the Damned was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E
5|$|Godley {{was named}} as {{commander}} of I ANZAC Corps {{which included the}} original AIF divisions, the 1st and 2nd Divisions, and the newly formed New Zealand Division. These divisions were engaged in defensive duties along the Suez Canal. However, following the German attack at Verdun in February, {{it was decided that}} the planned move of I ANZAC Corps to the Western Front be expedited. Birdwood <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> corps to France, and on 28 March 1916, he exchanged commands with Godley, who took over II ANZAC Corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters {{to act as}} night fighters without radar was largely {{unsuccessful}} in intercepting German bombers during The Blitz; Johnson's only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson's squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was eager to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the Wing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> fight to them.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was split}} into two parts. The first group, composed of around eight hundred colonial troops and led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> main road towards Rejaf and engage the rebels openly. The second, under Belgian war hero Baron Dhanis, was a much larger force of over three-thousand men, mostly natives from the Tetela ethnic group, and was to take a treacherous path through the jungle to the north. Both expeditions left for the Lado Enclave in December 1896.|$|E
5|$|With the VT Commodore of 1997, Holden {{looked again}} to Opel in Germany for a donor platform. The {{proposal}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle's width and mechanical setup for local conditions. In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, {{save for the}} engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT bodywork spawned {{a new generation of}} Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the autonomy of Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E

5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E
5|$|On 14 and 15 July 1942, {{during the}} First Battle of El Alamein, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} what would {{be known as the}} Battle of Ruweisat Ridge. Ruweisat Ridge was held by the enemy and was in the centre of the El Alamein line, dominating the surrounding area. The 4th Brigade <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> western end of the ridge, with Kippenberger's 5th Brigade tasked with the capture of the centre of the ridge. The 5th Indian Brigade was allocated to deal with the eastern end. British tanks, in the form of two armoured brigades, were to protect the flanks and be in support to deal with the expected counterattack. However, little thought was given to communication and liaison between the infantry and armoured brigades, nor was a clear chain of command established. This would have implications for the outcome of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E

5|$|Though an {{absentee}} landlord, Leicester, who {{was also}} Baron of Denbigh, regarded the lordship {{as an integral part}} of a territorial base for a revived House of Dudley. He set about developing the town of Denbigh with large building projects; the church he planned, though, was never finished, being too ambitious. It would not only have been the largest, but also the first post-Reformation church in England and Wales built according to a plan where the preacher <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> centre instead of the altar, thus stressing the importance of preaching in the Protestant Church. In vain Leicester tried to have the nearby episcopal see of St. Asaph transferred to Denbigh. He also encouraged and supported the translation of the Bible and the Common Prayer Book into Welsh.|$|E
5|$|With {{his three}} {{divisions}} reunited on 7 September 1812, Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps saw {{action at the}} Battle of Borodino. He {{was placed on the}} French right, in second line, behind the Corps of Marshal Davout and, after Murat managed to take two of the redoubts on the Russian left, Nansouty placed his men on the right of this position and then supported the advance of {{the right wing of the}} army. With the Russians making an offensive comeback, Nansouty placed himself at the head of the heavy divisions of Saint-Germain and Valence and charged and while doing so a bullet pierced one of his knees. This was Nansouty's first battle wound and it was serious enough to end his active role during this campaign. He was transported to Moscow following the battle and although still wounded, on 10 October, he was entrusted with the mission of commanding the convoy that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> wounded generals and colonels, as well as the main trophies captured, behind the lines. During this mission, he was exposed to great danger, to famine and extreme cold, which impacted his already frail health. He was then allowed to return to France and recover from his injury.|$|E
