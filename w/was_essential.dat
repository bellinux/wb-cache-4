5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E

Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> {{to the process}} of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> {{for the county}} or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E

Here {{we show that}} the Forkhead transcription factor FoxM 1 regulates expression of many G 2 -specific genes and <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for chromosome stability. Loss of FoxM 1 leads to pleiotropic cell-cycle defects, including a delay in G 2, chromosome mis-segregation and frequent failure of cytokinesis. We show that transcriptional activation of cyclin B by FoxM 1 <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for timely mitotic entry, whereas CENP-F, another direct target of FoxM 1 identified here, <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for precise functioning of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Thus, our data uncover a transcriptional cluster regulated by FoxM 1 that <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> for proper mitotic progression. ...|$|R
