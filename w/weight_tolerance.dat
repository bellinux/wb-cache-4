50|$|Along {{with the}} main {{problems}} constant alterations to other components were needed as the Army changed requirements and as updated components from external suppliers replaced those already in use.

As a result, the first production B-29s that rolled off the lines at Wichita were virtually hand built.

40|$|The {{trucking}} {{industry has}} {{played a significant role}} in the economic growth in Texas by transporting and distributing commodities using commercial motor vehicles. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), however, has recognized that the large number of overweight trucks operating on the state highway system has resulted in the deterioration of pavement condition. In addition, the permit fee to carry higher loads above legal limits is much lower than the cost to treat the increase in pavement damage. The primary purpose of the research presented in this paper is to investigate current TxDOT overweight permit structures to support pavement management. The research team analyzed the TxDOT “ 1547 ” Over-axle <b>Weight</b> <b>Tolerance</b> Permit structure to support an increase in the fee structure, bringing it more in line with the actual pavement damage. The analysis showed that the revised overweight permit structure could provide an additional $ 9. 3 million annually for pavement maintenance needs by increasing current permit fees. These results were supported by the 2030 Committee for recommendation to the Texas Transportation Commission and consideration by the State Legislature [1].

40|$|BACKGROUND: Insulin {{sensitivity}} and insulin secretion are traits {{that are both}} genetically and environmentally determined. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the distribution of the insulin sensitivity index (Si), the acute insulin response, and glucose effectiveness (Sg) in young healthy Caucasians and to estimate the relative impact of anthropometric and environmental determinants on these variables. METHODS: The material included 380 unrelated Caucasian subjects (18 - 32 yr) with measurement of Si, Sg and insulin secretion during a combined intravenous glucose (0. 3 grams/kg body weight) and tolbutamide (3 mg/kg body <b>weight)</b> <b>tolerance</b> test. RESULTS: The distributions of Si and acute insulin response were skewed to the right, whereas the distribution of Sg was Gaussian distributed. Sg was 15 % higher in women compared with men (P < 0. 001). Waist circumference, body mass index, maximal aerobic capacity, and women's use of oral contraceptives were the most important determinants of Si. Approximately one-third of the variation of Si could be explained by these factors. Compared with individuals in the upper four-fifths of the distribution of Si, subjects with Si in the lowest fifth had higher waist circumference, higher blood pressure, lower VO 2 max, and lower glucose tolerance and fasting dyslipidemia and dysfibrinolysis. Only 10 % of the variation in acute insulin response could be explained by measured determinants. CONCLUSION: Estimates of body fat, maximal aerobic capacity, and women's use of oral contraceptives explain about one-third of the variation in Si in a population-based sample of young healthy Caucasians...|$|E

Modifications to needle-like crystalline PETN explosive powders to make them pourable were introduced by the application of about 80 A thick polymeric coatings to the individual crystals, followed by a controlled agglomeration into a spherical prill. Microencapsulation techniques provided the key to achieving the result using less than 0. 5 wt. % coating (an order of magnitude less coating than in usual PBX systems). These coatings did not appreciably alter the energy required to initiate and significantly increased the strength of the pellets.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if these changes were reversible with glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), a peptide that we have previously shown could increase insulin mRNA and total insulin content in insulinoma cells. We infused 1. 5 pmol/ kg- 1. min- 1 GLP- 1 subcutaneously using ALZET microosmotic pumps into 22 -mo-old Wistar rats for 48 h. Rat infused with either GLP- 1 or saline were then subjected to an intraperitoneal glucose (1 g/kg body <b>weight)</b> <b>tolerance</b> test, 2 h after removing the pump. 15 min after the intraperitoneal glucose, GLP- 1 -treated animals had lower plasma glucose levels (9. 04 +/- 0. 92 mmol/liter, P < 0. 01) than saline-treated animals (11. 61 +/- 0. 23 mmol/liter). At 30 min the plasma glucose was still lower in the GLP- 1 -treated animals (8. 61 +/- 0. 39 mmol/liter, P < 0. 05) than saline-treated animals (10. 36 +/- 0. 43 mmol/liter). This decrease in glucose levels was reflected in the higher insulin levels attained in the GLP- 1 -treated animals (936 +/- 163 pmol/liter vs. 395 +/- 51 pmol/liter, GLP- 1 vs. saline, respectively, P < 0. 01), detected 15 min after glucose injection. GLP- 1 treatment also increased pancreatic insulin, GLUT 2, and glucokinase mRNA in the old rats. The effects of GLP- 1 were abolished by simultaneous infusion of exendin [9 - 39], a specific antagonist of GLP- 1. GLP- 1 is therefore able to reverse some of the known defects that arise in the beta cell of the pancreas of Wistar rats, not only by increasing insulin secretion but also by inducing significant changes at the molecular level...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study is to determine if these facilities are making the nec-essary changes to accommodate obese patients. Data were collected from 20 sonography facili-ties regarding the size of patient gowns, blood pressure cuffs, and size and weight tolerances of examination tables and waiting room chairs.

Key words: sonography, obesity, health care fa-cilities “Obesity is a chronic condition characterized by an excess of body fat. ” 1 It can be defined as being more than 45 % above ideal body weight (IBW) for women and more than 35 % above IBW for men. 2 Approximately one-third of all US adults are obese. 3 Obese individuals face a higher percentage of health issues than those of normal-weight indi-viduals, resulting in what may be an increased number of visits to health care facilities.

40|$|Background: Molecular {{markers and}} {{knowledge}} of traits associated with heat tolerance are likely to provide breeders with a more efficient means of selecting wheat varieties able to maintain grain size after heat waves during early grain filling. Results: A population of 144 doubled haploids derived from a cross between the Australian wheat varieties Drysdale and Waagan was mapped using the wheat Illumina iSelect 9, 000 feature single nucleotide polymorphism marker array and used to detect quantitative trait loci for heat tolerance of final single grain weight and related traits. Plants were subjected to a 3 d heat treatment (37  °C/ 27  °C day/night) in a growth chamber at 10 d after anthesis and trait responses calculated by comparison to untreated control plants. A locus for single grain weight stability was detected on the short arm of chromosome 3 B in both winter- and autumn-sown experiments, determining up to 2. 5  mg difference in heat-induced single grain weight loss. In one of the experiments, a locus with a weaker effect on grain weight stability was detected on chromosome 6 B. Among the traits measured, the rate of flag leaf chlorophyll loss {{over the course of}} the heat treatment and reduction in shoot weight due to heat were indicators of loci with significant grain <b>weight</b> <b>tolerance</b> effects, with alleles for grain weight stability also conferring stability of chlorophyll ('stay-green') and shoot weight. Chlorophyll loss during the treatment, requiring only two non-destructive readings to be taken, directly before and after a heat event, may prove convenient for identifying heat tolerant germplasm. These results were consistent with grain filling being limited by assimilate supply from the heat-damaged photosynthetic apparatus, or alternatively, accelerated maturation in the grains that was correlated with leaf senescence responses merely due to common genetic control of senescence responses in the two organs. There was no evidence for a role of mobilized stem reserves (water soluble carbohydrates) in determining grain weight responses. Conclusions: Molecular markers for the 3 B or 6 B loci, or the facile measurement of chlorophyll loss over the heat treatment, could be used to assist identification of heat tolerant genotypes for breeding.
