5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E

40|$|Conference Theme: Connecting Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning to Policy and PracticeTeachers {{implementing}} new curricula {{targeting the}} development of 21 st century skills {{face the challenge of}} learning how to design learning experiences that align with the intended pedagogical approach. Curriculum reform initiatives expect that development <b>will</b> <b>take</b> place <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in part through teacher collaboration and sharing of curriculum resources through digital repositories. However, curriculum artifacts have not so far proved to be an effective medium for teacher collaboration. This paper argues that the teaching profession suffers from not having a shared professional language to describe and communicate their design ideas, and demonstrates that the provision of a design language and format that highlights the multilevel, multi-faceted aspects of a design helps to scaffold teacher discourse to deeper pedagogical discussions. On the basis of the findings from a cross-cultural collaboration, we set out the implications for computer-supported collaborative learning for teachers, to enable more effective teacher learning and collaboration. © ISLS. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
