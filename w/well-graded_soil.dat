40|$|Recent {{experiments}} into characterisation of {{the loading}} resulting from detonation of a shallow buried explosive have highlighted the complex underlying physical mechanisms {{present at the}} face of a target situated above the soil surface. This paper presents the results from such experiments, where the localised blast pressure and impulse is measured using an array of Hopkinson pressure bars at specific points on the target surface. Two different soil types are tested; a relatively uniform sand, and well-graded sandy-gravel. It is observed that the variability in localised loading is intrinsically linked to the particle size distribution of the soil medium; the uniform soil produces repeatable data with little variation whereas the <b>well-graded</b> <b>soil</b> demonstrates considerable spread. The cause of this spread is quantified and discussed with reference to the distinct loading mechanisms acting on the target as seen in the experimental data...|$|E
50|$|Compaction can be {{generally}} {{defined as the}} densification of soil by the removal of air and rearrangement of soil particles through the addition of mechanical energy. The energy exerted by compaction forces the soil to fill available voids, and the additional frictional forces between the soil particles improves the mechanical properties of the soil. Because {{a wide range of}} particles are needed in order to fill all available voids, <b>well-graded</b> <b>soils</b> tend to compact better than poorly graded soils.|$|R

40|$|Adding {{discrete}} fibers to soils {{can improve}} their strength; however, fiber reinforcement remains scarce in practice. Previous {{studies on the}} performance of soils reinforced with discrete fibers consist mainly of laboratory studies with either clay or, most often, uniform sand as the host soil, so {{there is a lack of}} data on other types of soils such as weathered soils, which tend to be well graded. Unlike uniform soils, which are generally dilative, <b>well-graded</b> <b>soils</b> usually show a contractive behavior. This study examines the effect of adding fibers to a completely decomposed granite (CDG) typical of many residual soils, which has the characteristics to be sensitive to material and sample preparation and also to be compressive during shearing. It is found that adding discrete fibers to the CDG homogenizes it because the reinforced soil is not sensitive to the method of material or sample preparation. It is also found that, despite its compressive nature, fibers mobilize extra strength compared with the unreinforced soil, and this effect does not reduce at large confining stresses...|$|R
40|$|Bender element (BE) {{testing is}} a {{powerful}} and increasingly common laboratory technique for determining the shear S-wave velocity of geomaterials. There are several advantages of BE testing, {{but there is no}} standard developed for the testing procedures or for the interpretation of the results. This leads to high degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in the interpretation. In this paper, the authors review the most common methods for the interpretation of BE tests, discuss some important technical requirements to minimize errors, and propose a practical framework for BE testing, based oil the comparison of different interpretation techniques in order to obtain the most reliable value for the travel time. This new procedure consist,, of the application of a methodical, systematic, and objective approach for the interpretation of the results, in the time and frequency domains. I he use of an automated tool enables unbiased information to be obtained regarding variations in the results to assist in the decision of the travel time. Two natural soils were tested: residual soil from Porto granite, and Toyoura sand. Specimens were subjected to the same isotropic stress conditions and the results obtained provided insights on the effects of soil type and confining stress on the interpretation of BE results; namely, the differences in testing dry versus saturated soils, and in testing uniform versus <b>well-graded</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{comprehensive}} {{series of}} drained triaxial compression tests {{were performed on}} crushed concrete aggregate (CCA) moist as compacted. When compared to ordinary natural <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soils,</b> the peak strength and stiffness increase more significantly with dry density, while {{the effect of the}} degree of saturation during compaction is much less significant. In a range of confining pressure of 30 – 600 kPa, the strength and stiffness of well-compacted CCA is similar to, or, in some cases even higher than, typical selected high-class backfill materials (e. g., <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil</b> of crushed quarry hard rock). The strength and stiffness of CCA with a maximum particle size Dmax= 37. 5 mm obtained from a typical concrete crushing plant are noticeably lower than CCA sieved to Dmax= 19 mm compacted using the same energy. However, when compacted to the same dry density, the original CCA exhibits the strength and stiffness higher than the sieved CCA. Effects of the strength of original concrete on the strength and stiffness of compacted CCA are insignificant, while the strength and stiffness of compacted CCA are, respectively, noticeably higher than, or similar to, the original concrete aggregate (i. e., natural gravelly soil) compacted using the same energy. All these results indicate that well-compacted CCA can be used as the backfill material for important civil engineering soil structures requiring a high stability while allowing a limited amount of deformation...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} shows that a gap-graded soil or a widely-graded granular material may have a bimodal soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and a bimodal permeability function. A bimodal SWCC or a bimodal permeability function originates from a dual-porosity structure. To date, the prediction of bimodal SWCCs for gap-graded soils is still a difficult task. In this paper, a bimodal SWCC model is proposed to describe the drying process of granular soils considering a dual-porosity structure. The new SWCC model shows powerful capability in fitting the SWCCs for soils varying from gravel to silt. Regression analysis is conducted to establish empirical relations between the model parameters and the indexes of soil grain-size distribution (GSD). Based on these relations, the new model predicts well both the bimodal SWCCs for gap-graded soils and the unimodal SWCCs for <b>well-graded</b> <b>soils</b> and uniform soils. A bimodal permeability function is also proposed and linked to the new SWCC model. In the absence of experimental SWCCs and permeability functions, the new model {{can be used to}} obtain preliminary SWCCs and permeability functions for granular soils. It should be mentioned that the prediction of the SWCC from the GSD is still empirical and does not address the cyclic wetting/drying process. Measurement of the SWCC should be performed wherever an accurate SWCC is required. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{at small}} strains of compacted cemented-mixed <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil</b> was studied previously by other researchers [1]. In this present study, {{the effect of}} global unloading/reloading history on the Eeq values of the same material was studied. The small strain stiffness of geomaterial is usually evaluated by either dynamic tests (i. e., resonant column tests and wave propagation tests) or static tests (i. e., monotonic or cyclic loading tests measuring stresses and strains) or both. In the present study, by {{taking into account the}} fact that the specimen of compacted <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil</b> are not sufficiently homogeneous so that the wave velocity be representative of average small strain stiffness of a given specimen, the static tests were employed. To this end, a single or multiple unload/reload cycle(s) with a single amplitude axial strain of an order of 0. 001 % is (are) usually applied at different isotropic stress states or anisotropic stress states during otherwise monotonic loading, ML, of triaxial compression (TC) test, for example. The elastic young’s modulus, Ee, is ideally defined as the slope of a fully reversible cyclic stress-strain relation. However, it is actually not the case due to viscous property and non-linear inviscid stress – strain relation. For this reason, when a small unload/reload cycle is applied during otherwise ML, the overall stress-strain relation is shifted toward larger strains due to the viscous behaviour of the test material. The peak-to-peak secant modulus from a unload/reload cycle is defined as the equivalent Young’s modulus, Eeq, as shown in Figure 1. However, this value may be somehow different from the truly elastic modulus for the reason described above. Abbas Taher...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The soil-water {{characteristic}} curve for unsaturated mine soils (i. e., waste rock, and tailing) {{is a key}} parameter for predicting net infiltration {{in the design of}} soil caps, potential seepage from waste rock stockpiles, and the migration of potential seepage to groundwater. To expedite preliminary engineering analysis and design, computer programs are used to predict the soil-water {{characteristic curve}} based on particle size distribution. Observations of recent testing indicate that the theoretical models currently employed by these programs are accurate for uniform mine soils (i. e., tailing), but are not accurate for <b>well-graded</b> mine <b>soils</b> such as waste rock. Further research has shown that a combined theoretical/knowledge-based approach provides a more accurate prediction of the soil-water characteristic curve for mine soils such as waste rock. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the breakage behaviour of irregularly-shaped particles through experiments and DEM simulations. Experiments were performed on both uniform and non-uniform (<b>well-graded)</b> <b>soils,</b> while the DEM simulations were performed on 20 particles obtained from outlines of particles from one of the soils. The experiments on the uniform gradings explored the effect of increasing cycles and varying maximum normal stress, initial particle size and material on the breakage behaviour under repetitive compression. The uniform gradings were also sheared in either a small-diameter ring shear apparatus (SRS) or a large-diameter ring shear apparatus (LRS). This produced a non-uniform soil in order to explore the similarities and differences between the breakage behaviour of uniform and non-uniform soils under repetitive compression. The ultimate state grading under repetitive compression was compared with a theoretical terminal state grading (with a fractal dimension of 3). Repetitive compression and LRS tests were also performed on other non-uniform gradings in order to explore the competition between cushioning and particle size. An existing two-dimensional DEM model (described in Alonso-Marroquin & Wang, 2009) was modified in order to allow breakage of the particles. Various assemblies with different bond strengths were repetitively compressed to explore the effect of material strength on the breakage behaviour. It was noted that the breakage behaviours of the uniform and non-uniform soils had similarities, including the formation of a limiting compression curve (LCC) and a reduction of one standard deviation of aspect ratio. These behaviours were also noted in the DEM simulations, showing that the model is suitable for use in the exploration of breakage behaviour.

Undisturbed gravelly soils were taken {{by means of a}} new sampling method using thick water-soluble polymer solutions. The strength and deformation characteristics were evaluated mainly by performing sustained loading and large amplitude unloading and reloading cycles during otherwise monotonic loading at a constant strain rate in drained triaxial compression tests. During isotropic consolidation and shearing, at several stress states, eleven very small vertical cycles were applied to evaluate the quasi-elastic deformation property at small strain levels around 0. 001 % by static measurement. Dynamic measurements using a pair of accelerometers attached to the side surface of the specimen and wave sources attached to the top cap were also conducted at the same stress levels as static measurements in a single test. Several effects including grading characteristics and pressure level on the difference between the moduli measured statically and dynamically were discussed. The relationship between the small strain and strength properties of undisturbed gravelly soils was evaluated. The small strain properties of air-dried dense Toyoura sand in large-scale triaxial compression tests were also investigated in this study to compare the results of undisturbed gravelly soils...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} dynamic {{centrifuge}} model tests {{was conducted in}} order to evaluate some factors affecting the seismic performance of hillside embankments consisting of sandy or silty soils and resting on stiff base slope. The effects of seepage water elevation in embankments, toe drain, embankment height, base slope inclination, soil compaction, and fill materials on the seismic behaviour of embankments were investigated. The test results showed that: (1) the seepage water {{was one of the}} most important factors for earthquake-induced embankment failure; (2) the seismic performance of both the smaller and higher embankments was remarkably improved by installing the toe drain; (3) larger base slope inclination produced larger earthquake-induced deformation of embankments; (4) well-compacted embankments were not vulnerable to earthquake-induced damage; and (5) the seismic performance of well-compacted embankments consisting of <b>well-graded</b> silty <b>soils</b> with large fines content was higher than that of poorly graded sands under otherwise the same condition. In some tests, as observed during past strong earthquakes, delayed flow failure occurred due possibly to the multiple effects of upward seepage associated with the redistribution of excess pore water pressures generated during main shaking, continued small vibration after main shaking, and driving static shear stresses caused by the embankment weight. A series of triaxial compression and cyclic triaxial liquefaction tests was also conducted to evaluate undrained behaviour of the fill materials. The correlation between the model and laboratory element test results was presented...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability for the coarse fraction of a broadly-graded soil to prevent the loss of its fine fraction due to seepage flow. The internal stability of a soil is influenced by geometric conditions (i. e. grain sizes and their distribution and pore sizes and their distribution), hydraulic conditions (i. e. hydraulic gradient and flow direction), and mechanical conditions (i. e. compaction efforts). From the geometric standpoint, soils are classified into two groups: well-graded and gap-graded, {{based on the information}} of 167 soils in a laboratory test dataset and understanding on the control variables for internal stability. Each group is further divided into three categories according to the fines content (< 0. 063 mm). Finally, new internal stability criteria for each category of <b>well-graded</b> and gap-graded <b>soils</b> are proposed. From the hydraulic point of view, the influence of complex stress states on the initiation and development of seepage erosion is investigated.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{backfill}} {{is mixed}} with cement and compacted in the field, {{it is very difficult}} to obtain the multiple similar samples needed to determine a Mohr–Coulomb (M–C) failure envelope by a set of triaxial compression (TC) tests at different levels of effective confining pressure (σ′hs), due to the inevitably large heterogeneity. The effects of the intermediate loading histories, with and without large stress–amplitude unload/reload cycles, on the stress–strain properties of compacted cement-mixed <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil,</b> particularly the peak strength, were evaluated in multiple-step loading (ML) drained TC tests using a single specimen. A set of single-step loading (SL) tests at different σ′hs were also performed. Similar specimens, prepared in the laboratory, were used for the tests in this study. Although the M–C failure envelope can be quite accurately determined by relevant ML tests, the peak strength may be underestimated if (a) TC loading is ceased far before the peak stress state or (b) TC reloading is started after the peak stress state has been passed at previous loading steps. Cases (a) and (b) may take place in both ML tests, with increasing and decreasing σ′h, while Case (b) may take place in ML tests with decreasing σ′h. The reloading stress–strain relation at the intermediate stage in ML tests may become very soft due to the additional damage caused by a negative irreversible shear strain increment occurring in the immediately preceding unloading process. This effect gradually decreases during reloading, while it totally disappears once large-scale yielding has started, with essentially no effect on the peak strength. It is of the first priority to perform ML tests by increasing σ′h. It is recommended that ML tests be performed by decreasing σ′h if possible, because the peak stress may be closely reached at some intermediate steps. An upper envelope of results from a pair of ML tests, with increasing and decreasing σ′h, could be more representative of the true M–C failure envelope...|$|R
40|$|Streambeds are {{important}} fish passageways in Oregon; they {{provide for the}} necessary habitats and spawning cycles of a healthy fish population. Oregon state law requires that hydraulic structures located in water properly provide fish passage. Increasingly stringent state and federal regulations apply to these fish passageways, and designers must become more cognizant of conditions over a range of flows to accommodate fish movement and avoid expensive structural failure of these passageways. Fish passage structures are built when roads cross streambeds and may include culverts, or bridges. When these structures are built, the streambeds are re-created using a technique called “roughened channels”. Roughened channels are man-made stream channels utilized for re-creating the hydraulics necessary for adequate stream passage, and this may include new constructions or retrofits of older, inadequate structures. Mixtures of materials are used to construct the bed of roughened channels, ranging from fines such as sand, silt and gravel to coarse elements like cobbles and boulders. Fines are a critical element in limiting permeability of the constructed bed thus keeping stream flow at {{the surface of the}} roughened channel during low flow periods. This report discusses work of a research project designed to discover factors that are key to successful long-term implementation of fish passageways, especially focused on the construction process. Areas of inquiry postulated in this study are that failures experienced in actual installations may be due to inadequate range and/or mix of soil and rock material gradation; unexpected water velocity, especially during high flows; inadequate mixing of rock and soil materials during construction; and inadequate compaction of rock and soil materials during construction. This report suggests that several factors may be especially important considerations in fish passage success. These factors are the relationship of downstream slope to structure slope, <b>well-graded</b> fine <b>soil</b> materials in the channel fill (improved by choice of fill source), and frequent site visits. Improving fish passages for cost-efficient fish movement is a priority for government agencies such as Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and Oregon Transportation Research and Education Consortium (OTREC) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from September 20, 2016 - September 20, 2017 The implementation and construction of Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls has undergone substantial expansions in recent years, owing to its relatively low cost, ease of construction, and high efficiency compared to conventional retaining methods. As a result, MSE walls are being constructed to greater heights with complex features (e. g. multiple tiers, equivalent batter angles, close reinforcement spacing) even though impacts on wall response associated with these characteristics are not well understood. Available methods to predict wall responses are limited to empirical databases of single tiered walls less than 20 m and designers are left to complex finite element modelling to estimate the behavior of tall walls (walls with heights greater than 20 m). The current study aims to provide practitioners with {{a better understanding of}} the working stress behavior of tall MSE walls during and after construction through the use of a calibrated numerical model that incorporates pressure dependent soil, panel-soil interaction, non-linear soil reinforcement interaction, facing rigidity, foundation stiffness, and compaction stresses. First, an extensive laboratory investigation is conducted to characterize the plane strain and three dimensional stress-strain and stress-dilatancy response of a <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil.</b> Laboratory pullout tests are performed to characterize the influence of reinforcement spacing on load-displacement response. Results from the high quality laboratory investigations are used to calibrate specific numerical elements in FLAC (e. g. reinforcement-soil interface, facing-soil interface, soil constitutive response) incorporating pressure dependent constitutive responses. A numerical model representing a 46 m tall MSE wall is developed in FLAC, incorporating calibrated element parameters. Measurements made during the construction of a 46 m tall MSE wall are used to establish those factors within the model that most accurately simulate the observed wall performance. Results from a geometric parametric study conducted to assess the influence of boundary conditions on wall response are presented, focusing on impacts associated with tier height, tier offset, and wall height. The synthesis of the results from the geometric parametric study are used to establish a more thorough understanding of wall response, with specific emphasis on wall displacements and reinforcement strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} loading {{histories}} on small-strain and large-strain stiffness of a compacted cement-mixed <b>well-graded</b> gravelly <b>soil</b> {{were evaluated by}} consolidated drained triaxial compression (TC) tests. Various cyclic loading histories were applied during otherwise continuous monotonic loading at different confining pressures, r h s, and multiple-step loading with stepwise increase or decrease of r h. To evaluate small-strain stiffness, minute unload/reload cycles were applied during TC loading. The value of peak-to-peak secant modulus from a minute unload/reload cycle {{was defined as the}} equivalent Young’s modulus, E eq. The average of E eq values measured during continuous monotonic loading at low deviator stresses was rather close to the elastic modulus, E e. As the E e increased with an increase in the axial stress, the E eq value increased first and then decreased due to an increase in creep strains. The stress–strain behaviour after the start of a large-scale yielding and the peak shear strength is not noticeably affected by the previous cyclic loading with relatively large stress amplitude. However, the large-strain stiffness during reloading is significantly affected by the following factors controlled by pre-cyclic loading history; (a) strain hard- ening; (b) strain nonlinearity; (c) hysteresis effect; (d) vis- cous effect; and (e) damage to bonding by immediately preceding large unloading. The tangent stiffness, E tan,ata given stress level during reloading becoming larger with an increase in the effects of factor (a) and smaller by the effects of factors (b), (c), (d) and (e). In addition, increase of r h has a negative effect on stiffness of primary loading curves and a positive effect on stiffness of reloading curves. The effect of loading history on the small-strain stiffness in terms of equivalent Young’s modulus, E eq, was found to be significant. This effect depends on various factors. Four factors—axial stress level, strain-hardening effect, creep effect by the viscous properties and damage due to a loading history—were identified to be responsible for equivalent Young’s modulus, E eq variations. Axial stress increase and strain-hardening effect both increase E eq, making E eq closer to the E e. However, creep strains by the viscous properties and damage due to a loading history both decrease E eq. Abbas Taheri, Fumio Tatsuok...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{laboratory and}} field investigation {{was conducted at}} Santa Maria Regional Landfill (SMRL) in Santa Maria, CA {{to determine the effects}} of waste placement practices on the engineering response of municipal solid waste (MSW). Laboratory and field testing was used to determine the engineering properties and monitor field response of MSW. The specific gravity (Gs) of manufactured MSW (MMSW), fresh MSW (FMSW), and old MSW (OMSW) was determined experimentally using a modified version of standard soil testing procedures. Effects of particle size, compactive effort, and degradation on the specific gravity of waste were evaluated. Specific gravity of manufactured waste samples increased with decreasing particle size, with compaction, and with increased degradation. The average specific gravity of uncompacted MMSW samples was 1. 333, 1. 374, and 1. 424 for coarse, medium, and fine particle sizes, respectively. Specific gravity of coarse, medium, and fine MMSW samples compacted at dry of optimum (= 30 %) was determined to be 1. 497, 1. 521, and 1. 552, respectively and at wet of optimum (= 90 %) to be 1. 500, 1. 542, and 1. 570, respectively. The compacted and uncompacted specific gravity of fresh MSW was lower than manufactured and old MSW. The average Gs of uncompacted and compacted fresh MSW was 1. 072 and 1. 208, respectively whereas old MSW had Gs of 2. 201. Additional physical and engineering properties of MSW were determined for fresh and old wastes. A total of 8 magnetic extensometer settlement arrays and 4 thermocouple arrays were installed in old wastes. The settlement and temperature data were collected for an approximate duration of 1 year. In addition, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the particle size distribution, organic content, and moisture content of fresh waste sampled from the active face of the landfill and from old waste sampled from different depths. The particle size distribution of OMSW was comparable to a <b>well-graded</b> coarse-grained <b>soil.</b> The average baseline moisture content of incoming MSW at SMRL was 42. 7 % (dry-weight basis). The average moisture content of residential MSW, commercial MSW, and self-delivered MSW were determined to be 57. 7, 46. 3, and 12. 0 %, respectively. The organic content of fresh and old MSW was determined to be 77. 2 and 23. 5 %, respectively. Temperature increased over time due to heat generation of the waste mass. The temperature increased on average 3 to 6 °C between the initial and final day of measurements for wastes that were 0. 3 to 9 years old. Fresh and old wastes at SMRL exhibited unique compression behavior. A majority of the waste was undergoing secondary compression characterized using a secondary compression ratio () ranging from 0. 013 to 0. 067 with an average of 0. 030. In addition, the fresh and old wastes exhibited recompression behavior. Fresh waste lifts were determined to be slightly overconsolidated such that the self-weight of the fresh waste was less than the preconsolidation stress. The old waste exhibited recompression behavior during loading and unloading of an earthen embankment. The modified recompression indices () for fresh and old wastes were determined to be 0. 076 and 0. 012, respectively. The initial compression ratio for old wastes () was quantified for the old waste lifts to be between 0. 069 and 0. 332. Finally, meso- and full-scale field compaction experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} systematic moisture addition prior to compaction on placement efficiency and compaction characteristics of MSW. Two 16 x 46 m test plots were constructed for the meso-scale compaction tests. Approximately 890 kN (100 tons) of residential MSW (RMSW) was placed into a test plot and compacted at target moisture contents of 55 (baseline as-received), 65, 80, 95, and 110 %. Compaction curves generated for RMSW were bell shaped and similar to soil compaction curves. The maximum dry unit weight () and operational unit weight () for the meso-scale compaction study were 8. 5 and 13. 3 kN/m 3 with corresponding optimum moisture contents of and, 78. 5 and 79. 5 %, respectively. Moisture addition prior to compaction yielded beneficial waste placement results. An operational waste placement factor (OWPF) was defined as additional amount of waste that could be placed in one unit of volume. OWPF values were determined to be 1, 1. 33, 1. 66, 1. 37, and 0. 83 for RMSW compacted at target moisture contents of 55, 65, 85, 90, and 110 %, respectively. The full scale compaction investigation was conducted in a similar manner to the meso-scale investigation. However, the compaction tests were conducted on the active face of the landfill and representative of the entire incoming daily waste stream. A daily average of 2940 kN (330 tons) of MSW was placed and compacted at target moisture contents of 45 (baseline as-received), 65, 85, and 105 %. Compaction curves for the delivered MSW were bell shaped and similar to soil compaction curves. The maximum dry and operational unit weights for the full-scale test were 7. 0 and 9. 8 kN/m 3, respectively corresponding to optimum moisture contents of and, 76 and 75. 5 %, respectively. OWPFs were calculated to be 1, 1. 28, 1. 55, and 0. 80 for target moisture contents of 45, 65, 85, and 105 %, respectively. The spatial variability associated with moisture addition also was determined for the meso- and full-scale compaction tests and verified using test pits and spatial sampling of the surface of the active face. Particularly, the variations in degree of saturation (S) and volumetric moisture content () due to moisture addition were estimated. For waste compacted at target moisture contents of 55, 65, 80, and 110 % during the meso-scale tests, S increased by 19, 4. 5, 4. 4, and 4. 3 %, respectively while increased by 28, 7. 7, 8. 1, and 5. 7 %, respectively. For the full scale compaction tests, S increased by an average of 43 % and increased by an average of 78 %. The average moisture content of waste at the surface after compaction at 45 % moisture content (i. e., as-received) and at 80 % moisture content (i. e., near optimum) were 34 and 133 %, respectively. The results of the investigation have environmental, operational, and financial implications such as extend the life of a landfill, ability to place more wastes in a unit landfill volume, and increasing to values above field capacity with moisture addition during compaction...|$|R
