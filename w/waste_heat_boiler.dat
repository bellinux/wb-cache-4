50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the Mount Isa copper ISASMELT plant and all the others is that it uses an Ahlstrom Fluxflow® <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> to recover heat from the furnace waste gas. This boiler uses a recirculating fluid bed of particles to rapidly quench the gas as it leaves the furnace, and then uses the enhanced heat transfer properties of solid-solid contact to cool the particles as they are carried past boiler tubes that are suspended in a shaft above the bed. The high heat transfer rate means that the Fluxflow® boiler is relatively compact compared with conventional waste heat boilers and the rapid cooling of the waste gas limits the formation of sulfur trioxide ("SO3"), which in the presence of water forms sulfuric acid that can cause corrosion of cool surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Enefit {{process is}} a {{modification}} of the Galoter process being developed by Enefit Outotec Technology. [...] In this process, the Galoter technology is combined with proven circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology used in coal-fired power plants and mineral processing. Oil shale particles and hot oil shale ash are mixed in a rotary drum as in the classical Galoter process. The primary modification is the replacing of the Galoter semi-coke furnace with a CFB furnace. The Enefit process also incorporates fluid bed ash cooler and <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> commonly used in coal-fired boilers to convert waste heat to steam for power generation. Compared to the traditional Galoter, the Enefit process allows complete combustion of carbonaceous residue, improved energy efficiency by maximum utilization of waste heat, and less water use for quenching. According to promoters, the Enefit process has a lower retorting time compare to the classical Galoter process and therefore it has a greater throughput. Avoidance of moving parts in the retorting zones increases their durability.|$|E

50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical Retort House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical Retort House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical Retort House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal Retort House.|$|E

40|$|The cement {{industry}} {{is the most}} energy-intensive industry in the United States in terms of energy cost {{as a percentage of}} the total product cost. An assessment of gas-side fouling in cement plants with special emphasis on heat recovery applications is provided. In the present context, fouling is defined as the buildup of scale on a heat-transfer surface which retards the transfer of heat and includes the related problems of erosion and corrosion. Exhaust gases in the {{cement industry}} which are suitable for heat recovery range in temperature from about 100 to 1300 K, are generally dusty, may be highly abrasive, and are often heavily laden with alkalies, sulfates, and chlorides. Particulates in the exhaust streams range in size from molecular to about 100 micrometers in diameter and come from both the raw feed as well as the ash in the coal which is the primary fuel used in the cement industry. The major types of heat-transfer equipment used in the cement industry include preheaters, gas-to-air <b>heat</b> exchangers, <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> <b>boilers,</b> and clinker coolers.

The present paper reports various problems (such as agglomeration, slagging, fouling, caustic embrittlement, fatigue failure and high temperature corrosion) related to boilers and their possible solutions. Some of the controlling parameters for high temperature corrosion has also been studied viz use of inhibitors, varying temperature and pressure, sol–gel coating and thermal spray coating.
