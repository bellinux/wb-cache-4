60|$|Now that I am a settled man {{and have}} many birds--the {{canaries}} have just hatched out four nestlings--I have before me {{the problem that}} Locke waved aside. As I gave them an artificial nest, a hollow vessel like a saucer, they had no need of that skill the wild bird shows, each species having its own preference among the lichen, or moss; but they could sort out <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> and a certain soft white down that I found under a big tree. They would twist a stem of grass till it was limber, and would wind it all about {{the centre of the}} nest, and when the four grey eggs were laid, the mother bird knew how to turn them over from time to time, that they might be warmed evenly; and how long she must leave them uncovered, that the white might not be dried up, and when to return that the growing bird might not take cold. Then the young birds, even when they had all their feathers, were very still as compared with the older birds, as though any habit of movement would disturb the nest or make them tumble out. One of them would now and again pass on the food that he had received from his mother's beak to some other nestling. The father had often pecked the mother bird before the eggs were laid, but now, until the last nestling was decently feathered, he took his share in the feeding, and was very peaceable, and it was only when the young could be left to feed themselves that he grew jealous and had to be put into another cage.|$|E
60|$|He {{had changed}} pitifully {{in the last}} six months. His hair was a dusty, {{yellowish}} gray, like the chemisal on the flanks of Heavytree Hill; his face was waxen white, and blue and puffy under the eyes; his clothes were soiled and shabby, streaked in front with the stains of hurriedly eaten luncheons, and fluffy behind with the <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> of hurriedly-extemporized couches. In obedience to that odd law, that, the more seedy and soiled a man's garments become, the less does he seem inclined to part with them, even during that portion of the twenty-four hours when they are deemed less essential, Plunkett's clothes had gradually taken on the appearance of a kind of a bark, or an outgrowth from within, for which their possessor was not entirely responsible. Howbeit, as he entered the room, he attempted to button his coat over a dirty shirt, and passed his fingers, after the manner of some animal, over his cracker-strewn beard, in recognition of a cleanly public sentiment. But, even as he did so, the weak smile faded from his lips; and his hand, after fumbling aimlessly around a button, dropped helplessly at his side. For as he leaned his back against the bar, and faced the group, he, for the first time, became aware that every eye but one was fixed upon him. His quick, nervous apprehension at once leaped to the truth. His miserable secret was out, and abroad in the very air about him. As a last resort, he glanced despairingly at Henry York; but his flushed face was turned toward the windows.|$|E

6000|$|Next {{they came}} to another island, {{where there was a}} bay with rocks around, with goats leaping on them. Here Ulysses left eleven ships, and sailed with one to explore the little islet opposite. Landing with his men, he entered an {{enormous}} cavern, well stored with bowls of milk and cream, and with rows of cheeses standing on the ledges of rock. While the Greeks were regaling themselves, a noise was heard, and great flocks of sheep and goats came bleating in. Behind them came a giant, with a fir tree for a staff, and only one eye {{in the middle of his}} forehead. He was Polyphemus, one of the Cyclops, sons of Neptune, and workmen of Vulcan. He asked fiercely who the strangers were, and Ulysses told him that they were shipwrecked sailors, imploring him for hospitality in the name of the gods. Polyphemus laughed at this, saying he was stronger than the gods, and did not care for them; and, dashing two unhappy Greeks on the floor, he ate them up at once; after which he closed up the front of the cave with a monstrous rock, penned up the kids and lambs, and began to milk his goats, drank up a great quantity of milk, and fell asleep on the ground. Ulysses thought of killing him at once, but recollected that the stone at the mouth of the cave would keep him captive if the giant’s strength did not move it, and abstained. In the morning the Cyclops let out his flocks, and then shut the Greeks in with the stone; but he left his staff behind, and Ulysses hardened the top of this in the fire. A skin of wine had been brought from the ships, and when Polyphemus came home in the evening, and had devoured two more Greeks, Ulysses offered it to him. It was the first wine he had tasted, and he was in raptures with it, asking his guest’s name as he pledged him. “No-man,” replied Ulysses, begging again for mercy. “This will I grant,” said the Cyclops, “in return for thy gift. No-man shall be the last whom I devour.” He drank up the whole skin of wine, and went to sleep. Then Ulysses and four of his companions seized the staff, and forced its sharpened top into the Cyclops’ single eye, so that he awoke blind, and roaring with pain so loud that all the other Cyclops awoke, and came calling to know who had hurt him. “No-man,” shouted back Polyphemus; and they, thinking it was only some sudden illness, went back to their caves. Meanwhile, Ulysses was fastening the remaining Greeks under the bellies of the sheep and goats, the <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> hanging over them. He himself clung on under the largest goat, the master of the herd. When morning came, bleatings of the herds caused the blind giant to rouse himself to roll back the stone from the entrance. He laid his hand on each beast’s back, that his guests might not ride out on them, but he did not feel beneath, though he kept back Ulysses’ goat for a moment caressing it, and saying, “My pretty goat, thou seest me, but I cannot see thee.” ...|$|E

50|$|Common {{natural fibres}} for rope are manila hemp, hemp, feathers, linen, cotton, coir, jute, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include polypropylene, nylon, polyesters (e.g. PET, LCP, Vectran), {{polyethylene}} (e.g. Dyneema and Spectra), Aramids (e.g. Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (e.g. Dralon). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. Wire rope {{is made of}} steel or other metal alloys. Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as silk, <b>wool,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair,</b> but such ropes are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.|$|E
5000|$|The Wiltshire Horn is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep originally from Wiltshire in southern England raised for meat. [...] The breed is unusual amongst native British breeds, for {{it has the}} unusual feature of moulting its short <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> coat naturally in spring, alleviating the need for shearing. They are good mothers and have high fertility. The fact {{that they do not}} require shearing or crutching and do not suffer readily from flystrike is making them increasingly attractive to the commercial sheep sector, particularly as even pure-bred lambs can reach slaughter weight in as little as 16 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Breeding pairs form in late winter. The {{breeding}} {{territory and}} several pairs will often nest close {{together in a}} loose colony. The cup-shaped nest is built by the female, usually in a shrub or tree. It is made of twigs and plant stems with an inner layer of roots, grass, moss, leaves, and other vegetation and a lining of feathers, <b>wool,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair.</b> Two to seven eggs are laid. They are pale bluish or greenish with reddish or brownish blotches and streaks. The female incubates the eggs for 12-15 days while being fed by the male.

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long <b>wools</b> <b>and</b> <b>hairs</b> which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R

40|$|Recovery and reuse of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> {{waste is}} a {{challenge}} with the ultimate goal environment protection. One of {{the early stages of}} the recovery process is the operation of scouring-degreasing wool and human hair waste. In recent decades the use of ultrasound technology has established an important place in different industrial processes and has started to revolutionize environmental protection. The power of ultrasound can enhance a wide variety of chemical and physical processes, mainly due to the phenomenon known as cavitation in a liquid medium. The objective of the present work is to develop eco-friendly effective degreasing system for keratin fiber waste with the aid of ultrasound, using distilled water and also trichlorethylene as a medium of propagation-degreasing, and realized a comparative analysis of efficiency of fat extraction by Soxhlet classical method and via ultrasonication. This work investigate the effect that ultrasonic irradiation has on the structure of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> fibers. Thus were highlighted both morphological and structural changes of treated materials using optical microscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy. By using the unconventional method of cleaning and degreasing with an ultrasonic resonator tube are possible reductions in utility and solvents consumption together with changes in the cuticular layer of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> fibers...|$|E

40|$|During {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{significant}} increase in industrial anthrax among workers handling imported <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair.</b> In some areas this increase has assumed the proportions of a minor epidemic. This trend is reflected in the statistics from one state alone in which a total of 24 cases of industrial anthrax were reported from January 1 to September 30, 1949. Although all of these cases occurred in the carpet-manufacturing industry, 22 of them were confined to a single plant. An urgent need has thus been demonstrated for the development of effective, nondeleterious methods for the disinfection of imported animal prod-ucts. In a 20 -year survey on the incidence of anthrax in the United States for the period from 1919 to 1938, Smyth (1939) reported a total of 1, 683 recorded cases. Of this number, hides, skins, <b>wool,</b> <b>and</b> <b>hair</b> were responsible for 754 cases.

40|$|To {{determine}} immunologic reactivity to Bacillus anthrax antigens, {{we conducted}} serologic testing {{of workers in}} a factory that performed scouring of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> goat <b>hair.</b> Of 66 workers, ≈ 10 % had circulating antibodies or T lymphocytes that reacted with anthrax protective antigen. Individual immunity varied from undetectable to high. Industrial anthrax, also known as woolsorter’s disease, was a serious threat in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries when the wool industry was flourishing. The causal agent, Bacillus anthracis, was brought into factories in sporulated form with the organic matter that was contaminating the animal fibers. The pathogen provoked the characteristic necrotic lesions on {{the skin of the}} wool workers (cutaneous anthrax), but it could also cause a respiratory disease through airborne transmission (inhalational anthrax). In 1950, 90 % of those with the latter form died, although the proportion of deaths could be lowered to 50 % with the aggressive therapy that was later used to treat the victims of the deliberate release of anthrax in the United States in 2001 (1, 2). Today, industrial processing of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> goat <b>hair</b> has almost disappeared from Western industrialized countries.
