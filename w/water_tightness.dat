40|$|The {{continuing}} {{growth in}} the importance of oil and gas production and processing overall the globe increase the need for accurate prediction of various parameters and their impact on unit operations, process simulation and design. Because of the particular nature of various parameters, sometimes existing methods encounter difficulties. Currently several models are available to predict various design parameters in the oil and gas processing industries. However, their calculations may require rigorous computer solutions. Therefore, developing the new predictive tools to which are easier than the existing methods, less complicated with fewer computations to minimize the complex and time-consuming calculation steps is an essential need. It is apparent that mathematically compact, simple, and reasonably accurate predictive tools, as proposed in this thesis, would be preferable for computationally intensive simulations. In fact, the development of engineering correlations by a modification to the well-known Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) [1921 - 1926] equation and Arrhenius equation (1889) was the primary motivation of the present thesis, which, nevertheless, yielded predictive tools with accuracy comparable to that of the existing rigorous simulations. Hence, some existing approaches lead to complicated equations for the purposes of engineering importance. This problem has been circumvented conveniently by resorting to simpler approaches, as described in this thesis. The purpose of the proposed Dissertation work is to develop and formulate accurate and reliable predictive tools to serve two purposes. First, being conversion of a set of highly correlated variables to a set of independent variables by using linear transformations. Second one is for variable reductions. When a dependent variable is specified, the method is very efficient for dimensional reduction due to the supervised nature of its methodology. The developed tools in this study can be immense engineering value to predict different process design parameters, including the prediction of hydrate forming conditions of natural gases, hydrate forming pressure of pure alkanes in the presence of inhibitors, water-hydrocarbon systems mutual solubilities, water content of natural gas, density, thermal conductivity and viscosity of aqueous glycol solutions, optimum size of inlet scrubber and contactor in natural gas dehydration systems, estimation of water-adsorption isotherms, estimation of equilibrium water dew point of natural gas in triethylene glycol dehydration systems, true vapour pressure (TVP) of LPG and natural gasoline, hydrocarbon components solubilities in hydrate inhibitors, methanol vaporization loss and solubility in hydrocarbon liquid phase for gas hydrate inhibition, storage pressure of gasoline in uninsulated tanks, emissivity of combustion gases, filling losses from storage containers,bulk modulus and volumetric expansion coefficient of <b>water</b> for leak <b>tightness</b> test of pipelines, silica solubility and carry-over in steam, carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption isotherms, estimation of packed column size, estimation of thermal insulation thickness, transport properties of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, estimation of economic thermal insulation thickness, water content of air at elevated pressures, surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons, aqueous solubility and density of carbon dioxide, aqueous solubility of light hydrocarbons, thermal conductivity of hydrocarbons, downcomer design velocity and vapour capacity correction factor in fractionators, estimation of convection heat transfer coefficients and efficiencies for finned tubular sections, estimation of heat losses from process piping and equipment surfaces, prediction of absorption/stripping factors, correlating theoretical stages and operating reflux in fractionators, design of radiant and convective sections of direct fired heaters and many other engineering parameters. Following the development of predictive tools, experimental work was undertaken to measure the density and viscosity, of ethylene glycol + water, diethylene glycol + water, and triethylene glycol + water mixtures at temperatures ranging from 290 K to 440 K and concentrations ranging from 20 mol % glycol to 100 mol % glycol. Our data were correlated using a novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and a thermodynamical method (the generalized corresponding states principle (GCSP)). Both novel Arrhenius-type equation based predictive tool and GCSP method, with two adjustable parameters for each property, offer the potential for judicious extrapolation of density and viscosity data for all glycol + water mixtures. In addition, in this thesis, the PreTOG software package has been developed, which covers a wide range of parameters in oil, gas and chemical processing industries and is using PC-based Windows and Matlab graphical user interfaces and tool boxes. The PreTOG software is also available on an stand-alone CD. Finally the following typical case studies for potential benefits to various processing plants industries will be presented and the results of new proposed model are compared with partial least squares (PLS) and principal component analysis (PCA) : •Methanol vaporization loss during gas hydrate inhibition •Methanol loss in condensate liquid phase during gas hydrate inhibition •Estimation of potential savings from reducing unburned combustible losses in coal-fired systems •Recoverable heat from blowdown systems during steam generation •Energy conservation benefits in excess air controlled gas-fired systems •Prediction of salinity of salty crude oi...|$|R

5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure <b>water</b> <b>tightness.</b> At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>tightness</b> of a {{concrete}} cover layer is important, {{as it is}} typically used as a protective coating of the steel reinforcement. <b>Water</b> <b>tightness</b> can be impaired by crack formation or by permeability. A bacteria-based lactate-derived healing agent (HA) {{can be added to}} concrete to enhance the potential for restoration of <b>water</b> <b>tightness.</b> Bacterial conversion of the included carbon source results in CO 2 production and subsequent CaCO 3 precipitation, similar to the mechanism of concrete carbonation. Carbonation is known to densify concrete, particularly when using ordinary Portland cement (OPC), but to a much lower extend in slag-based concrete (CEM III/B). To identify the effect of HA addition on concrete properties, this study focusses on the ingress of moisture in non-cracked concrete surfaces by assessing capillary water absorption. Surface properties were determined for sealed and unsealed surfaces of concrete—either based on OPC or CEM III/B—before and after curing under three different conditions: Dry, wet, or humid. HA addition to concrete containing slag cement generated a surface less prone to continued drying, but resulted in higher water absorption. In contrast, surface water absorption significantly decreased upon HA addition to OPC-based samples, independent of the curing regime. It is therefore concluded that HA in its current form is suitable for application in OPC, but less in CEM III/B-based mixture...|$|E

The need to incorporate geotechnical design implications, in dam foundation studies, besides the geological descriptions which are involved in current classification schemes, is considered. The void volumes in the rock foundations of earth and rockfill dams, in three different geological environments in Greece, are assessed by the grout volumes spent in sealing off the dam rock foundations, and expressed as distinct grouting parameters.

Seals of this type have been examined as a possible {{solution to the problem}} with ship manoeuvring propulsion sealing. The present analysis bases on laboratory durability tests of magnetic fluid seals exposed to longterm utility water loads, at different water pressures and shaft revolutions. The basic seal durability criterion was the number of revolutions made by the sealing node shaft until the appearance of <b>water</b> <b>tightness</b> loss (leakage). It was found that the main factor leading to the wear of the seal is the relative speed of the magnetic fluid with respect to that of the utility water, and this process is heavily affected by the pressure acting on the seal. The reported test results are presented in the form of diagrams showing the seal durability (time until <b>water</b> <b>tightness</b> loss) as a function of rotational speed. The curves shown in the diagrams are regular, with two different rotational speed ranges: the highspeed range, when the tightness loss is relatively fast, and the low-speed range, with a clear tendency to prolong the seal lifetime. These diagrams were given the name of durability curves of the MF seal operating in water. The results of the performed tests suggest formal similarity between the experimental data distribution concerning tightness loss processes occurring in magnetic fluid seals operating in water environment and metal fatigue processes.
