5|$|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege {{received}} positive reviews. Critics generally {{praised the}} game's destructive environment, tactical nature, map design, and {{its focus on}} teamwork.

5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence.

Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the 12th Devons {{had arrived in}} the divisional area from the landing beaches and were ordered to take over the defence of the Bas de Ranville from the 12th Parachute Battalion.

5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity. After the {{communist}} takeover {{of power in}} Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of organizations {{in the country and}} tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations.

5|$|All {{publications}} and media <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing}} to cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|British Governor Valentine Morris and {{military}} commander Lieutenant Colonel George Etherington disagreed {{on how to}} react and ended up surrendering without significant resistance.

5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered <b>were</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E
