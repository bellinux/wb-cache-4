This research showed that the silk fibers produced by the luna moth had morphological and physical structure {{similar to that of the}} common <b>wild</b> <b>silks</b> but tensile properties similar to that of B. mori silk. A. lunas silk fibers are composed of higher amounts of hydropho­bic amino acids and had much less glycine than B. mori and common <b>wild</b> <b>silks.</b> With a fineness of 2 denier, breaking tenacity of 4. 3 g/den and breaking elongation of 10. 9 %, the tensile properties of A. lunas silk fibers were similar to that of B. mori and much better than that of the common <b>wild</b> <b>silks</b> that are coarser and have lower breaking tenac­ity.

500|$|Silk {{was made}} using various breeds of lepidopterans, both wild and domestic. While <b>wild</b> <b>silks</b> were {{produced}} in many countries, {{there is no}} doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective species for silk production, the Bombyx mandarina and its domesticated descendent B. mori. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large spool, thanks to a backwards and forward motion. Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China. [...] The spinning wheel, in all likelihood moved by hand, was known by the beginning of the Christian era.

2500|$|Several {{kinds of}} <b>wild</b> <b>silk,</b> which are {{produced}} by caterpillars other than the mulberry silkworm, have been known and used in China, South Asia, and Europe since ancient times. However, the scale of production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks. There are several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and [...] and are therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk. Thus, {{the only way to}} obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and labor-intensive carding.|$|E

Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay {{to the north of the}} chamber. The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6inches) tall. Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms.

40|$|Silk was an {{industry}} of longstanding provenance in precolonial India, highly specialized by {{region and the}} specific markets it provided. It was well known from the Punjab, Dacca and Bengal, Surat and Ahmedabad, Benares, and Hyderabad; in South India silk and cotton mixes were produced in Mylapore, Tanjore, Trichinopoly and Madurai. <b>Wild</b> <b>silks</b> (moonga) were known in India “from time immemorial” and produced for the Arab market. 1 Yet {{a recent survey of}} the early European and Eurasi{{an industry}} mentions the Indian silk industry only once, as “known in India before our era. ” 2 From the early medieval origins of South Indian production, the industry flourished during the Vijayanagar Empire of the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries in the Karnataka, Andhra and Tamil regions. Silk production in new cotton and silk mixes (mushroo and himroo) also expanded in the Deccan and the Mughal courts in the fashionable dress of the nobility. 3 Silk production in South India for export to Europe became an East India Company project in the later eighteenth century, {{at a time when it}} was seeking cheaper alternatives for European, Persian and Chinese silks on the London luxury market. A series of South Indian silk projects also found its context in Enlightenment projects of “useful knowledge” and industrial improvement. This article investigates James Anderson’s silk projects on the Coromandel coast. Though the projects ultimately failed, they show dedicated attempts to adapt and transfer technologies and substantial investment by the East India Company. Detailed analysis of the setting-up phases, early progress, then failure of a number of these projects shows a common lack of engagement with local environmental constraints and local commercial incentives among farmers and zamindars...|$|R

This is done by combining ecodesign approaches; specifically digital printing, organic base cloths, and long life design (Jonathon Chapman). The research investigated methods of pre-treating new eco textile base cloths for digital print, and incorporating it within a vintage garment. It is part of TED’s AHRC funded collaborative research project – ‘Ever & Again: Rethinking Recycled Textiles’. This research extends the environmental benefits of digital printing over traditional printing by investigating eco fabric base cloths. The research looks at methods of pre-treatmenting of organic cotton, <b>wild</b> <b>silks</b> and hemp, and was developed with commercial partners, RA Smarts (www. belfordprints. co. uk), and Cameron Gilmartin, London. This is a new development in the UK for the combined fields of digital print and eco design. (See similar work being developed by a Netherlands based company - www. printunlimited. nl/newsletter/ 2007 _ 01 _en. html). The research also looked at the integration of eco digitally printed fabric with a vintage garment, {{in the form of}} linings, to give it a second life. It continues previous research themes by continuing to attempt to design a ‘future antique’ - here incorporating it into a vintage garment - to create a sophisticated item of high quality. The intention is that the wearer will cherish and keep the artefact, giving a longer life to this couture piece. The outcome for this research was a fashion collection that was exhibited at the ‘Ever & Again’ exhibition in October 2007, at the Triangle Gallery, London, alongside other renowned eco design practitioners such as Rebecca Earley (UK) and Natalie Chanin (USA).

30|$|Biomaterials {{that are}} aimed at {{providing}} replacement for tissues and organs damaged or lost {{as a consequence of}} disease, aging, or accident, play a more and more important role in tissue engineering (Du et al. 2009). Natural bone is a complex inorganic and organic nanocomposite material, in which about 70 wt.% of hydroxyapatite (Hap) nanocrystals and about 30 wt.% of collagen fibrils are well organized into a hierarchical architecture over several length scales (Du et al. 2000; Fan et al. 2010). In recent years, tissue engineering has revolutionized the direction of research for orthopedic applications because of the success of nanotechnological advancements in creating fabrication techniques for nanoscale materials, such as nanofibrous scaffolds by electrospinning (Wei et al. 2011; Woo et al. 2003). Bioactive ceramics, such as Hap and bioglass, are widely used as bone substitute materials as they can bond directly to living bone (Marcolongo et al. 1997). Hydroxyapatite possesses higher mechanical strength and better stability, which is used for tissue engineering during the last two decades. Synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) have good mechanical and biocompatibility properties; however, they lack hydrophilic properties and cell affinity (Venugopal et al. 2005). Silk fibroin is a typical fibrous protein that has recently been studied as a scaffold for tissue engineering because of its excellent biocompatibility, bio-absorbability, and low level of inflammatory potential (Altman et al. 2003; Wei et al. 2011; Meinel et al. 2005; Panilaitis et al. 2003). Regenerated silk fibroin obtained from mulberry (Bombyx mori) silk is the most extensively characterized silk fibroin with outstanding biocompatible properties, and its composite with hydroxyapatite has a high osteoconductivity (Weng et al. 1997; Furuzono et al. 2000; Ren et al. 2007). In the earlier studies, regenerated mulberry silk fibroin and Antheraea pernyi silk fibroin were used to synthesize hydroxyapatite-mineralized fibroin for bone tissue engineering. The <b>wild</b> <b>silks</b> such as tasar, eri, and muga have been used as a textile material for a long period. The major amino acid (glycine, alanine, and serine) composition of eri silk (84.26 %) is higher than that of mulberry (82.8 %), muga silk (67.77 %), and tasar silk (72.06 %). The moisture recovery of the eri silk fibroin is higher than that of mulberry silk and muga silk (Sen and Murugesh Babu 2000 ilk fibroin (Li et al.). The tripeptide sequence of arginine, glycine, and aspartic acid is higher in mulberry s 2008). The study on the comparison of mulberry silk with eri silk showed that cell attachment, binding, and spreading of L 6 fibroblast cells on the eri silk scaffold were better than those on the mulberry silk fibroin, and cell viability was found to be better on eri silk fibroin scaffold (Muthumanickkam et al. 2012 a,b). The aim of the present study is to (1) develop hydroxyapatite-coated eri silk fibroin (ESF-Hap) scaffold by alternate soaking of ESF scaffold in CaCl 2 and Na 2 HPO 4 and (2) to assess the physical and chemical properties, blood compatibility, cell attachment, and cell viability of the pure ESF and ESF-Hap scaffolds.|$|R

40|$|Silkworm cocoons are {{biological}} {{composite structures}} protecting the silkworms against environmental damage and physical attack by natural predators. In particular, some outdoor reared silk cocoons exhibit outstanding mechanical properties {{that are relevant}} to the higher level protection required to enhance the survival chance of silkworms while supporting their metabolic activity. The performance of composite materials strongly depends on the adhesion between the fiber reinforcement and matrix, with the surface properties of the fibers playing a key role in determining the level of adhesion achieved. For this reason it is important to study the surface properties of silk fibroin to further understand the composite properties of the cocoons. In this work, both the mechanical properties of the silk cocoons and silk fibroin were studied. The surface topography was examined using scanning probe microscopy (SPM), which revealed distinct longitudinal ridges and striations along the fiber axis of the four silk fiber types. The fibers were found to exhibit heterogeneity in surface energy as evidenced from inverse gas chromatography (IGC) measurements. The combination of excellent mechanical properties and the more energetically heterogeneous surface nature of the <b>wild</b> A. pernyi <b>silk</b> fibroin fibers correlates well with the excellent mechanical properties of the A. pernyi cocoons.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} behind natural silk spinning by integrating rheology, spectroscopy and small angle scattering {{to better understand}} this process and to guide our efforts towards mimicking Nature’s ways of producing high performance fibres. As a result of natural selection, arthropods such as spiders and moths have evolved the ability to excrete silk proteins in a highly controlled manner. Spun from liquid feedstocks, silk fibres are used ex vivo to build structures with mechanical properties currently unmatched by industrial filaments. As yet, relatively {{little attention has been}} directed to the investigation of spinning under biologically relevant conditions. To better understand how and why silk is spun, this thesis bridges the gap between liquid silk flow properties and structure development. To directly connect the two, I have developed and deployed novel experimental platforms that combine infrared spectroscopy and small angle scattering with rheology. This approach has clarified long-standing ambiguities on the structural root of silk’s apparently complex flow properties. Small angle scattering revealed the length scales involved in the flow induced solidification under a range of spinning conditions. Mo reover, infrared spectroscopy offered a unique perspective into silk’s formation process immediately after excretion. In a similar manner to the post-extrusion tuning of the properties of partly solidified spider silk filaments, this thesis has revealed that silkworm silk fibres are far from completely formed once excreted. One might describe the filaments of mulberry silkworm as seeded molten polymers that form its hydrogen bonding network and crystallises slowly on site. Consequently, it enlightens that post-spinning conditions are equally paramount for silkworm silk, giving an explanation for the relatively poorer mechanical properties. The comparison of silks from a range of species, allowed this hypothesis to be extended to <b>wild</b> silkworm <b>silk.</b> My insights into spinning had the fortuitous repercussion of facilitating silk fibre solubilisation leading to the development of better artificial silk feedstocks flowing like native silks. With these findings, I believe we are now in an improved position to conceive artificial fibres with properties rivalling those of Nature. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Spider silk is a {{material}} of extraordinary beauty and utility. From the spider's perspective, it is foremost a building material, {{but also a}} safety net, a sensory organ, a weapon. From a human perspective, it is {{a material}} of extraordinary mechanical properties, an object of artistic and cultural interest, and a valuable window into the evolutionary history of spiders. Historically, {{there have been a}} mere handful of spider silk textiles, the most recent example of which was constructed by Simon Peers and Nicholas Godley. This was an extravagant work of art, and the silk was collected entirely by hand. Though the finished article {{is a testament to the}} beauty of spider silk, it also illustrates the technical challenges associated with obtaining it in any significant quantity. The effects of this scarcity are evident in the lab of David Kaplan at Tufts University. His group has developed a wide variety of applications for silk, but has focused mainly on silkworm silk in spite of spider silk's greater variety and superior mechanical properties. In the <b>wild,</b> spiders use <b>silk</b> for everything from weaving webs and capturing prey to breathing underwater. Shaped by almost every environment on Earth, spider silk has evolved into endless variations and permutations, offering a vast wealth of material knowledge if we can find a way to tap it. A visit to Cheryl Hayashi's spider silk genetics lab at the University of California, Riverside offers a look inside a spider and a glimpse of how genetic research can illuminate the evolution of silk. At the same time, it puts the limits of our knowledge into stark relief. The scarcity of natural spider silk has helped to drive a small industry in bioengineered and synthetic silk research, and also motivated projects that seek to apply the structural principles of silk fibers to other materials. But so far, these efforts are only a pale imitation of the real thing. For now, the spider is keeping her secrets. by Gillian S. Conahan. Thesis (S.
