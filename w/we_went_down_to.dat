2500|$|Steinway and {{his circle}} of touring and transplanted European musicians {{comprised}} Lüchow's core clientele {{during the early}} years. A pre-sailing farewell engagement at Lüchow's {{in honor of the}} pianist Ignaz Paderewski – which lasted six hours – is noted by The New York Times in 1906. James Huneker, writing for the Times in 1919, describes how he was called upon in the 1890s to introduce Antonín Dvořák – who is referred to [...] as [...] "Old Borax" [...] – to New York society by founder of the National Conservatory Jeanette Myers Thurber, who had engaged the composer to lead her nascent musical institution: [...] "Later <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Gus Lüchow's. For a musician not to be seen at Lüchow's argued that he was unknown in the social world of tone." [...] Huneker aslso relates several anecdotes about Oscar Hammerstein, another Lüchow's habitué.|$|E
60|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> dinner, I asked Uncle Chipperton how his lung {{had stood}} it, {{through all this}} exposure.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Colonel Sahib himself. Not {{in those}} many words, but plainly {{enough for one}} who is not {{altogether}} a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the te-rain when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Lucknow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that lean, bent old man trudges {{after that}} heavy blade of iron pulled {{by a couple}} of horses while <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> eat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (O Mother--O Sisters dear! [...] If we are lost, no victor {{else has}} destroy'd us, [...] It is by {{ourselves}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> eternal night.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I’ll {{give him}} another half-hour, then," [...] said the girl, calmly. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the cabin? It’s rather chilly up here now." ...|$|R
60|$|Kraft {{spent his}} puny store of coin {{at the bar}} and then gave Judkins and me such an {{appealing}} look that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last dime we had in toasting our guest.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> tea at the rest-house, where Stanley stuffed {{himself with}} {{sardines}} and raspberry jam, and beer, and cold mutton and pickles, when Garm wasn't climbing over him; and then Vixen and I went on.|$|E
6000|$|On {{reaching}} the deck <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the cabin, where Jack threw himself, {{in a state}} of great dejection, on a couch; but the teacher seated himself by his side, and laying his hand upon his shoulder, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice way to fix things, all right. What {{do you say}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Jack Elder's {{and have}} a game of five hundred this afternoon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps they did," [...] Jake owned, grinning. [...] "Anyhow, we'll {{have some}} more, with {{a lump of}} ice in it, before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> lunch." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{left the}} room. 'Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{the shore and}} see what the night is like?' said Ethelberta. 'This is the last {{opportunity}} I shall have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{unlikely}} person," [...] Aynesworth remarked smiling. [...] "Do you remember, when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Tredowen {{just before we}} left for America, a little, long-legged, black-frocked child, whom we met in the gardens--the organist's daughter, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naida is a {{wonderful}} woman," [...] Nigel declared enthusiastically. [...] "We lunched at Ciro's. She wore {{a black and white}} muslin gown which arrived this morning from Paris. Afterwards <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Ranelagh and sat under the trees." ...|$|E
60|$|After our repast <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{the river}} {{together}} and bathed {{our hands and}} faces, and then after drinking our fill {{went back to the}} cave. Without a word I crawled into the farthest corner and, curling up, was soon asleep.|$|E
60|$|KEEGAN [springing up actively]. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{the road}} and meet the car? [She gives him her hand and he helps her up]. Patsy Farrell {{told me you were}} expecting young Doyle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will have}} to do so, Hallett. It is good for you, and stirs you up; and I shall risk that onslaught you spoke of, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the coast again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not enough," [...] said Scott, {{who took}} his fishing rod from the pegs in {{the wall of the}} shack. [...] "Well, shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the river? The trout ought to rise to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa! Where is he? I don't {{remember}} him since <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Armstrong's. Yes, I do though!' she paused, 'but I can't think of it. Crying would be worse. What a queer thing fainting is! I used to speculate {{what it was}} like.' ...|$|E
60|$|And he was right. When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{the wharf}} the next morning, {{to find the}} Oclawaha boat, the first persons we saw were Mr. Chipperton, {{with his wife and}} daughter. They were standing, gazing at the steam-boat which was to take us on our trip.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{it was the}} Captain who awakened me, not I the Captain, {{saying that}} {{daylight}} was on the break and we had better be stirring. So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Store, where I was thankful to find that everything had been tidied up in accordance with my directions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Watkins, {{you may as}} {{well take}} the helm for a spell, while <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> lunch. I am not sorry to give it up for a bit, for it has been jerking like the kick of a horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! my dear boy, {{do try to}} {{exercise}} patience. If I tell you everything before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> our comrades, I fear we shall have {{to send a message}} to say that we are not coming till to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think there}} is a good deal to say,' he replied quietly. 'We have to arrange when it will suit you to leave this. I should propose that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco and take the steamer to Panama and go {{straight}} home from there.' ...|$|R
60|$|August 30.--The weather scarce {{permitted}} us more licence than yesterday, yet <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Lochore, and Walter and I perambulated the property, {{and discussed}} {{the necessity of}} a new road from the south-west, also that of planting some willows along the ditches in the low grounds. Returned to Blair-Adam to dinner.|$|E
60|$|Two {{days later}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Vallejo to the trial. I {{had to go}} along as a witness, {{and it was the}} most hateful task that I ever {{performed}} in my life when I testified on the witness stand to seeing Demetrios catch the two salmon Charley had captured him with.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} all was clear. Dick {{came to my}} room and tried to keep me in bed, but I refused to stay. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> breakfast, and sat at a table with Jim and Hiram. It seemed to me that I could not answer any {{questions}} till I had asked a thousand.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, Tom, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{the river}} and have a swim?" [...] {{proposed}} Sam, the next morning. It was an unusually hot day, {{and the thought of}} getting into the cool water of the old swimming hole appealed strongly to the youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two months more!" [...] {{said the}} Duke. [...] "Two months certainly. But even two months will come <b>to</b> an end. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Matching quietly,--very quietly,--when the time does come. You must promise that you'll come with us. Eh? I {{make a point}} of it, Mr. Finn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘There {{is surely}} no offence, my friend,’ {{returned}} Mr. Archer, as {{they shook hands}} across the table; ‘for, believe me, my sympathies are quite acquired to you. This life is an arena where we fight with beasts; and, indeed,’ he added, sighing, ‘I sometimes marvel why <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it unarmed.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Winter {{made the}} {{necessary}} arrangements and after dinner <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the water front. The ship's boat {{was waiting for}} us and we rowed out. The schooner was anchored some way across the harbour, {{not far from the}} breakwater. We came alongside, and I heard the sound of a ukalele. We clambered up the ladder.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a splendid}} morning; and Dan turned up, to my surprise--though I {{might have known}} that when he says a thing, he does it. John Ford came out {{to shake hands with}} him, then, remembering why he had come, breathed loudly, said nothing, and went in again. Nothing was to be seen of Pasiance, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the beach together.|$|E
60|$|After a time <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the cellar. Neither of us seemed {{disposed}} to resume digging, {{and when he}} suggested a meal, I was nothing loath. He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism glowed. He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Bordeaux, <b>we</b> {{have only}} to wait till the Henriette comes in. Possibly she may be there when we arrive. In that case, I am sure that Lefaux {{will be willing to}} take us out, and either put us on board a British cruiser, or land us in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is surely}} no offence, my friend," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Archer, as {{they shook hands}} across the table; [...] "for, believe me, my sympathies are quite acquired to you. This life is an arena where we fight with beasts; and, indeed," [...] he added, sighing, [...] "I sometimes marvel why <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> it unarmed." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Lennan {{reached his}} rooms again after that {{encounter}} with the Ercotts, he found in his letterbox a visiting card: [...] "Mrs. Doone" [...] "Miss Sylvia Doone," [...] and on it pencilled the words: [...] "Do come and see us before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Hayle--Sylvia." [...] He stared blankly at the round handwriting he knew so well.|$|R
