5|$|At Doncaster, {{the king}} awaited Montagu, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north raising a {{substantial}} force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king {{has been called}} 'decisive'. The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|Daltrey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year above, {{had moved}} to Acton from Shepherd's Bush, a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and {{discovered}} gangs and rock and roll. He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site. In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept {{a close eye on}} the finances as well as the music.|$|E
5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in {{his return to the}} National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Naco valley.|$|E
5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and now it has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E

5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job.

5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E

5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of organising another rebellion.|$|E

5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal {{attack on the}} counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded {{to give it to}} Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E

Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
