500|$|The {{game was}} {{shown at the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997, {{alongside}} [...] At the show, the team detailed early plans to include missions. The game was well received, and Combatsim praised it as [...] "the next level in civilian flight sims". Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World liked the game, but he questioned Looking Glass's decision {{to compete in the}} civilian rather than the combat flight simulator market. That August, Looking Glass merged with Intermetrics, a technology company that hoped to branch into the video game industry. The merger came amid financial difficulties; {{a large portion of the}} Looking Glass staff was laid off during the middle of 1997. Looking Glass's Tim Stellmach and Paul Neurath described the merger as amicable, and the former noted that [...] "through the <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> everyone was really psyched about both The Dark Project and Flight Unlimited II". In September, Eidos took over publishing duties on Flight Unlimited II, as a result of Looking Glass's new business model with Intermetrics. The game was released on December 12, 1997.|$|E
500|$|The track next {{appeared}} on the set list for Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, as the closing song. Joined by a choir and singer Cee Lo Green, Madonna in a black robe sang as the stadium was lit with white light. It was also added to the set list for The MDNA Tour the same year. Performed in a gospel version, Madonna and 36 of her back-up singers {{played the role of}} a choir and wore long robes, as images of a gothic church and Hebrew letters {{appeared on}} the backdrops. Jim Harrington from The Oakland Tribune gave the overall concert a negative review but stated that [...] "It wasn't until the last two songs—"Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Celebration"—that the <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> finally clicked". Timothy Finn from The Kansas City Star was particularly impressed with the backing choir, calling it [...] "the best use of one since Foreigner's 'I Want to Know What Love Is". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the pretext}} that the {{supposed}} loan and issuance would be politically unpopular, {{and with the}} implication {{that it was a}} bit of sharp practice by bank insiders, the entire operation was conducted in an atmosphere of deep secrecy. [...] It was vital, Reis emphasized to his contractors from Lisbon, that the matter be kept quite confidential to avoid embarrassing their prominent silent partners and risking the <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> being scotched in the face of political opposition.|$|E

2500|$|The phonological loop (or [...] "articulatory loop") as a <b>whole</b> <b>deals</b> {{with sound}} or phonological information.

5000|$|On {{the themes}} of the album, Stump {{expressed}} that [...] "Soul Punk is less a cohesive narrative as one piece and more individual pieces that dissect a few themes. The album as a <b>whole</b> <b>deals</b> with greed and paranoia and how the two influence each other. The record also deals a bit with innocence and death." ...|$|R
2500|$|As the band's career progressed, Hüsker Dü {{emphasized}} melody in its songs. Unlike other hardcore bands, Hüsker Dü did not disavow classic rock. [...] "You {{know the}} <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> with tearing down the old {{to make room}} for the new?" [...] Hart posited. [...] "Well, music isn't city planning." [...] The band covered 1960s hits like Donovan's [...] "Sunshine Superman" [...] and The Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] early in its career. As the band members progressed as musicians, they discovered they were able to play at slower tempos while still maintaining the rhythm, allowing for extended melodies.|$|E
2500|$|Krekar {{told the}} Kurdish {{magazine}} Awene {{that he wants}} to return to Iraq to fight openly against the Iraqi government and the coalition, but that he lacked travel documents from the Norwegian government. He confirmed to a Norwegian newspaper that he had been correctly quoted. The Norwegian minister of labour and migration, Bjarne Håkon Hanssen, responded that Krekar could leave at any time and that he would be given [...] "travel documents within the day. He'll also get money for airline tickets, taxi cab, and the <b>whole</b> <b>deal.</b> If he really wants to go, that is." [...] Krekar is still living in Norway.|$|E
2500|$|After {{congress}} {{voted in}} favor of removing López Obrador from immunity, López Obrador asked for leave from his post for a few days. President Vicente Fox, wanting to avoid a political cataclysm, and knowing that the decision made by the congress was against the will of millions of people, appeared on national TV in April 2005, indicating that the issue would not be pursued any longer. The <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> ended up closed on a technicality, and López Obrador, though without immunity, was not prosecuted (and thus remained eligible to compete in the presidential election). A few weeks later, [...] Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha resigned.|$|E

She hears that Jamie has someone locked {{in the trunk of}} his campaign car, a witness who accidentally overheard Jamie, Ames and Chief Jackson earlier that night. Ames says that {{he is not going to}} be a part of the current events and calls off the <b>whole</b> <b>deal.</b> He insists that he will not leave his wife and start a new company if it requires him to kill someone. As Ames and Jamie continue arguing, Terry quietly goes to the campaign car and shifts it into [...] "drive." [...] The car rolls into the lake and slowly submerges as Rosie screams.|$|E
2500|$|Support for the Arab Peace Plan {{was also}} {{expressed}} by Andre Azoulay, a Jewish adviser to Moroccan King Mohammed VI. On October 28, 2008, Mr Azoulay {{said at a}} conference in Tel Aviv that: [...] "I am a Jew with a commitment," [...] said Andre Azoulay. [...] "I'm an Arab Jew. I advise the king of Morocco... The Arab mainstream sees Israel as the party responsible for preventing peace, not the Arabs.... is something that the Israelis hoped for ten years ago. But who knows about it in Israel today? Who will take the initiative and explain it? The momentum will not last forever. This is a dangerous situation.

2500|$|After the 1960 season, the American League {{announced}} plans to put a team in Los Angeles. [...] Greenberg immediately became the favorite to become the new team's first owner and persuaded Veeck to join him as his partner. [...] However, when Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley got wind of these developments, he threatened to scuttle the <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> by invoking his exclusive rights to operate a major league team in southern California. [...] In truth, O'Malley {{wanted no part of}} competing against an expansion team owned by a master promoter such as Veeck, even if he was only a minority partner. [...] Greenberg wouldn't budge and pulled out of the running for what became the Los Angeles Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). [...] Greenberg later became a successful investment banker, briefly returning to baseball as a minority partner with Veeck when the latter repurchased the White Sox in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The <b>whole</b> <b>deal</b> is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E
2500|$|Texas oil tycoon Clint Murchison Jr. {{was having}} a {{difficult}} time bringing an NFL team to Dallas. In 1958, Murchison heard that George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, was eager to sell the team. Just as the sale {{was about to be}} finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms. Murchison was outraged and canceled the <b>whole</b> <b>deal.</b> Around this time, Marshall had a falling out with the Redskin band director, Barnee Breeskin. Breeskin had written the music to the Redskins fight song, now a staple at the stadium. [...] He wanted revenge after the failed negotiations with Marshall. He approached Tom Webb, Murchison's lawyer, and sold the rights for $2,500. [...] Murchison then decided to create his own team, with the support of NFL expansion committee chairman, George Halas. Halas decided to put the proposition of a Dallas franchise before the NFL owners, which needed to have unanimous approval in order to pass. The only owner against the proposal was George Preston Marshall. However, Marshall found out that Murchison owned the rights to Washington's fight song, so a deal was finally struck. If Marshall showed his approval of the Dallas franchise, Murchison would return the song. The Cowboys were then founded and began playing in 1960.|$|E

Further, the critical view on functioning of international organizations is brought. The thesis is divided into two parts; each of them consists of four chapters.
