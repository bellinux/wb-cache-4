40|$|ABSTRACT. As {{a part of}} a {{study and}} {{analysis}} on the effects of process para-meters on weld bead volume in sub-merged arc welding (SAW) of pipes, mathematical models were developed to relate the process parameters and the weld bead quality parameters. Further, the optimization of weld bead volume was carried out using the optimization module available in the MATLAB version 4. 2 b software package. The mathemati-cal models thus developed for optimiza-tion are also helpful in predicting the weld bead quality parameters and in set-ting process parameters at optimum val-ues to achieve the desirable weld bead quality at a relatively low cost {{with a high degree of}} repeatability and increased production rate. Total volume of the weld bead, an important bead parameter, was optimized (minimized), keeping the di-mensions of the other important bead pa-rameters as constraints, to obtain sound and superior quality welded pipes. Sen-sitivity analysis was also carried out to predict the direct and few interaction ef-fects of important bead parameters on the total volume of the weld bead, and the results are presented in graphical form. The results of the sensitivity analy-sis are very useful in understanding the interdependence of various weld bead quality parameters in controlling the vol-ume of the weld bead, to improve weld quality, to increase productivity with the available <b>welding</b> <b>facilities</b> and to mini-mize the total welding cost...|$|R
40|$|Control of the Gas Metal Arc {{welding process}} is {{becoming}} increasingly sophisticated, due to improvements in technology and {{a better understanding of}} the process itself. To effectively conduct research in this area, it is necessary to have equipment that is extremely flexible in both architecture and operation. Experimental power sources and a <b>welding</b> test <b>facility</b> have been developed at the University of Wollongong which meet these criteria. The core time-critical control functions are performed by an independent digital signal processor (DSP). Non time-critical functions such as data storage and operator interface are performed by a desktop personal computer. Both computing platforms are readily programmable, allowing a variety of control strategies to be tested merely by changing software. Welding current is supplied to the process using a custom-built electronic power source with very high dynamic response and rapid current turn-off. The electrode feeding is accomplished by a bidirectional wire feed unit with a time constant of approximately 2 milliseconds. Visualisation of the welding process is achieved through the use of a CCD camera and high-power xenon flash unit, which are both synchronised to process events by the DSP controller. The construction of the <b>welding</b> test <b>facility</b> is modular, allowing for upgrading of submodules as technology improves.

40|$|In Europe and Japan {{there exist}} several {{companies}} which are qualified to fabricate superconducting cavities for accelerator application. Two different technologies are used: Niobium sputter coating of copper cavities or e-beam welding from solid Niobium. The first technology {{was used to}} fabricate the cavities for the LEP accelerating unit at CERN. These cavities are operated at an accelerating gradient up to 7 MV/m. At higher accelerating gradient cavities made from solid Niobium show a better performance. The required gradient of 23 MV/m at a quality factor of 1 x 10 ^ 10 could be demonstrated with many 9 -cell cavities (1. 3 GHZ) operated at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF). These cavities are fabricated from solid Niobium. Stringent vacuum requirements must be meet during welding the Niobium parts. Furthermore the Niobium parts must be handled with great care not to contaminate the later inner surface of the cavity. These conditions result in considerable effort during fabrication. Development of complex tools or installation of specialized e-beam <b>welding</b> <b>facilities</b> are too costly for the fabrication of {{only a small number}} (less than 100) of cavities.

High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of <b>welding</b> <b>facility.</b> The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two finish coat systems was also studied. These finish coats were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. Finish coat system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear coat, and finish coat system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of finish coats, the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding finish coats better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both finish coats presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the factors influencing the resistance upset butt welding process to obtain {{an understanding of the}} metal behaviour and welding process characteristics, so that new automotive steels can be welded with reduced development time and fewer failures in production. In principle the welding process is rather simple, the materials to be joined are clamped between two electrodes and pressed together. Because there is an interface present with a higher resistance than the base material, heat will be generated at the joint position once the welding current and voltage are applied. As soon as the material is warm and soft enough, an extra (upsetting) pressure is applied and a weld is formed. For making wheel rims, after welding, the upset is removed by means of chisels and shear cut- ting the edges of the weld, followed by rolling the remaining material into the rim. After the upset has been removed the wheel rim is cold formed in several steps to its final shape. For the {{purpose of this}} research 2. 0 mm thick S 460 MC and 1. 65 mm thick HR 45 steel were examined at a test <b>welding</b> <b>facility</b> at Fontijne Grotnes BV. Both steels were specially developed for cold forming and deep drawing purposes and have a mainly ferritic microstructure. An initial research into the crack formation in wheel rims during production was performed, proving that there were no hard and crack susceptible microstructures present in the weld area of the researched materials. The idea that the wheel rims crack due to for example to the presence of bainite and martensite was rejected. There were two main types of cracks discovered, large cracks which are formed due to initial misalignment of the sheets, grease and/or oil at the interface during welding and an uneven heat distribution during welding. The other type of cracks were micro-cracks, which originate from notches introduced during the trimming and rolling of the wheel rim edges after welding. A good alignment of the chisels and cutting tools is necessary to minimise the amount of material that is pushed into the wheel rim Because it was not feasible to do welding experiments in a full wheel rim welding machine at a production facility, the Fontijne Holland Welderr was employed, this is a scaled down version of a production welding machine, but without the material feed or post weld handling facilities. During welding it was observed that the weld sample did not heat up evenly, the emitted light at the interface was brighter at some places than at others. Also after welding the oxidation of the joint area showed that there was a non-uniform heating, with warmer and colder areas. This non-uniformity results in non-uniform weld characteristics and weld quality differences over the length of the weld. Tensile tests of samples taken both from the edges and the centre of welded samples showed that the maximum tensile strength can be as high as 95 % of the tensile strength of the base material. However, the strain to failure of the welded samples was only a maximum of 60 % with a 30 % difference between the central test sample and the edge samples. Erichsen testing was also employed to provide an indication of weld quality. Only the centre of samples was tested due to the way the Erichsen tester is constructed. The Erichsen height was upto 85 % of the base material height for the welded samples and it was found that if there are no edge defects present, the Erichsen test is a quick and valid weld quality test. Due to observed non-uniform weld quality and heating of the weld area, the focus of the research shifted to understanding why there was a non-uniformity present. Temperature measurements both by thermal camera and thermocouples showed that there is indeed a non-uniform temperature distribution present during welding over the joint interface. The outer edges of the joint line have higher temperatures than {{the central part of the}} weld. Local difference can be as high as 300 K over just 20 mm distance. Also there are hot spots present at either end of the joint line approximately 10 mm from the edges. These hot spots can give rise to local melting in steels with low melting temperature segregation bands. The causes of the uneven temperature distribution were sought. Employing local current measurements during welding was not possible, however when the welding process is just started and there has been no signifcant heating of the weld sample, it is possible to link the voltage distribution directly to the current density distribution. Measuring voltage distributions is relatively easy, voltage probes were spot welded to the surface of the weld samples and measurements showed that there was a non- uniform voltage distribution present during welding. This non-uniformity had the same distribution as the temperature distribution, low voltages at the places were the temperatures were low and high voltage signals where the temperatures were high. Because the non-uniform voltage distribution was measured for both 1 and 2 -piece samples (samples with and without an interface) it can be concluded that the boundary conditions governed by the welding equipment have a major influence. The influence of the clamping system and the contact surface of the electrodes were researched to determine their its influence on the heating of the weld area. It was shown that the clamping pressure of the samples was not high enough to prevent slip of the samples during welding and that the samples had to be positioned in the centre of the electrodes to minimise non-uniform heating. At the places of the highest local pressure, the contact resistance is the lowest and heating will consequently be slower at those locations. The highest edge temperatures were measured at the far end of the electrodes, where the lowest clamping pressures are expected. To obtain more uniform heating it is necessary to obtain a more uniform current distribution. This can be accomplished by changing the contact interface between the electrode and the sample surface or the interface between the weld samples. Adapting the electrodes has a small influence but will also result in longer welding times due to a decrease in contact surface area (decrease of 10 % results in a 5 % increase in weld time). The interface change can decrease the welding time by up to 20 % due to a local faster initial heating. Unfortunately the change in interface surface resulted in less repeatable welds. Residual stress in the welded samples was also examined. Both samples with the upset present as well as samples where the upset was removed were measured. The samples with the weld present showed tensile stresses at the centre of the joint line, but compressive stresses at the edges of the sample. When the upset was removed the overall stress state of the sheet became more neutral, the compressive and tensile stress peaks become lower. The stress distribution was explained conceptually with the aid of a modified bar model. Modelling with both MS. Marc and ABAQUS was employed in this research to obtain a better understanding of the complex electrical, thermal and mechanical relationships as observed during real experiments. Three different models were developed, a thermal model, a thermo-mechanical model and a local strain model. The local strain model showed that the Erichsen testing method is a valid method for weld quality assessment. The modelled total strain observed during flaring of wheel rims was lower than the modelled and measured strain during Erichsen testing. Both the thermal and thethermo-mechanical models are predictive. The first one is based on input parameters directly coming from measurements during welding experiments. The thermo-mechanical model is based on the temperature dependent material parameters. The initial thermal model was designed to determine if the non-uniform current density distribution, as measured during experiments, could result in a non-uniform heating of the weld area. The model did not include any temperature dependent parameters nor a mechanical coupling. This showed that the non-uniform current input resulted in a non-uniform heating of the sample. By obtaining a more uniform current distribution over the length of the joint area, a more uniform heating can be obtained. It was also indicated that around contaminations at the interface, either conductive or insulating, a locally higher temperature exists. The mechan- ical model is a more realistic model as it includes the upsetting force. The model predicts the formation of the upset when there are misalignments of the sheets during welding. Because this model includes the temperature dependent material parameters, it is possible to predict the residual stresses after welding, which are in qualitative agreement with the measured residual stresses in real welds.

This is where the cryogenic piping system is remotely monitored and controlled. Other important sites at D 0 include the trailer city on the north parking lot, which has the D 0 secretary who handles all the payroll matters (among other duties), and the portakamp in the south parking lot. Besides D 0, which is named for its location on the particle accelerator ring. the most important place is Wilson Hall. That is the large building shaped like a big Atact symbol. It contains various important people such as the safety group. the personnel department (which you have already encountered. being hired), the minor stock room, the cafeteria, the Fermi library. Ramsey Auditorium. etc. Behind Wilson Hall is the Booster Ring, which accelerates particles before they are injected into the main ring. Inside the booster ring are the East and West Booster towers, which contain cryogenic support groups. The D 0 cryo group offices used to be in the West Booster Portakamps. Away from Wilson Hall, there are various buildings strewn about the Fermilab property that have important functional uses to D 0. One such example is Lab A. This is where the now unused bubble chamber resides. which was used to take pictures of particle motion. Many of our group is from the bubble chamber, and occasionally stories from the 'bubble chamber days' can be heard as someone waxes nostalgic. Lab A has a machine shop and many technicians. All three of the cryostats used in the D 0 experiment went through Lab A for preparation and installation work. Lab A is located directly up the road from the front of Wilson Hall (north-east). Its unmistakable dark geodesic dome makes it easy to find. The Feynman Computer building, located east and just a little bit north of Wilson Hall, houses the computer repair people. If any of the computers used in our group crash and burn, we must take them to the third floor of Feynman to be fixed or exchanged. On one side is the Prep department, which handles the VAX mainframe computers, and on the other is personal computer repair, which handles Fermi Macs and IBMs. Directly north of Wilson Hall is Site 38. This site is the location of many important Fermilab facilities, such as the Fermi fire department, the carpenter's shop, the Fermi gas pumps, the main stock room, and shipping and receiving. Lastly, but perhaps most significantly, is the Fermilab Village. In addition to the machine shops, the cut shop, <b>welding</b> <b>facilities,</b> and the garishly painted physicist dorms, there are such things as a gym, a pool and other facilities to take the edge off a weary mind. The village is located just north off Batavia road on the east side of Fermilab. The village barn is the first and most notable building as one approaches...|$|R
