5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded large tracts {{of land in the}} <b>west</b> <b>that</b> provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which laid the foundation for the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into the <b>west,</b> <b>that</b> the Swiss army as a whole was mobilized a second time. At the onset of the campaign, German military aircraft first violated Swiss airspace.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Oceanside, Long Island, New York by his mother after his father died. Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was {{instrumental}} in starting Troop 1 of Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910. Troop1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed Chief Scout Executive James E. <b>West</b> <b>that</b> he asked the troop to serve as honor guard for the visit of Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for the troop to travel to New York harbor for Baden-Powell's arrival {{in the morning of}} January 31, 1912. Baden-Powell inspected Troop1, and spoke with Eldred at some length. It is uncertain how Baden-Powell found out that Eldred's Board of Review was that afternoon, but he ended up attending it and being part of the Board of Review.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the <b>West</b> <b>that</b> excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of campaigns he {{recovered}} the provinces of Jazira, Thughur and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids {{in the east and}} the Tulunids in the <b>west</b> <b>that</b> secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph's lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested in natural sciences, renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.|$|E

5|$|Some of Palairet's {{early success}} can be {{attributed}} to his father, who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell, both later Wisden Cricketers of the Year, to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, and it was in the south <b>west</b> <b>that</b> he chose to play his cricket. On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended Oriel College, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, most of legislative Route5 north of Oneonta—including the section between Richfield Springs and Mohawk—became part of NY28, which originally began in Oneonta and headed north through Richfield Springs and Mohawk before ending in Utica. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the section of NY28 between Richfield Springs and Mohawk was moved onto a new highway to the <b>west</b> <b>that</b> went directly between the two locations. The portion of its former routing between Richfield Springs and Paines Hollow became part of the new NY167, which continued north from Paines Hollow to Dolgeville via Little Falls and old legislative Route37.|$|E
