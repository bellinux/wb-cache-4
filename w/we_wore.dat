500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what <b>we</b> <b>wore,</b> where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E

2500|$|She also enlisted costume {{designer}} Arianne Phillips {{to create the}} dresses for the film. The costumes designed were a combination of real vintage pieces, others were remade based on patterns that were obtained out of the museum archives, and the rest had to be freshly made. In an interview with W magazine in November 2011, Philips explained that she [...] "started doing research in 2009, a year before [...] began filming... To me, Wallis Simpson was a style icon, but I didn’t know she was a couture client well before she met Edward. She was also a hungry whore for jewelry. Edward gave Wallis jewelry {{to make her feel}} royal. My first task was figuring out how to re-create those famous gifts." [...] Madonna had sent a box of her research to Phillips, so that the designer could get a head start for the project. The singer understood the kind of attention to detail needed to create the costumes, drawing from her own garments which included couture. Phillips then researched the clothes on display at fashion departments of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She then went to Los Angeles, where retailer Doris Raymond, from The Way <b>We</b> <b>Wore</b> had opened up her personal library of 1930s couture. There Phillips watched old newsreels from the University of California archives. Once filming started, the designer moved in Madonna's guesthouse in London, where they would watch the shot reels together and scrutinise the dresses. Phillips established contacts with designer labels like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels to replicate a cross bracelet and ten other pieces. For the gowns, undergarments, and dresses needed for the 60costume changes in the film, Phillips scoured the archives of Vionnet and Schiaparelli; then with the cooperation of both houses she redesigned Simpson's clothing. The first dress in which Riseborough appeared as Simpson in the film was a re-creation of the dress owned by Simpson herself. Phillips decked the dresses with diamond bow brooch at the neck and paired with organza skirts, and was able to obtain duplicates for some of them from Cos Prop, a costume shop in London.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, while Song {{carried the}} long-abandoned and now-reinstituted titles of Left Prime Minister (左丞相, Zuo Chengxiang) and Da Shitu (大師徒, a more {{magnified}} {{form of the}} title of Situ, one of the Three Excellencies) in the new Southern Tang administration, he was not given real responsibilities. [...] He became so displeased that when an imperial edict was read out loud, honoring him referred to him as [...] "Our friend from when <b>we</b> <b>wore</b> civilian clothing," [...] he loudly replied, [...] "When your subject was wearing civilian clothing, Your Imperial Majesty was a prefect; now that Your Imperial Majesty is the Son of Heaven, you no longer need this old subject." [...] After making the comment, he went home and expected punishment. [...] Emperor Liezu issued another edict thanking him but not giving him additional responsibilities. [...] Unsure {{what to do to}} regain the emperor's trust, he submitted petitions requesting that Yang Pu (whom Emperor Liezu continued to honor as a retired emperor and allowed to live at the palace in Guangling, while Southern Tang's capital was set at Jinling (i.e., Sheng Prefecture)) be moved out of Guangling and be given a lesser title, so that people would not be tempted to rebel to restore Wu, and that the marriage between Emperor Liezu's daughter Princess Yongxing and Yang Pu's son Yang Lian the Duke of Hongnong (the former crown prince) be severed. [...] Emperor Liezu did not accept either proposal. [...] When Song again objected in 938 that, as Left Prime Minister, he should be allowed to participate in the governance, Emperor Liezu gave the excuse that the office building had not been built yet. [...] Meanwhile, apparently accepting one of Song's ideas after all (and with Yang Pu himself being uncomfortable remaining at Guangling as a former emperor), Emperor Liezu moved Yang Pu and the former Wu imperial family from Guangling to Run Prefecture and put them under secure guard. [...] Still, when Song subsequently again complained about being separated from the emperor by wicked people, Emperor Liezu became publicly angry, causing Song to again return to his home to wait for punishment. [...] When others spoke on his behalf, Emperor Liezu commented, [...] "Song Qiqiu is talented but does not know what is appropriate." [...] He sent Xu Jingtong (whose name would soon thereafter be changed to Li Jing by this point and who had, as the emperor's oldest son, been created the Prince of Wu, as Emperor Liezu had himself restored his birth name of Li in order to claim legitimate succession from Tang Dynasty, apparently under a suggestion initially made by Song) to Song's mansion to recall him to the government, and Song subsequently returned. [...] Subsequently, Emperor Liezu accepted another suggestion of Song's — that when a Khitan emissary arrived, the emissary was treated with great honors, {{but as soon as the}} emissary headed north, back across the Huai River (i.e., now in Later Jin territory), assassins were sent to kill him, so that the killing could be blamed on Later Jin. [...] It was said that this incident did bring frictions between Later Jin and Khitan (whose aid was critical in Later Jin's establishment). [...] Meanwhile, it was also at Song's proposal (although apparently a proposal driven by Emperor Liezu himself) that when Emperor Liezu established the seven imperial ancestral temples, while most of the temples were dedicated to Emperor Liezu's biological Li ancestors, Emperor Liezu's adoptive father Xu Wen was given one of the three most honored temple positions (and given the temple name of Yizu), along with Tang's first two emperors Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong.|$|E
