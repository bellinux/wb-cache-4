The biological richness of which are fish that have a benefit {{in the field of}} food and health. Tunafish (Euthynnus affinis) is a species that is very interesting to study both in terms of nutritional composition and in terms of its economy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the nutrient content and chemical compounds contained in red meat and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> <b>tuna.</b> Research methodology includes observation of morphology, proximate analysis and phytochemical analysis of tuna. The highest yield was found in meat that   50 %. Proximate protein content of the highest in the white meat that was 68. 36 %, the highest fat in red meat was 5. 6 %, the highest in red meat ash 3. 29 %, and the highest water on the white meat that was 12. 16 %.

The aims of this study were to examine the effect of metalâ€“catalyzed oxidation concentration CuSO 4 / H 202 on the formation of carbOnyl protein, loss of protein solubility and protein denaturation in red and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> of <b>White</b> <b>Tuna</b> (Thunus sp). The result indicated that the formation of carbonyl protein offish protein was influenced by types of meat and metal-catalyzed oxidation concentration CuSO 4 /H 202. 1, 02. The higher the concentration Cu 504 / H 20 ? the higher increased the carbonyl protein product in both <b>white</b> and red <b>meat.</b> Formation of carbonyl protein was also increased with the storage time. However, the increase of carbonyl protein of red meat is higher compare with the <b>white</b> <b>meat.</b> Counter post the existence of hidroxyl radical produced from metal-catalyzed oxidation apparently leads to the modification of secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, in turn affect to the protein solubility and protein denaturation. The percentage of loss of protein solubility in red and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> were 28. 74 â€“ 45. 31 % and 23. 13 â€“ 34. 50 % respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the extent to}} which dietary {{preferences}} are altered by making aspects of the symbolic meaning of meat salient to participants. Individuals in the treatment group were informed of a previous scientific study which found that people who endorse social hierarchy and human dominance over nature consume more red and <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> and that people who reject hierarchy and dominance eat more fruits and vegetables. The results showed that, compared to a control group, individuals in the treatment group who reject hierarchy and dominance (most participants) perceived red and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> less favourably, decreased their liking of red and <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> decreased their object identification with red and <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> anticipated that they would eat more fruits and vegetables in the subsequent three days, and indeed consumed more fruits and vegetables in a follow-up study three weeks later. Moreover, the salience manipulation's ability to induce a negative response toward red and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> and greater acceptance of fruits and vegetables was strongest for individuals in the treatment group for whom the salience manipulation made sense, individuals with less confidence in their diet choices, those who had previously considered reducing their meat consumption, and low/normal weight persons.

40|$|Human {{population}} {{studies show}} that dietary red and processed, but not <b>white,</b> <b>meats</b> are associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer but dietary fibre appears to be protective. We examined whether dietary cooked red or <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> had differential effects on colonic DNA damage in rats and if resistant starch (RS), a dietary fibre component, provided protection. Rats were fed diets containing approximately 15, 25 or 35 % of cooked beef or chicken, both with or without 20 % high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) {{as a source of}} RS, for 4 weeks. DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) were measured in isolated colonocytes (by comet assay) along with apoptosis levels, colonic mucus thickness and large bowel short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Both red and <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> increased colonocyte SSB and DSB dose dependently but damage was substantially greater with red meat. Dietary HAMS prevented these increases. Apoptotic cell numbers were increased dose dependently by red meat irrespective of HAMS feeding, whereas <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> only increased apoptotic cell numbers in the presence of HAMS. Red meat induced greater colonic mucus layer thinning than <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> but HAMS was protective in both cases. HAMS induced increases in large bowel SCFA, including butyrate, and significantly lowered concentrations of phenols and cresols. We have demonstrated that dietary red meat causes greater levels of colonic DNA SSB and DSB than <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> consistent with the epidemiological data. Dietary RS protects against this damage and also against loss of the mucus barrier, probably through increased butyrate production. Shusuke Toden, Anthony R. Bird, David L. Topping and Michael A.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} mercury and selenium distribution in different portions (exoskeleton, <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> and brown meat) of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). Some samples were also analysed as whole specimens. The same portions were also examined after boiling, in order to observe if this cooking practice could affect mercury and selenium concentrations. The highest mercury concentrations were detected in <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> exceeding in all cases the maximum levels established by European legislation. The brown meat reported the highest selenium concentrations. In all boiled samples, mercury levels showed a statistically significant increase compared to raw portions. On the contrary, selenium concentrations detected in boiled samples of <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> brown meat and whole specimen showed a statistically significant decrease compared to the corresponding raw samples. These results indicate that boiling modifies mercury and selenium concentrations. The high mercury levels detected represent a possible risk for consumers, and the publication and diffusion of specific advisories concerning seafood consumption is recommended. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
