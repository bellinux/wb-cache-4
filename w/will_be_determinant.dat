The IP (Internet Protocol) has become an unprecedented agreement in the telecommunications industry for the transformation of its traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telecommunications Network) infrastructure. While this infrastructure transformation is under way, another huge challenge is service innovation: to change the way the traditional telecommunications operators create, integrate and deliver new services.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing has {{provoked}} controversy regarding its still questionable risks and benefits. The {{safety and performance}} of such devices, when entering the European market, are currently regulated by the Directive 98 / 79 EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. In September 2012, a new Regulation was proposed to replace this Directive and the legislative process is still ongoing. This article presents the main points of the European Commission’s proposal for the new Regulation and the subsequent amendments voted by the European Parliament, aiming to evaluate the potential contribution of the proposal for a more effective regulation of DTC genetic testing in Europe. In this regard, the proposal seems to enhance the current regulatory framework by further elucidating {{the scope of the}} Regulation and by establishing a risk-based classification system that guarantees increased pre-market scrutiny of the tests. Furthermore, the proposal attempts to establish higher safety and performance requirements and to enhance transparency. In addition, the European Parliament introduced amendments according to which appropriate genetic counseling is required in the context of genetic tests and such tests are classified as prescription only, banning, at the same time, their DTC advertising.

Such decision rules would be useful to winegrowers in their effort to homogenize the nitrogen status within a plot.

Recently, a vehicle-mounted optical sensor, Multiplex®, was introduced to estimate the nitrogen status of grapevine leaves. The measuring principle of this proximal sensor is based on chlorophyll fluorescence screening. The aim {{of the present study was}} to correlate nitrogen contents at harvest to the Nitrogen Balance Index (NBI) measured with the Multiplex on leaves. Multiplex measurements on leaves were recorded for each main stage during the growing seasons 2010 and 2011 on Plumecoq (Chouilly, France), the experimental vineyard of the Comité Champagne (CIVC).

This was long considered a profound limitation for the enforcement of humoral immune responses against HIV- 1 infection, especially since these neutralizing Abs (nAbs) are extremely difficult to induce. However, increasing evidence shows that additional non-neutralizing Abs {{play a significant role}} in decreasing the viral load, leading to partial and sometimes even total protection. Mechanisms suspected to participate in protection are numerous. They involve the Fc domain of Abs as well as their Fab part, and consequently the induced Ab isotype <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determinant</b> for their functions, as well as the quantity and quality of the Fc-receptors (FcRs) expressed on immune cells. Fc-mediated inhibitory functions, such as Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, aggregation, and even immune activation have been proposed.

An improved in-depth characterization of the Abs displaying these functional responses is required for the development of new vaccination strategies, which aim to selectively trigger the B cells able to induce the right functional Ab combinations both at the right place and at the right time.

Cork is the ideal material for suberin extraction because of its suberin content (≥ 40 %) and availability in industrial quantities. Suberin is a polyester made of glycerol and long-chain α,ω-bifunctional fatty acids, mainly C 18 ω-hydroxyacids and α,ω-diacids with mid-chain substituents, either an unsaturation, an epoxide or a vic-diol group. The objective of this work was twofold: to develop techniques to isolate the main suberin acids from cork in preparative quantities and high purity (≥ 99. 5 %); and to develop spectroscopic techniques, namely NMR-based, to unambiguously assign the stereochemical configuration of the C 18 suberin acids. The multi-step process developed comprised suberin depolymerization and suberin acids separation in solvents of contrasting polarities and tempera-tures, followed by successive purification by normal-phase LC and reversed-phase HPLC. The C 18 : 1 suberin acids were proved to be cis, through the analysis of their olefinic and allylic proton and carbon chemical shifts, and coupling constants extracted by spectra simulation. A NMR technique was developed using the chemical shifts of the benzylidene acetal derivatives of vic-diols, proving that the suberin acids C 18 9, 10 -epoxyacids were cis, and the C 18 9, 10 -diol acids were threo, in both cases present as racemic mixtures.

However, how the level of cell surface expression of a given Ly 49 receptor and its ligand affinity influence {{the strength of the}} inhibition signal is not well documented. To address this issue, we developed a series of human Jurkat T-cell transfectants expressing the whole range of Ly 49 A and Ly 49 C levels found in vivo on natural killer and T cells and evaluated their capacity to alter superantigen-induced NF-AT activation and interleukin- 2 production. We show that the strength of the inhibition induced by Ly 49 A/H- 2 Dd interaction correlates with Ly 49 A density up to a certain level after which increasing expression does not further inhibit significantly the T-cell receptor-induced activation. This system also represents a valuable tool for the determination of the relative strength of the inhibitory signals of Ly 49 receptors following their interactions with different ligands. Even at high levels of expression {{there was no evidence that}} engagement of Ly 49 A with H- 2 b class I molecules provided an inhibitory signal. Moreover, we showed that functional inhibitory interactions of Ly 49 C with H- 2 b class I molecules were only the result of H- 2 Kb and that H- 2 d represent lower affinity ligands for Ly 49 C than H- 2 b. Therefore, depending on the relative affinity of Ly 49 receptors for their ligands, the modulation of their expression level <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determinant</b> for the functional outcome of activated T cells...|$|E

Water quality models coupled to hydrodynamic models are these tools. This study presents the application of the water quality model WASP coupled to the hydrodynamic model DYNHYD for two distinct reservoirs: Lake Texoma and Tocoma Reservoir. Modeling the former included simulations of water velocities, water level, and four chemical and physical compounds: chlorides, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS); and validation of the results by comparing with observed values during March - May, 1997. The latter is still under project status and the simulation was performed in a prospective way. The analysis included simulations of water velocities under current and for expected conditions, DO and BOD. Both models, DYNHYD and WASP, fitted pretty well to observed conditions for Lake Texoma and for where Tocoma Reservoir has been planned. Considering management and decision support purposes, the role of boundary and loading conditions also was tested. For Lake Texoma, controlling boundary conditions for chlorides is a determinant factor for water quality of the system. However, DO and TSS in the reservoir are governed by additional process besides the condition of the boundary. Estimated loadings for this system did not provided significant effects, even though the allocation of a load for chlorides resulted in significant changes in the trend for expected chloride concentrations at the Washita River Arm of Lake Texoma. For Tocoma Reservoir, the expected concentration of DO all over the reservoir is going to driven by boundary conditions, {{as well as by the}} management of autochthonous BOD loadings provided by vegetation decomposition.

40|$|Although quite {{a number}} of {{applications}} of spatial solitons can be envisaged, the main application is their use as a dynamic optical interconnection. Depending on the speed at which the optical interconnection can be redirected from one output to another, different possibilities arise. If the switching time is in the order of a second, then typically only reconfigurable interconnects are possible, e. g. protective switching (when one optical path fails, the optical signal is switched to a backup optical path). More interesting is the use as high speed optical modulators, but then typically switching times in the order of a nanosecond are necessary. It is clear that the switching speed <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determinant</b> for which application solitons can be of practical use, but in general one can state: the faster the switching speed, the better. In this Chapter, when we speak about switching time, we refer to the time that it takes for the soliton to form when the optical beam is switched on. For applications as reconfigurable interconnects, the switching time is actually {{the time it takes to}} switch the optical signal from one output to another, but since this is much harder to describe theoretically, we stick to the simpler problem of switching on (or off) the soliton beam. Obviously, the temporal behavior of the soliton will be determined by the optical nonlinearity used for the soliton formation and different nonlinearities are important in liquid crystals with completely different typical timescales. Therefore, in the first part of this Chapter we will give an overview of the behavior of the two most important optical nonlinearities in liquid crystals, namely the reorientational and the thermal nonlinearity. The other nonlinearities will be summarized briefly. In the second part, results for the soliton formation time will be presented for the reorientational nonlinearity...|$|E

The present goal is towards Carbon Neutral Growth (CNG) by 2020 and 50 % reduction in net CO 2 emissions over 2005 levels by 2050. There are not easy alternatives to liquid fuels for airplanes; therefore, biofuels are necessarily part of the solution. However, the specifications for jet biofuel rule out ethanol and biodiesel, the most common biofuels in the market. There are several routes {{for the production of}} aviation biofuel allowing the use {{of a wide range of}} biomasses. The conversion and refining technology pathways <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>determinant</b> for the choice of feedstock. At present, most jet bioluel tested in airplanes are derived from oils, but not taking into account conversion technologies, the best options to start an aviation biofuel industry in Brazil are sugarcane, eucalyptus, and soybean, of the sugar, cellulose, and oil crop groups. The main reasons are the established production chains, high yields, competitive prices, and possibility of greenhouse gases abatement. Other crops may be feasible options depending on specific regional conditions, further agronomic improvements, and cost reduction. Taking as reference the energy content of ethanol, around 30 Mha of land would be necessary to supply sugarcane to meet 50 % of the present global consumption of jet fuel. This is less than the 64 Mha of land suitable for sugarcane in Brazil, mostly replacing pasture and without using environmentally sensitive areas. This area may be less as biomass yields increase and the energy of other plant parts is more efficiently used. The opportunity costs of final products derived from the biomass feedstock may place the price of the energy of jet bioluel above that of the fossil jet fuel. Appropriate public policies and tax treatment may be necessary to stimulate an emerging aviation bioluel industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
