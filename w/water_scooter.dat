5000|$|A {{personal}} {{water craft}} (PWC), also called <b>water</b> <b>scooter,</b> jetski, and comically a boatercycle, is a recreational watercraft that the rider sits or stands on, rather than inside of, as in a boat.

The second style is a [...] "stand up", where the rider uses the watercraft standing up.

50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>scooters</b> - as {{they were}} {{originally}} termed - were first developed in the United Kingdom and Europe in the mid-1950s, with models such as the British 200cc propellor-driven Vincent Amanda, and the German Wave Roller. Two thousand Vincent Amandas were exported Australia, Asia, Europe and the United States. In the 1960s, the idea was developed further by Clayton Jacobson II of Byron Bay, Australia. Originally a motocross enthusiast, Jacobson's idea was designed in the mid-1960s, powered by an internal pump-jet rather than an outboard motor, made of all aluminum, and had a fixed, upright handle. Jacobson eventually quit his job in banking to devote himself to developing the idea, and had a working prototype by 1965. It differed slightly from modern personal watercraft but had definite similarities. He completed a second prototype a year later made of fiberglass.The first Clayton-type PWC to reach the market was designed by Bombardier in the late 1960s. Bombardier's original designs were not very popular and Bombardier left the business before 1970.|$|R
