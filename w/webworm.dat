5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} {{ailanthus}} as food, including the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the host plant for the ailanthus <b>webworm</b> (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|E
25|$|Although abundant, few {{species in}} this {{subfamily}} are of economic importance. Even the fall <b>webworm,</b> an abundant and highly polyphagous tree-feeding species that has spread from North America to Asia and Europe, {{does not do}} lasting damage to healthy hosts.|$|E
25|$|The fall <b>webworm</b> (Hyphantria cunea) is a moth in {{the family}} Erebidae known principally for its larval stage, which creates the {{characteristic}} webbed nests on the tree limbs {{of a wide variety}} of hardwoods in the late summer and fall. It is mainly an aesthetic pest and is not believed to harm otherwise healthy trees. It is well known to commercial tree services and arboriculturists.|$|E
40|$|The term “sod webworm” {{refers to}} an insect complex of more than twenty {{different}} grass-infesting species. Adult sod <b>webworms</b> are pyralid moths, but are more {{commonly referred to as}} “snout moths” because their mouthparts are projected forward (Fig. 1). Sod <b>webworms</b> are distributed through the U. S., and at least seven different species occur in Utah (Table 1) ...|$|R
50|$|To be {{considered}} a serious infestation of sod <b>webworms,</b> 12 larvae must {{be found in a}} 0.1 m2 area. To test this, hollow pans are placed with a pyrethrum or detergent drench and allowed to sit for 10 minutes, then the larvae in the area are counted. During peak growing periods, the grass will often be able to recover by itself and not show serious damage. For high-end turf that cannot show any damage or serious infestations, predators of the sod <b>webworms</b> must be attracted, including birds and insect predators, such as ground beetles, robber flies, and predatory wasps. The larva is also prone to infection from microorganisms such as Beauveria bassiana and Nosema (Microsporidia). Parasitic nematodes such as Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis can also infect sod <b>webworms.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the most frequent unfavorable natural phenomena in the Republic of Moldova, such as drought, hot dry-winds and strong winds, dust storms, hail, frost, glaze ice, invasion of sod <b>webworms</b> and others. Additionally it presents a number of methods for reduction of their damaging influence {{on the results of}} agricultural activity. The article showcases the devastating effect of <b>webworms</b> on the seeding of agricultural crop yield in 1975 and the coping measures undertaken in those years. In 2003, {{as a result of an}} unusual combination of natural and climate factors, a great damage was done to the seeding of agricultural crops. Similarly, abnormal heat during the summer of 2007 caused a disastrously low crop yield on the territory of the republic...|$|R
25|$|Dolichovespula arenaria {{workers are}} known to mostly feed on live {{arthropods}} {{of a wide variety}} such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, spiders, flies, lacewings, and even lady beetles (which are generally avoided by Vespula species). They also prey on larvae of the fall <b>webworm,</b> as well as young hummingbirds. In general, they are not attracted to protein baits. Occasionally, however, Dolichovespula may feed on animal carcasses— such feeding has been observed on carcasses of a dog, pig, and snake. They are commonly seen to prey in higher trees (2–4 m).|$|E
25|$|V. maculifrons is a {{polyphagous}} species, {{meaning that they}} feed {{on a variety of}} foods. The number of trips a worker makes to forage depends on the age of the worker, as well as the size of the nest, since more food is necessary to feed a larger nest. Workers dedicated to foraging are capable of olfactory learning, allowing them to distinguish odors specific to food. Workers use this ability to scavenge for dead insects such as earwigs and fall <b>webworm</b> larvae, as well as live arthropods. They are also frugivores, obtaining carbohydrates from fruits, nectar, and honeydew. Workers go to flowers in an attempt to catch insects, but often end up feeding on nectar and pollinating the flower while doing so. They feed on honeydew, which is a sweet, sticky liquid. However, honeydew is susceptible to fermentation, causing individuals that feed on it to become inebriated and unable to fly or walk. Since this species is attracted to sugar sources, they may be attracted to soft drinks or other foods consumed by humans. Adults feed larvae with a chewed paste made from other insects and carrion.|$|E

50|$|Sod <b>webworms</b> have a bivoltine {{life cycle}} with four stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago (adult). They overwinter as larvae {{in their final}} or {{penultimate}} instar in the thatch or soil. With the coming of warmer weather, the larvae will pupate, and moths will appear in late spring or early summer. The first generation of eggs is laid in June, with larvae appearing in June and lasting until July. Adult moths appear from July until August. Under favorable conditions, a second generation will occur, with the adult stage laying eggs in early October.|$|R

The five females in the series, all from Lexington (three collected on 19 June and two collected on 5 July), were not identified.

50|$|The blackpoll has a {{deliberate}} feeding style with occasional flitting, hovering and hawking around branches. They are primarily insectivorous. The species {{appears to be}} quite a generalist, preying on a great diversity of adult and larval insects and spiders. Documented insect prey for the species includes lice, locusts, cankerworms, mosquitoes, <b>webworms,</b> ants, termites, gnats, aphids and sawflies. It has been suggested that this species may be a spruce budworm specialist, but there is no obvious connection between population trends of the two species. The blackpoll will opt for berries in migration and during winter. They often forage high in trees, and sometimes catch insects while in flight.|$|R

50|$|Invasive gypsy moths {{may also}} serve as an {{important}} food source for black-billed cuckoos. Most birds cannot consume gypsy moth caterpillars because of their hair-like setae however, cuckoos can consume them because {{of their ability to}} shed their abdominal lining. During outbreak years of these insects, the abundance of black-billed cuckoos increased on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes. This increase is not due to higher reproductive rate because then the black-billed cuckoo populations would only increase the next year. The abundance is higher because the cuckoos flock towards the outbreak areas. This is supported by the fact that cuckoo abundance is actually lower than average in the areas surrounding the outbreaks, suggesting a large influx of the birds towards outbreaks. They are able to find these areas due to post-migratory nomadic behavior. Once reaching their breeding ground, they search vast expanses of forest for the most suitable breeding area, in this case, where there is an abundance of food. Similar patterns have also been observed during outbreaks of tent caterpillars, fall <b>webworms</b> and cicadas.|$|R
50|$|Since crambids are {{relatively}} common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (Niphograpta albiguttalis), {{used to control}} its host (Eichhornia crassipes), the water veneer (Acentria ephemerella), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil), and the bamboo borer (Omphisa fuscidentalis), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption (see entomophagy). The mint moth (Pyrausta aurata) {{is an example of}} a harmless crambid. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the spotted stalk borer (Chilo partellus), the Asiatic rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), sod <b>webworms</b> (Crambus spp.), Duponchelia fovealis, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), bean pod borers (Maruca spp.), the rice white stemborer (Scirpophaga innotata), the southwestern corn borer (Diatraea grandiosella), and the grape leaffolder (Desmia maculalis).|$|R
