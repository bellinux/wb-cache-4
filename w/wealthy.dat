5000|$|Geography {{and wealth}} {{have long been}} {{perceived}} as correlated attributes of nations. The continents along the equator, Africa and India, are the poorest. Even within Africa and India this effect can be seen, as the nations farthest from the equator are <b>wealthier.</b> In Africa, the <b>wealthiest</b> nations are the three on {{the southern tip of}} the continent, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, and the countries of North Africa. Similarly, in South America, Argentina, Southern Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay have long been the <b>wealthiest.</b> Within Asia, Indonesia, located on the equator, is among the poorest. Within Central Asia, Kazakhstan is <b>wealthier</b> than other former Soviet Republics which border it to the south, like Uzbekistan. [...] The <b>wealthiest</b> nations of the world with the highest standard of living tend to be those at the northern extreme of areas open to human habitation--including Northern Europe, the United States, and Canada. Within prosperous nations, wealth often increases with distance from the equator; for example, the Northeast United States has long been <b>wealthier</b> than its southern counterpart and northern Italy <b>wealthier</b> than southern regions of the country.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but {{they began to}} rely heavily upon {{commercial}} exchanges with the <b>wealthy</b> landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants subsequently fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying tenants of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential nobles, landowners, and merchants. The government tried to limit the power of these <b>wealthy</b> groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BC severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed <b>wealthy</b> landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The <b>wealthy</b> landlords eventually dominated commercial activities as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants—upon whom the government relied for tax revenues, military manpower, and public works labor. By the 180s AD, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.|$|E
