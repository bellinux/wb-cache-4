30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to frame a model that will help the {{retailer}} to determine the optimal replenishment policy for non-instantaneous deteriorating items. The supplier offers a permissible delay in payments with two levels of storage facilities. Our model suits well for the retailer in situations involving unlimited storage space. Thus, the decision maker can easily determine whether it will be financially advantageous to rent a warehouse to hold much more items to obtain a trade credit period. It was assumed that the rented <b>warehouse</b> <b>charges</b> are higher holding cost than the owned warehouse. To reduce the inventory costs, it will be economical to consume the goods of the rented warehouse at the earliest. From the results obtained, we see that the retailer can reduce total annual inventory cost by ordering lower quantity when the supplier provides a permissible delay in payments by improving storage conditions for non-instantaneous deteriorating items. Incorporating more realistic assumptions such as allowable shortages, probabilistic demand, or quantity discounts, this article paves way to extend future research works.|$|E

We provide another insight into the nature of the membership fee using a model of price competition between a warehouse club and a supermarket. We show that the warehouse club’s membership fee is an optimal competitive reaction to the supermarket’s promotional activity. The more frequent the promotion is, the lower is the membership fee. However, the larger the promotion depth is, the higher is the fee. Our analysis not only provides a justification of warehouse club membership fees but also gives managers several guidelines on yearly fee and retail price decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{involves}} {{developing new}} mathematical expressions to find reorder point and order quantity for inventory management policies that explicitly consider storage space capacity. Both continuous and periodic reviews, {{as well as}} backlogged and lost demand during stockout, are considered. With storage space capacity, when on-hand inventory exceeds the capacity, the over-ordering cost of storage at an external <b>warehouse</b> is <b>charged</b> on a per-unit-period basis. The objective is to minimize the total cost, consisting of ordering, shortage, holding, and over-ordering costs. Demand and lead time are stochastic and discrete in nature. Demand during varying lead time is modeled using an empirical distribution so that the findings {{are not subject to}} assumptions of demand and lead time probability distributions. Due to the complexity of the developed mathematical expressions, the problems are solved using an iterative method. The method is tested with problem instances that use real data from industry. Optimal solutions of the problem instance are determined by performing exhaustive search. The proposed method can effectively find optimal solutions for continuous review policies and near optimal solutions for periodic review policies. Fundamental insights about the inventory policies are reported from a comparison between continuous review and periodic review solutions, as well as a comparison between backlog and lost sales cases...|$|R

"'I {{forgot to}} say {{that as soon as}} Shirley began to talk about the dead man and his gold, I left the <b>warehouse</b> in <b>charge</b> of Maka, and took him to my hotel, where he told me the rest of his story in a room with the door locked. I must try to take as many reefs in what {{followed}} as I can. I don't believe that the finding of the gold made any difference in their plans, for, of course, it would have been foolish for them to try to get to us by themselves. They cut the blanket in half and made up the gold into two packages, and then they started back for the mountains, taking with them all the provisions they could carry in addition to the gold, and leaving their guns behind them. Shirley said their loads got heavier and heavier as they ploughed through the sand, and it took them three days to cover the ground they had gone over before in two. When they got to the village, they found scarcely a man in the place, for the fellows who had deserted them were frightened, and kept out of sight. They stayed there all night, and then they went on with their bundles to the next village, where they succeeded in getting a couple of travelling-bags, into which they put their gold, so that they might appear to be carrying their clothes.|$|R
30|$|In some {{practical}} situations, when suppliers offer price discounts for bulk purchases or {{the products are}} seasonal, the retailers may purchase more goods than {{can be stored in}} his/her own warehouse (OW). Therefore, a rented warehouse (RW) is used to store the excess units over the fixed capacity W 1 of the own warehouse. Usually, the rented <b>warehouse</b> may <b>charge</b> higher unit holding cost than the own warehouse due to additional cost of maintenance, material handling, etc. To reduce the inventory costs, it will be economical to consume the goods of RW at the earliest. Consequently, the firm stores goods in OW before RW, but clears the stocks in RW before OW. Hartely (1976) was the first author to consider the effect of a two-warehouse model in inventory research and developed an inventory model with a RW storage policy. Then Lee and Ma (2000) discussed an optimal inventory policy for deteriorating items with two-warehouse and time-dependent demand. Yang (2004) presented a two-warehouse inventory model with constant deteriorating items, constant demand rate and shortages under inflation. Lee and Hsu (2009) developed a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items with time-dependent demand. Yang (2012) analyzed two-warehouse partial backlogging inventory models with three-parameter Weibull distribution deterioration under inflation. Bhunia et al. (2014) discussed a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items under permissible delay in payment with partial backlogging. Tiwari et al. (2016) developed a two-warehouse inventory model for non-instantaneous deteriorating items and they explored the role of trade credit and inflation on the optimal policy. Xianhao et al. (2017) compared the different dispatching policies in two-warehouse inventory systems for deteriorating items over a finite time horizon.|$|R

In 1966 the court in Hagen sentenced Wolf to eight years in prison for his role as an overseer of a slave labour commando that sorted the belongings of victims already [...] "processed". Wolf, in his work as the <b>warehouse</b> clerk, was <b>charged</b> with personally killing one Jew and with helping to murder an additional 115,000 Jews. He was found guilty of having assisted in the murder of [...] "at least 39,000 Jews", a number chosen arbitrarily for judicial purposes. Sentenced to eight years in prison, Wolf, age 58 (at the time of his arrest), likely served at least a part of the sentence. This is all that is known about him, other than he lived somewhere in Bavaria. His brother, SS-Scharführer Josef Wolf, was killed in the Sobibór uprising.|$|R

When Spider arrives, Muggs orders the other boys to leave the room. Claiming that he was dishonorably discharged, Muggs then tells Spider that he wants to join the hijackers, and Spider confides that Fingers pays him to unbolt the back door to the warehouse. As Muggs and Spider leave the clubhouse for the night, Spider admits to Muggs that the only reason he took up the job with the crooks was in order to have money {{to take care of his}} ill mother. Meanwhile, Fingers had overheard Spider's earlier confession and, once Spider is alone, drags him back to the clubhouse and beats him to death.|$|R
40|$|Industrial parks {{have played}} an {{indispensible}} role in boosting economic and industrial development. However, further {{development has been}} impeded by the shortage of land resources and by duplicate investments on common physical assets and services. This thesis proposes the concept of Supply Hub in Industrial Park (SHIP) as a public provider of warehousing and transportation services shared by manufacturing enterprises located within an industrial park. This research investigates four typical scenarios. The first scenario explores SHIP’s storage capacity pooling effect. Inventory models are built to simulate the supply chain in a typical industrial park: with and without SHIP. Under demand variations, two rules are presented for SHIP’s space allocation: the proportional dispatching rule (PDR), and the backorder cost priority dispatching rule (BPDR). The simulation {{results show that the}} industrial park can benefit from SHIP’s storage capacity pooling especially under complementarily seasonal or identically volatile demand pattern. BPDR is more beneficial than PDR to the industrial park, SHIP, and the manufacturer with the largest backorder cost rate. The second scenario evaluates SHIP’s value in consolidating shipments via numerically comparing the supply chain with SHIP with the traditional one. Genetic algorithm is used to solve the models developed for the two supply chains. Numerical outcomes show that the industrial park can obtain significant cost savings from applying SHIP. The cost reductions increase with the size of the supply chain, the vehicle capacity, and the rates of fixed transportation cost and holding costs of finished products at manufacturers. The third scenario investigates SHIP’s storage pricing strategies. A bilevel model is proposed to optimize SHIP’s decision on storage pricing, and individual manufacturer’s decisions on replenishment and delivery. A dynamic storage pricing depending on the storage length is adopted. The bilevel model is solved in closed-form in special cases. Through numerical experiments, SHIP is found to gain more profit by using the dynamic storage pricing than the constant one. It is observed that SHIP could not gain profit improvement by raising its delivery charge. Contrary to intuition, SHIP attracts more space demands from large production-scale manufacturers when charging higher on delivery or when the public <b>warehouse’s</b> delivery <b>charge</b> is lower, and more demands from small manufacturers when the market storage price is lower. The fourth scenario discusses how SHIP and manufacturers interact to optimize their decisions on shared transportation pricing and cycle-time, and raw material delivery schedules. A bilevel model is proposed to study this problem. The theoretical analysis of the model indicates that the SHIP’s storage price is the key in determining each partner’s behaviour. For comparison, a bilevel analytical model is constructed for direct transportation. The numerical outcomes show that SHIP’s profit may not always increase with the vehicle capacity. Manufacturers make more delivery orders when SHIP charges a significantly high storage price or the holding cost rate at manufacturers is significantly low. Sharing transportation service may bring benefits to SHIP and manufacturers with large demands. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
