5000|$|Alex also learns {{from the}} First Lady that Zoe doesn't have a phone, {{when one of}} Zoe's friends said she did. Interrogating Zoe's friend, he learns someone used her phone to text Zoe to lure {{her out of the}} school - {{possibly}} the kidnapper. He asks Ryan, the bully that picks on Ethan (who earlier got into a fight with Zoe and Ethan), about why he texted her a year ago on a field trip. Ryan shows him the message ("I want to cum on your tits.") but also claims someone else wrote it. It seems that the kidnapper uses the phones from different kids to contact Zoe. Alex suspects the killer is the school's janitor after interrogating him, since the janitor runs off. It is later revealed that he's not the kidnapper but has pornographic pictures of children on his computer. Alex later suspects Glass - the school's nurse - is the killer. When asking Glass' wife about Glass, she reveals {{he wanted to be a}} doctor, but after the death of their son, Zach, he got mad and blamed everyone for his death. She also reveals that after a few months, Glass kidnapped her and held her hostage in a basement sort of thing, with food and water. However, he later took her back home, packed his things, left her, and wrote a message saying [...] "sorry." [...] Since he has lost his own child, Glass probably doesn't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to have his. Alex, the FBI, and others watch Glass, who gets away. Alex soon spots him, and wants to arrest him, but fails and loses him again. Ned tells Alex to call him if he needs a favor. Alex calls upon Ned's and Sampson's help. The three drug Glass, tricking him into showing them where the Coyle children are being kept. After finding them, Alex arrests Glass. Ron Burns informs Alex that due to a lack of evidence, Glass will be in jail for a couple of days only. The First Lady, Zoe, and Ethan thank Alex and tell him the kidnapper was male and spoke into a recorder. Alex and Sampson find Glass and arrest him again, with the evidence being the recorder found in the glove compartment of his car. Glass tries to get out his gun and is shot by Alex and Sampson in self-defence.|$|E

500|$|Norma Lois Peterson, in {{her book}} on Tyler's presidency, {{suggested}} that Tyler's general lack of success as president was due to external factors that would have affected whoever was in the White House. Chief among them was Henry Clay, who was determined to realize the vision he had for America, and who would brook no opposition. In the aftermath of Jackson's determined use of {{the powers of the}} Executive Branch, <b>the</b> Whigs <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> to be dominated by Congress, and Clay treated Tyler as a subordinate.

5000|$|Broom carried these {{opinions}} {{with him}} to Philadelphia, where he consistently voted for measures that would assure a powerful government responsive {{to the needs of}} the states.

He also sought to vest state legislatures with the power to select presidential electors, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to hold office for life. Broom faithfully attended the sessions of the Convention in Philadelphia and spoke out several times on issues that he considered crucial, but he left most of the speechmaking to more influential and experienced delegates. Georgia delegate William Pierce described him as [...] "a plain good Man, with some abilities, but nothing to render him conspicuous, silent in public, but cheerful and conversable in private." ...|$|R
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not.

Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even <b>the</b> <b>President)</b> and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution.

5000|$|Madison had a paternalistic {{attitude}} toward American Indians, encouraging {{the men to}} give up hunting and become farmers. He stated in 1809 that the federal government's duty was to convert the American Indians by the [...] "participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state". As President Madison often met with Southeastern and Western Indians who included the Creek and Osage. As pioneers and settlers moved West into large tracts of Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, and Chickasaw territory, Madison ordered the US Army to protect Native lands from intrusion by settlers, {{to the chagrin of}} his military commander Andrew Jackson.

50|$|It was {{originally}} intended for President Eisenhower {{to have a}} more active role in the campaign as he wanted to respond to attacks Kennedy made on his administration. However, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower expressed concern to Second Lady Pat Nixon about the strain campaigning would put on his heart and <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to back out of it without letting him know of her intervention. Vice President Nixon himself also received concern from White House physician Major General Howard Snyder, who informed him that he could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and his health had been exacerbated by Kennedy's attacks. Nixon then convinced Eisenhower not to go ahead with the expanded campaign schedule and limit himself to the original schedule. Nixon reflected that if Eisenhower had carried out his expanded campaign schedule he might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election, especially in states that Kennedy won with razor-thin margins. It was years later before Mamie told Dwight why Nixon changed his mind on Dwight's campaigning.|$|R

50|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume the presidency.

2500|$|Upon {{assuming}} {{office on}} March 4, 1809, {{in his first}} Inaugural Address to the nation, Madison stated that the federal government's duty was to convert the American Indians by the [...] "participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state". Like Jefferson, Madison had a paternalistic attitude toward American Indians, encouraging the men to give up hunting and become farmers. Although there are scant details, Madison often met with Southeastern and Western Indians who included the Creek and Osage. Madison believed their adoption of European-style agriculture would help the Creek assimilate the values of British-U.S. civilization.

50|$|An {{agreement}} was reached involving six draft laws that covered {{an overhaul of the}} Constitution, establishment of a Constitutional Court, the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus). The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system. A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect <b>the</b> <b>president</b> (parliament or <b>the</b> people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). Initially, the opposition was united in <b>wanting</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> elected by parliament after new elections to ensure parliamentary supremacy and minimise the MSzMP’s power. Then, faced with Communist concessions, the relatively weak opposition split, as at least three moderate groups (including KNDP and MDF) signed the Round Table agreement and implicitly accepted Pozsgay as <b>president</b> while <b>the</b> radicals (notably Fidesz and the SzDSz) refused to do so. After a burst of negotiations, fully free elections were scheduled for March 1990, in contrast to the semi-free elections held in Poland in June 1989.|$|R
