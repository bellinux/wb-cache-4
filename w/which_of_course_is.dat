[...] Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has [...] "the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it." [...] According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered [...] "a certain quality of soul" [...] when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison [...] "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{starship}} [...] {{encounters a}} rift in spacetime {{while on a}} routine mission. As they monitor the anomaly, the heavily damaged USS Enterprise-C, a ship {{believed to have been}} destroyed more than two decades earlier, emerges. Instantly, the Enterprise-D undergoes a sudden and radical change from its current timeline: it is now a warship, and the United Federation of Planets is at war with the Klingons. Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to, and Tasha Yar– who was killed years before– is now running the tactical station. None of the crew notice the change, but [...] senses that reality has shifted, and has a meeting with Captain Picard to discuss her concerns. She senses that there are supposed to be children on the ship, <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> completely impractical on a warship. She suggests that the Enterprise-C does not belong in their time and must return to the past.

500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation <b>which,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>is</b> rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also bring out a lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Hückel's rule, if a {{molecule}} has 4n+2 π-electrons, it is aromatic, {{but if it}} has 4n π-electrons and has characteristics 1–3 above, the molecule {{is said to be}} antiaromatic. Whereas benzene is aromatic (6 electrons, from 3 double bonds), cyclobutadiene is antiaromatic, since the number of π delocalized electrons is 4, <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> a multiple of 4. The cyclobutadienide(2−) ion, however, is aromatic (6 electrons). An atom in an aromatic system can have other electrons that {{are not part of the}} system, and are therefore ignored for the 4n+2 rule. [...] In furan, the oxygen atom is sp2 hybridized. One lone pair is in the π system and the other in the plane of the ring (analogous to the C–H bond in the other positions). There are 6 π-electrons, so furan is aromatic.|$|E

2500|$|The Colorado Plateau {{varies from}} the large stands of forests in the west, {{including}} the largest stand of ponderosa pine trees in the world, to the Mesas to the east. Although not called a desert, the Colorado Plateau is mostly made up of high desert. Within the Southwest U.S. region, the Colorado is bordered to the south by the Mogollon Rim and the Sonoran Desert, to the west by the Mojave Desert, and to the east by the Rocky Mountains and the Llano Estacado. The Plateau {{is characterized by a}} series of plateaus and mesas, interspersed with canyons. The most dramatic example is the Grand Canyon. But that is one of many dramatic vistas included within the Plateau, which includes spectacular lava formations, [...] "painted" [...] deserts, sand dunes, and badlands. One of the most distinctive features of the Plateau is its longevity, having come into existence at least 500 million years ago. The Plateau can be divided into six sections, three of which fall into the Southwest region. Beginning with the Navaho section forming the northern boundary of the Southwestern United States, which has shallower canyons than those in the Canyonlands section just to its north; the Navaho section is bordered to the south by the Grand Canyon section, <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> dominated by the Grand Canyon; and the southeastern-most portion of the Plateau is the Datil section, consisting of valleys, mesas, and volcanic formations. Albuquerque is the most populous city within the portion contained in the Southwest region, but Sante Fe, New Mexico and Flagstaff, Arizona, are also significant population centers.|$|E

Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't really gotten down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've got to eat a couple cities before I think the thing will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for Words on a Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..."
