The journalist George Monbiot claimed that the results <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> highlighting earlier findings across the whole of Wiltshire {{that there had been a}} 33% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured generally and a 68% reduction at camera sites during the previous 3 years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{safety of}} red yeast rice {{products}} {{has not been}} established, and some commercial supplements {{have been found to}} contain high levels of the toxin citrinin. As commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins, and rarely declare this content on the label, defining risk is difficult. Ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of [...] "spiking" [...] red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin. As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds. Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage. [...] Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure (renal failure). This is why they are prescription drugs rather than over-the-counter, and with recommendations that the patients' physicians schedule liver function tests on a regular basis. There are many case reports in the literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage. In 2009 Becker et al. reported on a U.S. trial that enrolled 62 patients with known statin-associated myalgias. Half got a RYR product (3600mg/day, 13mg monacolins, 6mg monacolin k) for 24 weeks; and half were administered a placebo. In the treated group, LDL-cholesterol declined 21%. Two patients dropped out because of myalgia, 1 for diarrhea, and 1 for dizziness. In the placebo group, one dropped out for myalgia. Creatine phosphokinase increased slightly in the treated group (from 122 to 128 IU/L) versus decreasing with placebo (117 to 101 IU/L), but the shifts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> For those having completed the trial, subjective muscle pain scores were similar for the two groups. [...] "The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR {{is similar to that of}} statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions." ...|$|E
