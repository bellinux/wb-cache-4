5|$|A {{detachment}} from SeaBee Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7, based at Naval Station Rota, Spain, constructed a United States Africa Command-funded boat ramp and concrete perimeter <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> the Coast Guard, which was handed over in December 2010. In February 2011, the United States turned over two donated USCG Defender class boats to the Coast Guard.|$|E

Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall (as it was in history), {{pointing}} out that now it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning against the <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E
5|$|The civil {{leadership}} of the resistance, represented by lawyer Sven Arntzen, demanded Quisling be treated like any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police.

5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front <b>wall.</b> <b>For</b> some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the Great Wall {{in the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with the Great Wall, and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great <b>Wall</b> <b>for</b> ten days.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the walls in the present church suggests that the <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> {{the length of the}} first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E

One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the service.|$|E
5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> digging the foundation.|$|E

5|$|All 24 tablets of {{the fourth}} row, {{designed}} and manufactured by Royal Doulton, were added as a single batch in August 1908. A single Royal Doulton tablet to PC Alfred Smith was added in June 1919, followed in October 1930 by similar Royal Doulton tablets to three further police officers, and a replacement tablet with the correct details of the East Ham Sewage Works incident of 1895. A single tablet made by Fred Passenger in the original DeMorgan style, honouring schoolboy Herbert Maconoghu, was added in April 1931 {{to fill the gap}} in the centre row left by the removal of the original, incorrect tablet to the victims of the East Ham Sewage Works incident. In 2009 a 54th tablet was added, {{in the style of the}} Royal Doulton tiles, to commemorate print technician Leigh Pitt, the first addition to the <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> 78 years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the tribute}} and a {{negotiation}} between Laoshang Chanyu (r.174–160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r.180–157 BC) to reopen border markets, {{many of the}} Chanyu's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great <b>Wall</b> <b>for</b> additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r.141–87 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids. However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving {{the assassination of the}} Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d.117 BC) and Wei Qing (d.106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> a set distance, either {{to land on}} or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E

5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a <b>wall</b> <b>for</b> too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western <b>Wall</b> <b>for</b> the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest {{date back to the}} days when the Wall was still standing. They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of the building of the <b>Wall,</b> <b>for</b> every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross {{at the scene of the}} event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated on the east side of the Reichstag building.|$|E
