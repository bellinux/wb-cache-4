5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
5|$|After infiltrating the Garden of Death and {{the castle}} where Blofeld spends his time {{dressed in the}} costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is {{captured}} and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands {{in a fit of}} violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, {{while the rest of the}} world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E
2500|$|Rome {{recruited}} many non-native deities, cults and priesthoods as protectors {{and allies}} of the state. Aesculapius, Apollo, Ceres and Proserpina were worshiped using the so-called [...] "Greek rite", which employed Greek priestly dress, or a Romanised version of it. The priest presided in Greek fashion, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head <b>bare</b> or wreathed.|$|R
60|$|Each man's {{work had}} been settled, {{and there was no}} confusion. One of the sailors and Francis stole towards one of the men, while the other and Matteo {{approached}} the second.

5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu {{on a mission to}} Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order to curry favor with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E
60|$|And it {{was such}} a tiny boy after all, and in such a pair of huge boots <b>with</b> holes showing <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> toes. However, they served him to run away from Master Pucklechurch into the furthest ditch, and if the ladies had designs on him, they had to be deferred.|$|R
60|$|It was. But the brawling creek he had swam a {{few hours}} before had risen, more than doubled its volume, and now rolled a swift and resistless river between him and Rattlesnake Hill. For the first time that night Richard's heart sank within him. The river, the mountain, the {{quickening}} east, swam before his eyes. He shut them to recover his self-control. In that brief interval, by some fantastic mental process, the little room at Simpson's Bar and the figures of the sleeping father and son rose upon him. He opened his eyes wildly, cast off his coat, pistol, boots, and saddle, bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders, grasped the bare flanks of Jovita <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bared</b> knees, and <b>with</b> a shout dashed into the yellow water. A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling current, and then were swept away amidst uprooted trees and whirling drift-wood.|$|R
50|$|When Jeff Converse {{is convicted}} of a brutal crime he did not commit, he sees his bright future {{slipping}} away from him. Then, he is suddenly whisked away to a secret underground Manhattan society in with mysterious, twisting tunnels and chambers, where darkness lurks around every corner. He sees the eerie underground group of the homeless and the mad, and realizes {{what he has to}} do. Jeff must now find a way to escape alive from this living hell, <b>with</b> only <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and <b>his</b> wit.|$|R
25|$|The protagonist Beowulf, {{a hero of}} the Geats, {{comes to}} the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel.

25|$|Bonham drum solos {{would often}} feature his playing floor toms and cymbals <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. He started using this {{technique}} {{as well as}} developing a finger-control style, influenced from hearing jazz recordings by drummer Joe Morello, during the early 1960s with his first band the Blue Star Trio.|$|E
25|$|Hera's wrath against Zeus' son {{continues}} {{and while}} Heracles {{is still an}} infant, Hera sends two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttles the snakes <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies {{as if they were}} a child's toy.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the pelting rain again <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head <b>bare,</b> and, bending low over the river, and {{scooping}} up the water <b>with</b> <b>his</b> two hands, washed the blood away. All beyond his figure, as Riderhood looked from the door, was a vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards {{one quarter of the}} heavens. He raised his head and came back, wet from head to foot, but with the lower parts of his sleeves, where he had dipped into the river, streaming water.|$|R
50|$|While {{traveling}} to the 1832 rendezvous at Pierre's Hole, Godin and his party came across trapper Thomas Fitzpatrick, emaciated <b>with</b> <b>his</b> feet <b>bare,</b> and <b>his</b> clothing in shreds, traveling without horse or equipment. Fitzpatrick had been attacked and robbed several weeks earlier by Blackfeet when he had ridden ahead of a pack train to alert the rendezvous of their eminent arrival. Godin brought Fitzpatrick in to the rendezvous {{at a time when}} many had given Fitzpatrick up for dead.|$|R
60|$|And all {{the while}} poor Tom paddled up the park <b>with</b> <b>his</b> little <b>bare</b> feet, like a small black gorilla fleeing to the forest. Alas for him! there was no big father gorilla therein to take his part--to scratch out the gardener's inside with one paw, toss the dairymaid into a tree with another, and wrench off Sir John's head with a third, while he cracked the keeper's skull <b>with</b> <b>his</b> teeth as easily {{as if it had}} been a cocoa-nut or a paving-stone.|$|R
25|$|On January 30, 2014, a {{fisherman}} from El Salvador named Jose Salvador Albarengo {{was found by}} people living at the Ebon Atoll. Albarengo claimed to have spent 13 months adrift after his ship's motor failed {{off the coast of}} Mexico. He said another fisherman sailing with him had died several months before he was rescued. He reportedly survived by eating turtles, birds and fish caught <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands.|$|E
25|$|Leopold Tormes, {{a member}} of the Puerto Rican legislature, told reporters how a {{policeman}} murdered a Nationalist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Dr. José N.

No arms were found {{in the hands of the}} wounded civilians, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward and were later released on bail.|$|E
25|$|Amnesty International {{estimates}} that {{a total of}} {{half a million people}} were killed during the Red Terror of 1977 and 1978. During the terror groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down, and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers. The Save the Children Fund reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa. Mengistu Haile Mariam himself is alleged to have killed political opponents <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands.|$|E
6000|$|Our {{travellers}} {{were in the}} act {{of passing}} a small thicket of trees close by the roadside, when the first living being presented himself whom they had seen since their departure from Cumnor Place. This was a stupid lout, seemingly a farmer's boy, in a grey jerkin, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head <b>bare,</b> <b>his</b> hose about his heels, and huge startups upon his feet. He held by the bridle what of all things they most wanted--a palfrey, namely, with a side-saddle, and all other garniture for a woman's mounting; and he hailed Wayland Smith with, [...] "Zur, be ye zure the party?" ...|$|R
25|$|Psychic surgery, a pseudoscience constituting medical fraud, {{is when a}} {{practitioner}} creates the illusion of performing surgery <b>with</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>bare</b> hands and uses trickery, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that the diseased lesions were removed and that the incision spontaneously healed.|$|R
50|$|Hideyoshi is {{the ruler}} of the Toyotomi clan. He is {{depicted}} as a giant man, whose ambition is to rule all of Japan and form it into a formidable, prospering nation, which causes him to declare Oda {{as a source of}} chaos that must be annihilated. Even though he has good intentions, he is drunk with power and will use any means, no matter how ruthless, to achieve it (though he is still charismatic and caring to his subordinates, unlike Nobunaga). <b>With</b> just <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands, he can destroy a platoon in seconds. His weapons are his hands, which can be strengthened with magical arm guards.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen {{people were}} killed and about 235 were wounded. The dead {{included}} seventeen men, one woman, and a seven-year-old girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators while others were simply passers-by. Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, told reporters how a policeman murdered a nationalist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Dr. Jose N. Gándara, one of the physicians who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found {{in the hands of the}} civilians and cadets who were wounded nor on the dead. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail.|$|E
25|$|During the Fear Itself storyline, Steve Rogers {{is present}} when {{the threat of}} the Serpent is known. Following the {{apparent}} death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America uniform. When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents him with his reforged shield, now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow {{are the only ones who}} know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier.|$|E
50|$|Riddick's {{abilities}} at {{hand-to-hand combat}} {{is a mix}} of Krav Maga, Hapkido, Eskrima, and Ninjutsu; he uses his formidable fighting skills while confronting one of the night-creatures of Pitch Black <b>with</b> only <b>his</b> <b>bare</b> hands and a shiv he had made, killing it with relative ease, as well as defeating one of the Lord Marshall's best Necromonger warriors {{in a matter of seconds}} in Chronicles. Also, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshall and even injure him which the Lord Marshall admitted hadn't happened in a long time. While Riddick was no match for him in speed, he was able to hold off the Lord Marshall for several minutes.|$|R
6000|$|CARMODY (noticing him--with {{malicious}} satisfaction). Oho, {{here you}} are again. (Nicholls scowls and turns away. Carmody addresses <b>his</b> daughter <b>with</b> a sly wink at Murray.)

5000|$|His {{third album}} was Naughty. It {{featured}} a collaboration with Nina Hagen on [...] "Get Your Body!" [...] {{and plenty of}} club tunes, expanding from the artist's acid house roots into the pop and rock genres.
