5|$|Bangui has a rich music {{tradition}} and showcases the country's music. Its musicians also perform {{in many countries}} abroad. The Bangui band groups were influenced by Zokela in the 1980s. The innovative music is based on dance bands who have adopted the Congolese music with electronic support. The music is rhythmic and blends with the Congolese rumba (soukous), which was influenced by son cubano, cha-cha-cha, and merengue. Popular Central African music groups or dance bands <b>who</b> <b>perform</b> in the city are Musiki, Zokela, Makembe, Cool Stars, Cannon Stars, and Super Stars. Bokassa, during his tenure as President, established a music recording studio in Bangui and employed musicians to sing his praise with songs extolling his qualities as an emperor and to develop his cult image among his people.|$|E

5|$|The first anime {{incarnation}} of Cutie Honey was broadcast from October 13, 1973 to March 30, 1974, alongside the Go Nagai Cutie Honey manga that had started publishing on October 1, 1973. Fred Patten {{wrote in the}} liner notes for Rhino Entertainment's CD The Best of Anime (1998) that the series, even untranslated, was a favorite among early anime fan clubs for its nude transformation sequences and innuendos. Even as brief nudity became commonplace in 1980s anime, the continued popularity of Honey inspired New Cutie Honey creation in 1994. Toei Video announced the series {{in a press conference}} dated October 12, 1993, with Go Nagai, series director Yasuchika Nagaoka, Hitomi (the lead singer of the group les 5-4-3-2-1, <b>who</b> <b>perform</b> the series' Japanese theme song), and Honey and Chokkei's Japanese voice actors Neya and Matsumoto in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his Hijra (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE. He {{shared in the}} heavy work of construction. The original mosque was an open-air building. The mosque served as a community center, a court, and a religious school. There was a raised platform {{for the people who}} taught the Quran. Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated it. In 1909, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. The mosque is {{under the control of the}} Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located in what was traditionally the center of Medina, with many hotels and old markets nearby. It is a major pilgrimage site. Many pilgrims <b>who</b> <b>perform</b> the Hajj go on to Medina to visit the mosque due to its connections to the life of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants <b>who</b> <b>perform</b> worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
