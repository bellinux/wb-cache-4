50|$|He wanders about homeless. He begs {{and eats}} what he receives. He carries a <b>water</b> <b>strainer.</b> He strains the water before he drinks, {{in order to}} save the lives of little creatures that live in water, states the Upanishad.|$|E
5000|$|A pot, a {{drinking}} cup, a sling, a tripod, {{a pair of}} shoes, a patched garment against the cold, a loincloth, a <b>water</b> <b>strainer,</b> a bathing cloth, and an outer garment: an ascetic should avoid anything else other than these. Kundika Upanishad, Chapter 3 ...|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{types of}} {{volcanic}} ash do not dissolve easily in water. Instead, they clump {{on the surface}} of the ocean in pumice rafts. These rafts can clog salt <b>water</b> intake <b>strainers</b> very quickly, which can result in overheating of shipboard machinery dependent on sea water service cooling.|$|R
2500|$|Angel Torres-Collazo of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, {{developed}} a big <b>water</b> floating <b>strainer</b> that is constructed with a rectangular frame. According to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: [...] "A cylindrical drum {{is attached to}} each corner of the rectangular frame. Below the rectangular frame, a box-strainer is fixed. The distance between the box-strainer and the rectangular frame is adjustable so that {{the level at which}} water is drawn can be raised or lowered." ...|$|R
50|$|Another major {{whitewater}} {{feature is}} a sieve, {{which is a}} narrow empty space that water flows through between two obstructions, usually rocks. Similar to <b>strainers,</b> <b>water</b> is forced through the sieve, resulting in higher flow velocity which forces water up and creates turbulence.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particularly}} difficult problem in tropical waters is jellyfish. Their tentacles can be sucked into water intakes. In extremis {{it is possible}} for the rubber exhaust hose to catch fire, the plastic silencer to melt and the head-gasket to fail. In colder waters, boats are far less likely to meet such problems. The solution is to have a large basket-type <b>water</b> <b>strainer</b> and overheat alarms (standard on most Yanmar engines) ...|$|E
5000|$|Renunciation {{rites of}} passageHe should recite the mantras {{regarding}} the self,And say, [...] "May all living beings prosper!"Wear brownish red garment,Stop shaving armpits and pubic region,Shave {{his head and}} face, wear no string,And use his stomach as a begging bowl,wander about homeless,carry a <b>water</b> <b>strainer</b> to protect living things,Sleep on river bank or in a temple. —Kathashruti Upanishad Chapter 3 [...] The text presents the theme of renunciation {{as well as a}} description of the life of someone who has chosen the monastic path of life as a sannyasi in Hindu Ashrama culture. The Upanishad opens by stating that the renouncer, after following the prescribed order, and performing prescribed rites becomes a renunciant, should obtain the cheerful approval of his mother, father, wife, other family members and relatives, then distribute his property in any way he wishes, cut off his topknot hair and discard all possessions, before leaving them forever. As he is leaving, the sannyasi thinks of himself, [...] "you are the Brahman (ultimate reality), you are the sacrifice, you are the universe".|$|E
50|$|It is {{said the}} {{placenta}} of Buddha ratnavyuha {{was taken by}} Brahma to be enshrined in a stupa. When Buddha left the palace to seek enlightenment he severed his hair with a sword. According to theravada sources, throwing his top knot into the air, and says {{if he is to}} be Buddha it will remain in the sky. It stays at a height of one league, until it is taken by Indra to Trayastrimsa heaven. Mulasarvastivada Vinaya recounts how a friend of Kasyapa Buddha named Ghatikara gives him a monastric robe, bowl, razor, girdle, needle and <b>water</b> <b>strainer.</b> In another version the bodhisattva encounters this divinity disguised as a hunter and trades him his benares silk robes; which are enshrined in a catiya. Alternatively new robes came to Buddha from ten brothers from Kapulavastu who received hemp robes from their mother, about to parinirvanize they told her to give the robes to the Buddha; foreseeing his birth. The mother gave the robes to her daughter near death; who gave them to a tree spirit to give to the son of Suddhodana. Indra disguises as a hunter, then takes the robes from the tree and gives them to Buddha in exchange for the silk robes; which he enshrines in heaven and dedicates a festival to the robes. The bowl in which Buddha received milk rice after his long fast is said to have floated down the Nairanjana River before sinking down to the naga king Kala putting it with the bowls of the three previous Buddhas.|$|E
50|$|When {{the outside}} air's dry- and wet-bulb {{temperatures}} are low enough, a water-side economizer can use water cooled by a {{wet cooling tower}} or a dry cooler (also called a fluid cooler) to cool buildings without operating a chiller. They are historically known as the strainer cycle, but the water-side economizer is not a true thermodynamic cycle. Also, instead of passing the cooling tower <b>water</b> through a <b>strainer</b> {{and then to the}} cooling coils, which causes fouling, more often a plate-and-frame heat exchanger is inserted between the cooling tower and chilled water loops.|$|R
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling <b>water,</b> a tea <b>strainer,</b> a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|R

5000|$|Turbine meters {{are less}} {{accurate}} than displacement and jet meters at low flow rates, but the measuring element does not occupy or severely restrict the entire path of flow. The flow direction is generally {{straight through the}} meter, allowing for higher flow rates and less pressure loss than displacement-type meters. They are the meter of choice for large commercial users, fire protection and as master meters for the <b>water</b> distribution system. <b>Strainers</b> are generally required to be installed {{in front of the}} meter to protect the measuring element from gravel or other debris that could enter the water distribution system. Turbine meters are generally available for 1-½" [...] to 12" [...] or higher pipe sizes. Turbine meter bodies are commonly made of bronze, cast iron or ductile iron. Internal turbine elements can be plastic or non-corrosive metal alloys. They are accurate in normal working conditions but are greatly affected by the flow profile and fluid conditions.|$|R

40|$|An amphibious {{inspection}} {{robot system}} (hereafter AIROS) {{is being developed}} to visually inspect the in-containment refueling storage water tank (hereafter IRWST) strainer in APR 1400 instead of a human diver. Four IRWST strainers {{are located in the}} IRWST, which is filled with boric acid <b>water.</b> Each <b>strainer</b> has 108 sub-assembly strainer fin modules that should be inspected with the VT- 3 method according to Reg. guide 1. 82 and the operation manual. AIROS has 6 thrusters for submarine voyage and 4 legs for walking {{on the top of the}} strainer. An inverse kinematic algorithm was implemented in the robot controller for exact walking on the top of the IRWST strainer. The IRWST strainer has several top cross braces that are extruded on the top of the strainer, which can be obstacles of walking on the strainer, to maintain the frame of the strainer. Therefore, a robot leg should arrive at the position beside the top cross brace. For this reason, we used an image processing technique to find the top cross brace in the sole camera image. The sole camera image is processed to find the existence of the top cross brace using the cross edge detection algorithm in real time. A 5 -DOF robot arm that has multiple camera modules for simultaneous inspection of both sides can penetrate narrow gaps. For intuitive presentation of inspection results and for management of inspection data, inspection images are stored in the control PC with camera angles and positions to synthesize and merge the images. The synthesized images are then mapped in a 3 D CAD model of the IRWST strainer with the location information. An IRWST strainer mock-up was fabricated to teach the robot arm scanning and gaiting. It is important to arrive at the designated position for inserting the robot arm into all of the gaps. Exact position control without anchor under the water is not easy. Therefore, we designed the multi leg robot for the role of anchoring and positioning. Quadruped robot design of installing sole cameras was a new approach for the exact and stable position control on the IRWST strainer, unlike a traditional robot for underwater facility inspection. The developed robot will be practically used to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the inspection of nuclear power plant components...|$|R
60|$|When sago {{is to be}} made, a full-grown tree is {{selected}} just before {{it is going to}} flower. It is cut down close to the ground, the leaves and leafstalks cleared away, and a broad strip of the bark taken off the upper side of the trunk. This exposes the pithy matter, which is of a rusty colour {{near the bottom of the}} tree, but higher up pure white, about as hard as a dry apple, but with woody fibre running through it about a quarter of an inch apart. This pith is cut or broken down into a coarse powder by means of a tool constructed for the purpose--a club of hard and heavy wood, having a piece of sharp quartz rock firmly imbedded into its blunt end, and projecting about half an inch. By successive blows of this, narrow strips of the pith are cut away, and fall down into the cylinder formed by the bark. Proceeding steadily on, the whole trunk is cleared out, leaving a skin not more than half an inch in thickness. This material is carried away (in baskets made of the sheathing bases of the leaves) to the nearest water, where a washing-machine is put up, which is composed almost entirely of the saga tree itself. The large sheathing bases of the leaves form the troughs, and the fibrous covering from the leaf-stalks of the young cocoa-nut the <b>strainer.</b> <b>Water</b> is poured on the mass of pith, which is kneaded and pressed against the strainer till the starch is all dissolved and has passed through, when the fibrous refuse is thrown away, and a fresh basketful put in its place. The water charged with sago starch passes on to a trough, with a depression in the centre, where the sediment is deposited, the surplus water trickling off by a shallow outlet. When the trough is nearly full, the mass of starch, which has a slight reddish tinge, is made into cylinders of about thirty pounds' weight, and neatly covered with sago leaves, and in this state is sold as raw sago.|$|R
