25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people <b>who</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those <b>who</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E

25|$|In the Western world, Guan Yu is {{sometimes}} called the Taoist God of War, probably because {{he is one of}} the most well-known military generals worshipped by the Chinese people.

For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E

25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, those <b>who</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans.

It is difficult to posit whether this intolerance is caused by attending a segregated church, or if those who hold prejudiced views are more likely to seek out a segregated church.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{that the}} film would be controversial, Panahi and his crew {{submitted}} a fake script about some young men <b>who</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a football match to Iranian authorities {{in order to get}} permission to make the film. However, before they began shooting the Ministry of Guidance, which issues licenses for films to be shown publicly, told Panahi in advance that because of his past films they would not issue Offside a license until he re-edited his previous films. Not wanting to miss the World Cup tournament, Panahi ignored the Ministry and began shooting the film. As usual, Panahi cast non-professional actors for the film, and the group of young girls in the lead roles were mostly university students that Panahi found through friends who all were passionate fans of football. The film was shot in 39 days and in order to move unnoticed through large crowds Panahi used digital video for the first time so as to have a smaller, more inconspicuous camera. Panahi also officially listed his Assistant Director as the Director of the film so as not {{to attract the attention of}} the Ministry of Guidance or the Disciplinary Forces of Tehran, but towards the end of the films shooting a newspaper article about the making of the film listed Panahi as the director and both organizations attempted to shut the film down and confiscate the footage. Only a sequence that takes place on a bus remained to be filmed so Panahi was able to continue filming without being caught.|$|E
