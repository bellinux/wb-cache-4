25|$|Most {{conifers}} are monoecious, {{but some}} are subdioecious or dioecious; all are <b>wind-pollinated.</b> Conifer seeds develop inside a protective cone called a strobilus. The cones take from four months to three years to reach maturity, and vary in size from 2mm to 600mm long.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{produced}} in dense spike-like, basally interrupted inflorescences. Very small flowers sit in one- to three- (rarely eight-) flowered glomerules in the axils of short bracts {{or in the}} upper half of the inflorescence without bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are urn-shaped, green or tinged reddish, and consist of five basally connate perianth segments (tepals), 3-5 × 2–3mm, 5 stamens, and a semi-inferior ovary with 2-3 stigmas. The perianths of neighbouring flowers are often fused. Flowers are <b>wind-pollinated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flowers may {{be small}} and inconspicuous, {{as well as}} green and not showy. They produce {{enormous}} numbers of relatively small pollen grains (hence <b>wind-pollinated</b> plants may be allergens, but seldom are animal-pollinated plants allergenic). Their stigmas may be large and feathery to catch the pollen grains. Insects may visit them to collect pollen; in some cases, these are ineffective pollinators and exert little natural selection on the flowers, {{but there are also}} examples of ambophilous flowers which are both wind and insect pollinated.|$|E
5000|$|Plants of the Hamamelidaceae have sticky pollen, {{which may}} have {{influenced}} the type of pollination that is seen in this family. Pollination is predominately via insects or wind. However, the insect-pollinated genus Disanthus {{has been known to}} <b>wind-pollinate</b> (although inefficiently) in the event pollinators do not visit its flowers. The genus Rhodoleia is unique because it is bird-pollinated ...|$|R
500|$|Various {{trends are}} {{apparent}} among the lilioids, notably a change to an inferior ovary {{and a reduction}} {{of the number of}} stamens to three. In some groups (such as the genus Trillium in the Liliaceae), the tepals have become clearly differentiated, so that the flower has three coloured petals and three smaller green sepals. Almost all lilioid monocots retain at least three petal-like tepals. Since some commelinids (e.g. Tradescantia) have petaloid flowers, the term 'lilioid' is a more accurate one for the group which excludes them, since the term petaloid monocot is still occasionally used in describing commelinids. The morphological concept of petaloid monocots has been equated with [...] "animal-attracting" [...] (that is, for pollination) as opposed to <b>wind-pollinating</b> plants (such as grasses) that have evolved very different floral structures. Pollen structure shows that of the two main tapetum types, secretory and plasmodial, the lilioid monocots are nearly all secretory.|$|R
50|$|The European beech (Fagus sylvatica) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} cultivated, although there are few important differences between species aside from detail elements such as leaf shape. The leaves of beech trees are entire or sparsely toothed, from 5-15 cm long and 4-10 cm broad. Beeches are monoecious, bearing {{both male and female}} flowers on the same plant. The small flowers are unisexual, the female flowers borne in pairs, the male flowers <b>wind-pollinating</b> catkins. They are produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The bark is smooth and light grey. The fruit is a small, sharply three-angled nut 10-15 mm long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5-2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The husk can have a variety of spine- to scale-like appendages, the character of which is, in addition to leaf shape, one of the primary ways beeches are differentiated. The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.|$|R
25|$|Growing to {{a height}} of up to , the Cornish Elm is a slender, slow-growing {{deciduous}} tree, distinguished by its long, straight trunk, which culminates in a narrow fan-shaped crown comprising short, straight, ascending branches. The leaves are small, obovate to oval, typically acuminate at the apex, 6cm long by 3.5cm broad, with a dark-green upper surface, glossy and smooth. The perfect apetalous <b>wind-pollinated</b> flowers occur in clusters of 1520 on very short pedicels. The samarae rarely ripened in England, but when mature were {{very similar to those}} of others in the Field Elm group, being mostly obovate, 16mm long by 10mm broad.|$|E
25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of anemophilous (<b>wind-pollinated)</b> plants, which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are <b>wind-pollinated</b> pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that among angiosperms, {{entomophily}} is the primitive state; this is indicated by the vestigial nectaries in the <b>wind-pollinated</b> Urtica and other plants, {{and the presence of}} fragrances in some of these plants. Of the angiosperms, grasses, sedges, rushes and catkin-bearing plants are in general wind pollinated. Other flowering plants are mostly biotic, the pollen being carried by animal vectors. However a number of plants in multiple families have secondarily adopted wind pollination in contrast to other members of their groups. Some plants are intermediate between the two pollination methods. common heather is regularly pollinated by insects, but produce clouds of pollen and some wind pollination is inevitable, and the hoary plantain is primarily wind pollinated, but is also visited by insects which pollinate it.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or <b>wind-pollinated.</b> The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelet.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 pollen {{found on}} the Shroud of Turin was {{analysed}} and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely {{be the result of}} the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a <b>wind-pollinated</b> plant. Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the pollen analysis and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for doubt is that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature.|$|E
500|$|Cactus {{flowers are}} pollinated by insects, birds and bats. None {{are known to}} be <b>wind-pollinated</b> and {{self-pollination}} occurs in only a very few species; for example the flowers of some species of Frailea do not open (cleistogamy). The need to attract pollinators has led to the evolution of pollination syndromes, which are defined as groups of [...] "floral traits, including rewards, associated with the attraction and utilization of a specific group of animals as pollinators." ...|$|E
500|$|Tree {{forms are}} found {{in a wide range}} of plants and their {{reproductive}} strategies are substantially the same as shrub or herbaceous plant forms. Many trees are wind pollinated which may be an evolutionary adaptation to take advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground, particularly in the case of those that produce pollen before the leaves emerge. A vast quantity of pollen is produced because of the low likelihood of any particular grain landing on an appropriate female flower. <b>Wind-pollinated</b> flowers of broad-leaved trees are characterised by a lack of showy parts, no scent and a copious production of pollen, often with separate male and female flowers, or separate male and female trees. The male flowers may be high up in the tree, often in the form of dangling catkins. The female flowers may be lower down the tree. The pollen of pine trees contains air sacs which give it buoyancy and it has been known to travel as far as [...] Tree pollen can cause allergies and hay fever.|$|E
500|$|Extinct Mecoptera {{species may}} have been {{important}} pollinators of early gymnosperm seed plants during the late Middle Jurassic to mid–Early Cretaceous periods before other pollinating {{groups such as the}} bees evolved. These were mainly <b>wind-pollinated</b> plants, but fossil mecopterans had siphon-feeding apparatus that could have fertilized these early gymnosperms by feeding on their nectar and pollen. The lack of iron enrichment in their fossilized probosces rules out their use for drinking blood. Eleven species have been identified from three families, Mesopsychidae, Aneuretopsychidae, and Pseudopolycentropodidae within the clade Aneuretopsychina. Their lengths range from [...] in Parapolycentropus burmiticus to [...] in Lichnomesopsyche gloriae. The proboscis could be as long as [...] It has been suggested that these mecopterans transferred pollen on their mouthparts and head surfaces, as in bee flies and hoverflies today, but no such associated pollen has been found, even when the insects were finely preserved in Eocene Baltic amber. They likely pollinated plants such as Caytoniaceae, Cheirolepidiaceae, and Gnetales, which have ovulate organs that are either poorly suited for wind pollination or have structures that could support long-proboscid fluid feeding. [...] The Aneuretopsychina were the most diverse group of mecopterans in the Latest Permian, taking the place of the Permochoristidae, to the Middle Triassic. [...] During the Late Triassic though the Middle Jurassic, Aneuretopsychina species were gradually replaced by species from the Parachoristidae and Orthophlebiidae. [...] Modern mecopteran families are derived from the Orthophlebiidae.|$|E

2500|$|Olive tree pollen is {{extremely}} allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. Olea europaea is primarily <b>wind-pollinated,</b> and their light, buoyant pollen {{is a strong}} trigger for asthma. One popular variety, [...] "Swan Hill", is widely sold as an [...] "allergy-free" [...] olive tree; however, this variety does bloom and produce allergenic pollen.|$|E
2500|$|The genus is hermaphroditic, having apetalous perfect flowers {{which are}} <b>wind-pollinated.</b> Elm leaves are alternate, with simple, single- or, most commonly, doubly serrate margins, usually {{asymmetric}} {{at the base}} and acuminate at the [...] The fruit is a round wind-dispersed samara flushed with chlorophyll, facilitating photosynthesis before the leaves emerge. All species are tolerant {{of a wide range}} of soils and pH levels but, with few exceptions, demand good drainage. [...] The elm tree can grow to great height, often with a split trunk creating a vase-shape profile.|$|E
2500|$|Transgenic {{creeping}} bentgrass, {{engineered to}} be glyphosate-tolerant as [...] "one {{of the first}} <b>wind-pollinated,</b> perennial, and highly outcrossing transgenic crops", was planted in 2003 {{as part of a}} large (about 160 ha) field trial in central Oregon near Madras, Oregon. In 2004, its pollen was found to have reached wild growing bentgrass populations up to 14 kilometres away. Cross-pollinating Agrostis gigantea was even found at a distance of 21 kilometres. The grower, Scotts Company could not remove all genetically engineered plants, and in 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Scotts $500,000 for noncompliance with regulations.|$|E
