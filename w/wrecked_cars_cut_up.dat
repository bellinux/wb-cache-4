50|$|The main focus, however, is on Thomas's {{financial}} and emotional struggles. Although {{he says he}} was never an alcoholic, Thomas says that in the late 1970s and early 1980s his drinking became worse, and that he often drank while home alone. These confessions were the first time there had been any public suggestion that Thomas was a heavy drinker. Burdened by student loans and subsisting on low government salaries, Thomas had a difficult time financially, almost getting evicted from his apartment several times. In one incident, a <b>car</b> rental agent <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> Thomas's credit card in front of him. After falling out of love with his first wife, Thomas worried about the morality of leaving her and his child.|$|R
