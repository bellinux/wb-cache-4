25|$|A solvent {{can carry}} a {{supersaturated}} load of gas in solution. Whether it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution in {{the bulk of the}} solvent to form bubbles will depend on a number of factors. Something which reduces surface tension, or adsorbs gas molecules, or locally reduces solubility of the gas, or causes a local reduction in static pressure in a fluid may result in a bubble nucleation or growth. This may include velocity changes and turbulence in fluids and local tensile loads in solids and semi-solids. Lipids and other hydrophobic surfaces may reduce surface tension (blood vessel walls may have this effect). Dehydration may reduce gas solubility in a tissue due to higher concentration of other solutes, and less solvent to hold the gas.|$|E

Another theory presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules which resists the effect of surface tension.|$|E

500|$|In June 2007, {{prior to}} production, a German Defence Ministry {{spokesperson}} said that filming of Valkyrie {{would not be}} allowed at the country's military sites if protagonist Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg was portrayed by Tom Cruise, due to the actor's adherence to Scientology, which is regarded as a dangerous cult by the German authorities. The spokesperson further indicated that the ministry had not at that time received official filming requests from Valkyries producers. Colonel Stauffenberg's eldest child, retired Bundeswehr general Berthold Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, also voiced concerns over Cruise's portrayal of his father, saying that he would not oppose the film's production, but hoped that Cruise would drop the role. [...] "I fear that only terrible kitsch <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the project. It's bound to be rubbish," [...] he said. [...] "Cruise should keep his hands off my father." [...] Later in the month, the ministry reversed its stance and welcomed production of Valkyrie.|$|E

500|$|According to Rimsky-Korsakov, {{the other}} members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the {{orchestra}} in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that [...] "they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "might amount to something" [...] as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Apparently [...] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks".|$|E
500|$|Opinions on {{the film}} were mixed in Gulu, one of former centers of rebel {{activities}} in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello, said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were [...] "unfounded", going on to state, [...] "Invisible Children has done visible things in Acholi, for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy." [...] Betty Bigombe, a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, [...] "I {{do not know whether}} it makes any difference as far as taking [...] out is concerned. However, what is important is bringing this to the attention of policymakers. I hope that something innovative <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Norbert Mao, Ugandan politician and president of the opposition Democratic Party, stated his support for the film, explaining that while it does have some problems, such as implying Ugandans did not try to fight back against the LRA and not explaining how many of the issues in the film were also exacerbated by the Ugandan government itself, the film is still a [...] "positive development" [...] for the issue, adding that while Invisible Children may not be [...] "the foremost analysts of the complicated political, historical and security dynamics" [...] in the situation, [...] "they have the most beautiful trait on earth -- compassion." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{oil well}} {{produces}} predominantly crude oil, with some natural gas dissolved in it. Because {{the pressure is}} lower at the surface than underground, some of the gas <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> solution and be recovered (or burned) as associated gas or solution gas. A gas well produces predominantly natural gas. However, because the underground temperature and pressure are higher than at the surface, the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, and heptane in the gaseous state. At surface conditions these will condense out of the gas to form [...] "natural gas condensate", often shortened to condensate. Condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some volatile light crude oils.|$|E

2500|$|Until 2004, {{copyright}} in Australia {{was based}} on the [...] "plus 50" [...] law which restricts works until 50 years after the author's death. In 2004 this was changed to a [...] "plus 70" [...] law in line with the USA and European Union, but this change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which bought some e.g. British authors back into copyright). The consequence is that the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia. However the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, so that no more Australian authors <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> copyright until 1 January 2026 (i.e. those who died in 1955).|$|E
2500|$|Lucky Ajax are a {{beneficiary}} {{team that}} was initiated by Sjaak Swart in the seventies, competing {{in at least one}} match a year, usually in the name of charity and/or to bid farewell to retiring former Ajax players.

Past participants have included Barry Hulshoff, Sonny Silooy, Simon Tahamata, Ronald Koeman, Tscheu La Ling, Gerrie Mühren, John van 't Schip, Brian Roy, Stanley Menzo, Peter van Vossen and Fred Grim. The name Lucky Ajax is derived from the famous [...] "Lucky Ajax" [...] nickname from how people used to refer to the club when Ajax would either win a match by chance, by a decision of a referee, or by coincidence such as was said to be the case during the infamous Mistwedstrijd ("Fog Match").|$|E
2500|$|Three {{months later}} Poirot goes {{to visit the}} convent Casey's {{daughter}} entered, in a remote part of the western coast of Ireland. He discovers that she had died two months earlier. Poirot makes the acquaintance {{of one of the}} locals who helps him break into the convent – where he recovers the goblet. He returns it to Power and tells him that the nuns were using it as a chalice. Casey's daughter probably took it there to atone for her father's sins and the nuns were ignorant of its ownership and ancient history. Poirot deduced it would be at the convent as there had been no trace of anyone having the goblet after it was stolen. Therefore, it was somewhere where [...] "ordinary material values did not apply". The mention of Casey's daughter being a nun supplied the obvious place. Poirot shows Power how, during the Renaissance, the Pope used a hidden mechanism in the goblet to put the poison in the victim's drink. Poirot suggests no good <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> owning an object with such an evil history. If it is given back to the convent, the nuns will say masses for Power's soul. He reminds Power of his boyhood in western Ireland. Power agrees; he has got what he wants, which was to own the goblet. Poirot returns the goblet to the convent as the gift of a man so unhappy he does not know he is unhappy.|$|E
