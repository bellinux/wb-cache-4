5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia <b>worn</b> <b>and</b> as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: All most of floors {{can become}} less slip {{resistant}} with wear. The deterioration of slip resistance can often occur rapidly. So relatively new products can become hazardous {{within a short}} period of time. The main objective of this study was the comparison of slip resistance variations caused by traffic <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> accelerative <b>wear.</b> The second objective was to ascertain the effect of <b>wear,</b> <b>and</b> to find out the causes of slip resistance change. Although statistical differences were observed between results of traffic <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> accelerative <b>wear,</b> the trend of the variations of slip resistance caused by traffic <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> accelerative <b>wear</b> was very similar. The measured slip resistance of tested floor changed up to 29 %(and 26. 5 %) after 100, 000 steps(and 750 cycles). As the traffic <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> accelerative <b>wear</b> were progressed, the surface roughness of the tested floor became smoother, and so the floor became more slippery under the wet condition. The abraded(worn out) floor surface tended to become hydrophilic surface, while the new floor surface tended to show hydrophobic nature. This phenomenon woul...|$|R

UA 8699 lacks a cingulid (ridge) resembling a shelf on the lingual (inner) side, indicating that is not a member of Australosphenida (the proposed clade uniting monotremes and some ancient Gondwanan mammals, including the Jurassic Madagascan Ambondro); thus, it can be identified as representing Boreosphenida, which includes marsupials, placentals, and their extinct relatives.|$|E
5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing <b>worn,</b> <b>and</b> lung damage.

5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an elongate, two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the elongate metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is <b>worn</b> <b>and</b> poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, may end in a small hypoconulid. A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a more acute angle), the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial cingulum is strong.|$|E
40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the basic}} means of production, just as of all the instruments of labor, is that, {{taking part in the}} process of production during a lengthy period of time, they preserve their natural form up to the end of their productive life.

The <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> tear of basic means is not always proportional to their age, for it depends on the volume of work performed {{and a number of other}} facts. At the same time <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> tear {{of the basic}} means determines their efficiency, the time of their final quitting the ranks and the time for replacement.
