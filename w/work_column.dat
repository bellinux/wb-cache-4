40|$|Abstract Investigation of a Commercial Product (BiOWiSH­­TM) for Nitrogen Management Eva Lee BiOWiSH–Aqua, {{which has}} the {{capability}} of treating nitrogen from wastewater through bioaugmentation, is a commercial product consisting of a blend of microorganisms developed by BiOWiSH Technologies. A study of the treatment of nitrogen compounds (i. e.,, and) using Biowish–Aqua was conducted using small scale experiments (flask experiments) and large scale experiments (column reactor experiments). In this <b>work,</b> <b>column</b> reactors were created to test Biowish–Aqua’s nitrogen treating capabilities by providing enough depth to simulate the dissolved oxygen gradient that {{can be observed in}} a pond. The results show that the optimal growth conditions for both ammonia assimilating and denitrifying bacteria are an anoxic environment with a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 2 : 1. Under this optimal growth environment, Biowish–Aqua was able to assimilate ammonia with a zero order k value of 3. 06 ppm/day. Also, under the same conditions, Biowish–Aqua was able to eliminate nitrate () and nitrite () at a rate of 9. 58 ppm/day and 5. 64 ppm/day respectively. The experiments also suggested that with a C:N ratio of 2 : 1, Biowish–Aqua did not have an effect in slowing the hydrolysis of urea. Overall, this research suggests that the application of Biowish–Aqua is a feasible nitrogen removing strategy for wastewater with initial presence of ammonia and nitrate between 10 to 20 ppm.

40|$|In {{the present}} <b>work</b> <b>column</b> {{transport}} tests were performed {{in order to}} study the mobility of guar-gum suspensions of microscale zero-valent iron particles (MZVI) in porous media. The results were analyzed {{with the purpose of}} implementing a radial model for the design of full scale interventions. The transport tests were performed using several concentrations of shear thinning guar gum solutions as stabilizer (1. 5, 3 and 4 g/l) and applying different flow rates (Darcy velocity in the range 1 · 10 − 4 to 2 · 10 − 3 m/s), representative of different distances from the injection point in the radial domain. Empirical relationships, expressing the dependence of the deposition and release parameters on the flow velocity, were derived by inverse fitting of the column transport tests using a modified version of E-MNM 1 D (Tosco and Sethi, 2010) and the user interface MNMs (www. polito. it/groundwater/software). They were used to develop a comprehensive transport model of MZVI suspensions in radial coordinates, called E-MNM 1 R, which takes into account the non Newtonian (shear thinning) rheological properties of the dispersant fluid and the porous medium clogging associated with filtration and sedimentation in the porous medium of both MZVI and guar gum residual undissolved particles. The radial model was run in forward mode to simulate the injection of MZVI dispersed in guar gum in conditions similar to those applied in the column transport tests. In a second stage, we demonstrated how the model {{can be used as a}} valid tool for the design and the optimization of a full scale intervention. The simulation results indicated that several concurrent aspects are to be taken into account for the design of a successful delivery of MZVI/guar gum slurries via permeation injection, and a compromise is necessary between maximizing the radius of influence of the injection and minimizing the injection pressure, to guarantee a sufficiently homogeneous distribution of the particles around the injection point and to prevent preferential flow path...|$|E

40|$|Microscale and {{nanoscale}} zerovalent iron particles (MZVI and NZVI, respectively), {{used for}} groundwater remediation, are not stable when dispersed in water, due to fast aggregation and sedimentation of the particles. Consequently, {{the use of}} shear thinning solutions of green biopolymers (e. g. starch, guar gum, xanthan gum) have been recently studied as viscous carrier fluids for the delivery of MZVI and NZVI. Shear thinning fluids exhibit high viscosity at low flow rates (which improves colloidal stability in static conditions) and lower viscosity at high flow rates, corresponding to the injection in the subsurface, when low viscosity (and consequently low pressures) is required. In this work, co-funded by European Union project AQUAREHAB (FP 7 - Grant Agreement Nr. 226565), a modelling approach is described to simulate the transport in porous media of nanoscale iron slurries in both laboratory conditions (1 -dimensional column tests) and field conditions (radial flow). When modelling the transport of highly concentrated slurries (in the order of several g/l) of NZVI and MZVI in porous media, clogging phenomena (i. e. reduction of porosity and permeability due to particles deposition) are {{to be taken into}} account, and the rheological properties of the carrier fluids are to be considered for a correct estimate of pressure drops. Colloid transport mechanisms are controlled by particle-particle and particle-collector interactions, typically modelled with kinetic terms of deposition onto the porous medium and corresponding release. Beside other parameters, deposition and release kinetics are affected by flow rate and fluid viscosity. In this <b>work,</b> <b>column</b> transport tests of microsized iron particles (BASF HQ, d 50 = 1. 1 μm) are presented, performed at different flow rates and different polymer concentrations (guar gum at 1. 5, 3 and 4 g/l). E-MNM 1 D is used for inverse simulations of the results, and the dependence of deposition and release kinetics on flow rate and fluid viscosity is modelled. The newly derived relationships are implemented in a radial transport model, E-MNM, which is used for the simulation of field-scale injection of MZVI slurries in porous media. The software is intended as a tool supporting the design of field-scale applications of MZVI and NZVI -based remediation, for the estimate of the radius of influence of the slurry injectio...|$|E
