5|$|I am only {{writing to}} the {{following}} – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, {{and would like to}} hear what other clubs you <b>would</b> <b>suggest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis <b>would</b> <b>suggest.</b> As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E
5|$|From 1499 to 1508 {{a number}} of other expeditions were {{launched}} from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was ‘almost in the latitude of Gibraltar’ and ‘almost the longitude of Cuba’. This <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{arrangement}} {{he had thought}} of, but <b>would</b> not <b>suggest.</b>|$|R
50|$|Diffuse sandy lenses {{associated}} with standing vegetation at numerous horizons, within the poorly drained floodplain assemblage containing heterolithic bedding. These typically occur above rooted horizons. Scour-and-mound beds that are between sand and heterolithic bedding <b>would</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that they are}} formed in forested areas with standing water. Where sand charged flows rapidly decelerated and deposited large amounts of sediment with only minimal scour.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{knew the}} game. He <b>would</b> have <b>suggested</b> it himself if his faction {{had been in}} the majority.|$|R
5|$|Further {{observations}} will {{be needed}} in order to determine S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit. If it is circular, it <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that S/2015 (136472) 1 was formed by an ancient impact event, but if it is elliptical, it suggests that it may have been captured.|$|E
5|$|Neither the {{producers}} nor the United States Geological Survey published any production amounts for osmium. Estimations of the United States consumption date published from 1971, which gives a {{consumption in the}} United States of 2000troy ounces (62kg), <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that the production is still less than 1ton per year. In 2012, the estimated US production of osmium was 75kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Gyeongju is more diverse than the city's {{image as a}} tourist haven <b>would</b> <b>suggest.</b> Although tourism is {{important}} to the economy, most residents work in other fields. Over 27,000 are employed in manufacturing compared to roughly 13,500 in the hospitality industry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose, now," [...] {{continued}} Nicholas, [...] "that you had {{the power}} to influence nations, what <b>would</b> you <b>suggest</b> instead of war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am in your hands,' he cried. 'What <b>would</b> you <b>suggest</b> that {{we should}} do? Would it not be best that I should remain here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{have been}} talking to you--Matteo and Filippo. It is they who have put this in your head. I knew it <b>would</b> be <b>suggested</b> again.' ...|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} varies with {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin. This can best be understood {{as the result of}} multiple floods; the variable levels correspond to Lake Missoula breaching the ice dam at varying lake levels, releasing different volumes of flood waters. This <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> the time between floods is variable.|$|E
5|$|While {{holding the}} signoria of Florence, Robert of Naples (12771343) had {{the eastern part}} of the Bargello in Florence constructed, where he had his vicar the Count of Battifolle reside. Villani writes in 1316 that Robert's vicar oversaw the {{construction}} of a large part of the new palace, which <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> Robert's vicar had a great amount of influence in the construction of the eastern addition of the Palazzo del Podestà, including its Magdalen Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media than {{conventional}} wisdom <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as majority leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E
60|$|He {{had brought}} Pétronelle along with him: his careless, lavish {{hospitality}} <b>would</b> have <b>suggested</b> the housing of Juliette's entire domestic establishment, had she possessed one.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detection}} of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter <b>would</b> strongly <b>suggest</b> that ΛCDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} in my place," [...] I replied, {{somewhat}} cuttingly, [...] "you <b>would</b> probably <b>suggest</b> {{a lot of little}} things which would make everything very easy for her." ...|$|R
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics <b>would</b> <b>suggest.</b> He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|Asda's latest {{attempt to}} draw {{attention}} to themselves involves trying to leap on the Harry Potter bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Curious," [...] mused Sir James. [...] "You did {{not mention}} his name this afternoon, or I <b>would</b> have <b>suggested</b> your going to him for further {{information}} with my card as introduction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame says violent {{exercise}} {{is not good}} for girls, so we gave up gymnastics long ago," [...] said Maud, in her languid voice, wishing that Sally <b>would</b> not <b>suggest</b> disagreeable things.|$|R
50|$|A 2006 {{study found}} that Delta Corvi {{displayed}} no excess infrared emission that <b>would</b> otherwise <b>suggest</b> the presence of circumstellar matter, however warm interstellar dust was detected in a 2014 study.|$|R
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be jabers! but it's cold, it is," [...] he cried. [...] "If I {{might be}} so bold, I <b>would</b> jist <b>suggest</b> {{that we should}} go down below. How is the dead man?" ...|$|R
50|$|There is some archeological {{evidence}} suggesting {{the use of}} lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs <b>would</b> certainly <b>suggest</b> a pre-Christian root for this art form.|$|R
5000|$|Attempts {{were made}} by the FA to take over the {{monitoring}} function for the OKW/Chi which was vigorously resisted and in view of the types of monitoring which the FA conducted, which was similar to the FA requirements, <b>would</b> <b>suggested</b> that the duplication of monitoring activities as unnecessary. Dr. Walther Fricke, a leading cryptographer of the OKW/Chi, who stated that he knew nothing of the FA until some of them came to Schloss Glucksburg, and who stated that they were a big name with nothing behind them, on being told that the FA employed over 2000 personnel, his comments were: ...|$|R
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|Federal Forest Highway16 (FFH16) is {{a forest}} highway {{in the western}} Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. This road runs through the Ottawa National Forest in Iron, Houghton and Ontonagon counties. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has erroneously marked it as H-16 on their {{official}} state map. FFH16 is designated by the US Forest Service (USFS) with maintenance shared by the county road commissions (ICRC, HCRC, OCRC, respectively). Although the MDOT maps <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that it is a}} part of the County-Designated Highway System (CDH system), it is not. The three counties in question do not participate in the system, and the roadway falls in the middle of the G zone for numbering purposes.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1988 {{publication}} of Roddy Doyle's novel The Commitments (1987) in the United Kingdom, producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights, and asked Doyle {{to write a}} film adaptation. Doyle, an inexperienced screenwriter, spent one year drafting the script, accompanied by Myles and Randall-Cutler. Although a script was completed, Myles felt it needed improvement, and passed the book on to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, hoping that they <b>would</b> <b>suggest</b> a more experienced writer. However, upon reading the novel, Clement and La Frenais agreed to help write the script themselves.|$|E

60|$|Susan {{held the}} object at arm's length and {{contemplated}} {{it with a}} satisfaction {{in which there was}} no smile. To anybody acquainted with the inhabitants of Egdon Heath the image <b>would</b> have <b>suggested</b> Eustacia Yeobright.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} absurd {{for the child}} to go to Leadville on that account. A mining camp is no place for such a frail thing," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Merrick. [...] "What <b>would</b> you <b>suggest,</b> Patsy?" ...|$|R
