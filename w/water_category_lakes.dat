40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} the national classifications of good ecological status to be harmonised through an intercalibration exercise. In this exercise, {{significant differences in}} status classification among Member States are harmonized by comparing and, if necessary, adjusting the good status boundaries of the national assessment methods. Intercalibration is performed for rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters, focusing on selected types of water bodies (intercalibration types), anthropogenic pressures and Biological Quality Elements. Intercalibration exercises were carried out in Geographical Intercalibration Groups - larger geographical units including Member States with similar water body types - and followed the procedure described in the WFD Common Implementation Strategy Guidance document on the intercalibration process (European Commission, 2011). In a first phase, the intercalibration exercise started in 2003 and extended until 2008. The results from this exercise were agreed on by Member States and then published in a Commission Decision, consequently becoming legally binding (EC, 2008). A second intercalibration phase extended from 2009 to 2012, and {{the results from this}} exercise were agreed on by Member States and laid down in a new Commission Decision (EC, 2013) repealing the previous decision. Member States should apply the results of the intercalibration exercise to their national classification systems in order to set the boundaries between high and good status and between good and moderate status for all their national types. Annex 1 to this Decision sets out the results of the intercalibration exercise for which intercalibration is successfully achieved, within the limits of what is technically feasible at this point in time. The Technical report on the Water Framework Directive intercalibration describes in detail how the intercalibration exercise has been carried out for the <b>water</b> <b>categories</b> and biological quality elements included in that Annex. The Technical report is organized in volumes according to the <b>water</b> <b>category</b> (rivers, <b>lakes,</b> coastal and transitional waters), Biological Quality Element and Geographical Intercalibration group. This volume addresses the intercalibration of the cross-GIG phytobenthos ecological assessment methods. One of the key actions identified by the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000 / 60 /EC) is to develop ecological assessment tools and carry out a European intercalibration (IC) exercise. The aim of the Intercalibration is to ensure that the values assigned by each Member State to the good ecological class boundaries are consistent with the Directive?s generic description of these boundaries and comparable to the boundaries proposed by other MS. In total, 83 lake assessment methods were submitted for the 2 nd phase of the WFD intercalibration (2008 - 2012) and 62 intercalibrated and included in the EC Decision on Intercalibration (EC 2013). The intercalibration was carried out in the 13 Lake Geographical Intercalibration Groups according to the ecoregion and biological quality element.

30|$|Determination of {{salinity}} hazard is {{very important}} in irrigation water, as high salt content renders the soil saline. This also affects the salt intake capacity of the plants through the roots. Electrical conductivity (EC) is a measure of water capacity to convey electric current. It signifies the amount of total dissolved salts (TDS). Thus, in the present study, the salinity hazard was evaluated by EC and TDS, their amounts varied from 415 to 1475 μmhoscm− 1 and 246 – 916  ppm with an average value of 1, 057.5 μmhoscm− 1 and 661.5  ppm, respectively. Based on the classification of TDS as suggested by USSL (1954), most of the water samples (85  %) are classified as moderate <b>water</b> <b>category.</b> According to the EC grading standards as suggested by Wilcox (1955), most of the water samples (85  %) are classified as permissible <b>water</b> <b>category.</b> Therefore, the continuation use of this moderate saline water for irrigation in the long term may increase the salinity hazard in the soils of the studied area.|$|R

40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and transitional waters (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or benthic invertebrates (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and phytobenthos (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other <b>water</b> <b>categories</b> abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and <b>water</b> <b>categories.</b> The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > benthic invertebrates > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of <b>water</b> <b>categories</b> the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > transitional waters > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classificationJRC.

40|$|In 1990 - 93, tritium {{concentrations}} in water from 19 springs {{along the north}} side of the Snake River near Twin Falls and Hagerman ranged from 9. 2 {+-} 0. 6 to 78. 4 {+-} 5. 1 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The springs were placed into three categories on the basis of their locations and tritium concentrations: Category I springs are the farthest upstream and contained from 52. 8 {+-} 3. 2 to 78. 4 {+-} 5. 1 pCi/L of tritium; Category It springs are downstream from those in Category I and contained from 9. 2 {+-} 0. 6 to 18. 5 {+-} 1. 2 pCi/L; and Category III springs are the farthest downstream and contained from 28. 3 {+-} 1. 9 to 47. 7 {+-} 3. 2 pCi/L. Tritium {{concentrations in}} precipitation and in the Snake River were relatively large in the 1950 `s and 1960 `s owing to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Conversely, tritium concentrations in ground water with a residence time of several tens to a few hundred years, as occurs in the Snake River Plain aquifer hydraulically upgradient from the Category II springs, are comparatively small because of the 12. 4 -year half-life of tritium. The conclusion that recharge from excess applied-irrigation water from the Snake River has affected tritium in the Snake River Plain aquifer is supported by differences in the deuterium (2 H) and oxygen- 18 (180) ratios of water. These ratios indicate that water discharged by the springs is recharged by waters of different origins. Irrigation recharge is more enriched in 2 H and 180 than the regional ground <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> from <b>Category</b> I springs is more enriched in 2 H and 180 than is <b>water</b> from <b>Category</b> II or III springs because a large proportion of irrigation recharge mixes with the regional ground <b>water</b> in <b>Category</b> I springs.
