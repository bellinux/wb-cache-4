5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> {{the front cover}} design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced {{in the book and}} wanted this echoed on the cover.

5|$|Baby Connor was a {{main focus}} of season three, but the creators {{were well aware of}} the {{limitations}} of a baby character. With Connor’s initial role in plot decided, they came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a 'teenage' version for further appearances.|$|E
5|$|Powers were renewed in 1926 {{for four}} tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the Piccadilly running {{non-stop}} {{on the inner}} pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) proudly announces to the parks and recreation staff that she will be judging the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant, a job she takes very seriously. Tom (Aziz Ansari), excited at the prospective of judging women {{on the basis of their}} looks, pulls some strings to get a spot on the judging panel along with Leslie. April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{had been}} {{impressed}} in Leipzig <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from string quartet recitals, {{a rarity in}} London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including piano trios of Louis Spohr and Ludwig van Beethoven, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso Alexander Dreyschock and Frédéric Chopin's pupil, the 13-year old Carl Filtsch.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, {{is analogous to the}} selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|David 8, {{commonly}} known as David, is a fictional character featured in the Alien franchise, portrayed by Michael Fassbender. Introduced in the first prequel film, Prometheus (2012), David is an android serving as a butler, maintenance man and surrogate son to his creator, Peter Weyland, {{the founder of the}} Weyland Corporation. While he assists his human companions in their interstellar expedition to meet their creators, the extraterrestrial Engineers, David is obsessed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> creating life of his own. After Peter Weyland is killed, David is freed from servitude, allowing him to conduct his experiments to engineer Aliens.|$|E
5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet was not {{enthusiastic}} about secession from the Union, {{but he had}} long been infused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> states' rights, and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although {{he was born in}} South Carolina and reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available. After settling his accounts, he resigned from the U.S. Army on May 8, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Once the two ropes are lashed {{together}} {{around the}} binyeomok, the contest begins, to the shouts and cheers of the celebrants. The actual competition is short, with victory usually decided after a single pull (although some contests are played to best of three). Because {{of the association}} of the Western direction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> fertility and fecundity, the match is often fixed to ensure that the West team win (and thus ensure a bounteous harvest). After celebrating at the house of their team's captain, the winners will then proceed to the house of the losing team's captain to offer their commiserations; this often resembles a funeral procession. Both ropes are taken by the winning team, dissected and sold; the straw taken from them is believed to have unusual protective or nourishing properties.|$|E

5|$|Stelae became closely {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> divine kingship and declined {{at the same}} time as this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (c. 900–1521). The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
5|$|The RAWCF first {{examined}} a design by Captain Adrian Jones, who had produced the Boer War Cavalry Memorial {{a few years}} before, but his design was rejected. Next, the committee contacted the artists Sir Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker and Sir Aston Webb. Lutyens sent in three designs, each costed at less than £15,000 (less than £607,000 in 2009 terms), but they were felt to be too similar to the Cenotaph and to give insufficient prominence to the artillery. After the RAWCF insisted that a howitzer be prominently incorporated into the designs, Lutyens withdrew. Baker disagreed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> single service monuments, but submitted a proposal costed at over £25,000 (over £1,010,000 in 2009 terms), which was declined; Baker subsequently withdrew from the project. Webb declined to submit a proposal and also withdrew.|$|E

5|$|The farm {{combined}} {{a practical}} American business model <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a European country seat or manor, with cows being milked constantly, and with milk promptly chilled and bottled within five minutes, {{and shipped to}} stores in New York City each night. The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an advance payment retainer, a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it}} was paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing {{the effects of}} later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was {{far more important than}} the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E
