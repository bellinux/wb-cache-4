500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have so much fun with it. I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Nile Rodgers {{was chosen}} by Madonna as the {{producer}} of the album, {{with the approval of}} the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work {{as a member of the}} seventies band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, [...] "When I was making the record, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money so that I could work with him." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{exploding}} pustules {{were carefully}} rigged to burst on command. Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores. When {{the device was}} pressed, the pustule would burst. Filming the scenes was particularly arduous; he later noted [...] "I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head." [...] The X-Files director Frank Spotnitz remarked, [...] "When we saw the pustule bursting on film, we just laughed because it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> over-the-top grotesque." [...] The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver, which also served as Puerto Rico in season opener [...] "Little Green Men".

500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really {{came in and}} pushed it and made it even funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added. [...] Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, [...] "The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced." [...] They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the album}} was {{formulated}} during [...] "vibe sessions" [...] in which the group and producers would visit clubs in downtown Atlanta, select performers they saw, and invite them to the studio. [...] They would then [...] "sit around, smoke a few, drink a few", and create ideas for new songs. However, recording sessions became difficult as André 3000 grew tired of rapping on songs, which made Big Boi and the producers uneasy about how the music would sound. [...] To maintain musical cohesion with Big Boi while continuing to expand his vocal palette, André decided to combine rapping with soul-inspired crooning, which had {{a major influence on}} Stankonias sound. [...] "Snappin & Trappin'" [...] features a guest appearance from then-unknown rapper Killer Mike. The rapper noted that while working with OutKast, he used the opportunity to try to [...] "compete" [...] with the duo to improve his rapping skills. Big Boi was impressed with Killer Mike's abilities, noting, [...] "When I first heard him spit, his voice <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> commanding. [...] He's a very intelligent guy." ...|$|E

500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches. The album features three guesting vocalists: Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada on [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on [...] "Welcome to the Family", and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge on [...] "If It Means a Lot to You". The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record. The music <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> catchy on its own [...] so we said we will just set this aside for next time around." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{preparing}} {{it on his}} Logic recording software, Bilal recorded A Love Surreal in five months, {{which he}} said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Prime Rib Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play {{when he entered the}} studio, but, according to him, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> easy that the music started to flow ... by the fifth day we were like 'damn, we made a mistake and wrote five extra songs". He worked with most of the recording crew from Airtight's Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his 2001 debut 1st Born Second to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for the album's sound.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] was filmed in December 2004 in Los Angeles, California. It was co-directed by Spears and Billie Woodruff, who {{previously}} {{worked with her}} in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and in [...] "Overprotected". Spears described the shoot as [...] "hectic", adding it was filmed [...] "in a record-breaking five hours". She also commented about co-directing with Woodruff, saying that [...] "he had no ego whatsoever, and the whole process <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> much fun". Spears is credited as [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] in the video, as she said [...] "I kinda think she's like my alter ego whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney". The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from Juicy Couture. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, [...] "After doing about 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it".|$|E

500|$|... "Fishsticks" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The concept for [...] "Fishsticks" [...] began when Parker, fellow co-creator Matt Stone, and actor Bill Hader attended a writers' retreat in Seattle, Washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump. They started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually reminded them of the music video for rapper Kanye West's song [...] "Touch the Sky", in which West himself dresses like Knievel. This led to them picturing a scene with West on a news program, angrily denying reports that he is a fish, shouting [...] "No, I am not a salmon!" [...] During a four-hour ride in a car, Stone and Parker discussed the joke further, and eventually thought of the [...] "fishsticks" [...] joke that featured prominently in the final episode. The duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of the joke back and forth to each other {{for the rest of the}} ride. Stone said, [...] "The van driver we hired <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> bummed because we just kept talking about fishsticks, 'You're a gay fish', over and over. We thought it was so funny, and just the fact that he didn't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Csupó {{stated that}} they had no actors {{initially}} in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó [...] "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" [...] that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her." ...|$|E
500|$|Feminism {{academic}} Camille Paglia {{said that}} she used to be transfixed by this [...] "temperamental diva bitch", due to the contrast with the ideal of womanhood that she had been presented to as a child: [...] "Mary, this silent mother; and here was the witch queen who has this weird dialogue in the mirror and it didn't have to be charitable and it didn't have to be nice. I thought she was fabulous." [...] Likewise, Lana Parrilla, who later herself played the Evil Queen in Once Upon A Time, said that whenever she watched Disney's Snow White as a young girl she rooted for and [...] "loved the evil queen―every time the evil queen came on, I was like 'OK!' She <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> fascinating to me." [...] Author Deborah Lipp wrote: [...] "As I've said before and will doubtless say again, given a choice of being Snow White (helpless, sweet, voiceless) and the Wicked Queen, with the cool castle and the magic and the minions, give me my Magic Mirror now!" [...] Film director John Waters said he too rooted for the evil queen to win, and Chay Yew said that if he were a Disney character, he would be the evil queen from Snow White.|$|E

500|$|Before the Clash began {{recording}} {{their second}} album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound {{than its predecessor}} {{in order to reach}} American audiences. Sandy Pearlman, known for his work with Blue Öyster Cult, was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, [...] "ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album... it ruined any spontaneity." [...] Strummer agreed that [...] "it wasn't our easiest session." [...] Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, Give 'Em Enough Rope received largely positive reviews upon its November release. It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the Billboard chart. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking [...] "Tommy Gun", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and the Innocents. The series of concerts—there were more than thirty, from Edinburgh to Portsmouth—was promoted as the Sort It Out Tour. The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer's Body is the {{follow-up}} to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on Juno. In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> original, so imaginative", she stated. [...] "That's what it is about this script and the world is that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as." [...] Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.|$|E
500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News {{felt that}} Keys [...] "croons" [...] on the track's chorus line, [...] "I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets {{will make you}} feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you." [...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the first time, I was actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E
