Amongst those arrested was Thomas Maguire, a young Royal Marine on leave, who unfortunately for him had been {{in the vicinity of the}} attack on the police van and was Irish. Such was the zeal of the police that one man with a strong Irish accent surrendered himself to the magistrates [...] "as the only means I have of saving myself from being arrested over and over again <b>wherever</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> as a Fenian".|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers. She is highly credited for remaining one of country's most popular female artists for nearly four decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style. For many new artists, she has been credited as the inspiration to their careers in country music, including Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and LeAnn Rimes. She has also been credited as an inspiration to other performers such as Sara Evans, Kelly Clarkson, Lee Ann Womack, Terri Clark, Taylor Swift, and Carrie Underwood, The Net Music Countdown second-handedly reported, [...] "That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she's shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she's shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve." [...] McEntire also explained to the online website, [...] "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". [...] "It's always been my main career, and it's where my loyalties lie. I feel like I'm waving the flag of country music <b>wherever</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> and I couldn't be prouder to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. <b>Wherever</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that {{if it came to}} a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E

2500|$|After 1860 Charles Louis {{was able}} to come to Italy more freely. He visited Lucca with {{increasing}} frequency staying in the Villas of Montignoso and San Martino in Vignale. His wife, Maria Theresa, who lived in complete retirement as a nun in villa San Martino in Lucca died on 16 July 1879. Charles Louis was in Vienna at the time and only in October came to pay respect to her remains. His great granddaughter Archduchess Louise of Tuscany, later Crown Princess of Saxony, described him in her memoirs: [...] "My maternal great grandfather, Duke Charles of Parma and Lucca {{was one of the most}} amusing and original men. He had estates in Saxony, to which he retired when he became weary of court life. He was always a protestant at Meissen, where his favorite castle was situated, and when he was remonstrated with on the subject by his spiritual advisers he replied. 'when I go to Constantinople I shall be a Mohammedan; In fact <b>wherever</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> I always adopt, for the time being, the religion of the country, as it keeps me so much more intone with the local color scheme.'" ...|$|E

Occasionally I would see a horse; I do not wish to be unfair in this matter, there were riding horses sometimes within two or three miles of the ultimate front, but they were rarely used.|$|R
