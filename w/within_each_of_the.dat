5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. <b>Within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no system}} at Port Chicago for making sure {{officers}} {{and men were}} familiar with safety regulations.

Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier but not <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barracksKinne did not think the enlisted men would be able to comprehend such a list. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E

The census also identified a fall in the Romanian and Moldovan populations to 12.5% (114,600) and 7.3% (67,200), respectively.

25|$|By 1964, the Wilderness Act {{protected}} {{portions of}} the Sierra as primitive areas where humans are simply temporary visitors.

These wilderness areas include the John Muir Wilderness (protecting the eastern slope of the Sierra and the area between Yosemite and Kings Canyon Parks), and wilderness <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Parks. Because of the Wilderness Act and the rocky terrain in the area, plans to construct two trans-Sierra highways across {{this portion of the}} Sierra Escarpment, State Route 168 and State Route 190, were abandoned; the two highways each remain split as discontiguous segments {{on either side of the}} Sierra.|$|E

25|$|The pace of {{independence}} {{increased in the}} 1920s, led by Canada, which exchanged envoys with the United States in 1920 and concluded the Halibut Fisheries Treaty {{in its own right}} in 1923. In the Chanak crisis of 1922, the Canadian government insisted that its course of action would be determined by the Canadian parliament, not the British government, and, by 1925, the Dominions felt confident enough to refuse to be bound by Britain's adherence to the Treaty of Locarno. These developments, combined with a realisation that the Crown was already operating distinctly and separately <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurisdictions of the Canadian provinces and Australian states, appeared to put to rest previous assertions that the Crown could never be divided amongst the Dominions.|$|E
25|$|A {{common and}} {{somewhat}} naive {{definition of a}} polyhedron {{is that it is}} a solid whose boundary can be covered by finitely many planes or that it is a solid formed as the union of finitely many convex polyhedra. Natural refinements of this definition require the solid to be bounded, to have a connected interior, and possibly also to have a connected boundary. The faces of such a polyhedron can be defined as the connected components of the parts of the boundary <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planes that cover it, and the edges and vertices as the line segments and points where the two faces meet. However, the polyhedra defined in this way do not include the self-crossing star polyhedra, their faces may not form simple polygons, and some edges may belong to more than two faces.|$|E
25|$|Burj Khalifa was {{designed}} by Adrian Smith, then of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise {{the architecture of the}} project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa’s central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs <b>within</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.|$|E

40|$|The E 7 protein encoded {{by human}} {{papillomavirus}} type 16 shows transforming and immortalizing activities which are mediated, in part, through <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viral oncoprotein with the pRB protein family.
