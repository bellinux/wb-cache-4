5|$|Lad's mate Lady is {{run over}} {{and killed by}} a {{speeding}} driver who deliberately aimed his car at her. Lad and his owners both saw the crime, but were unable {{to catch up to}} the driver in time. Lad grieves terribly until they go to a local tennis tournament where he finds Lady's killer. He attacks the man to kill him, but the Master calls him off. The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady.|$|E
25|$|At the 9:28 point, {{the song}} {{transforms}} into a duet coda. The {{structure of the}} verses remains, but the woman now asks <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> would do. He answers in the affirmative {{for the first four}} sections.|$|E
500|$|Several players thought having over 150 players wearing number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day {{was far too}} many. [...] "This is {{supposed}} to be an honor", Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter told USA Today, [...] "and just a handful of guys wearing the number. Now you've got entire teams doing it. I think we're killing the meaning. It should be special wearing Jackie's number, not just because it looks cool." [...] Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia, who decried the lack of African-American players in the game in March 2007, told USA Today that [...] "It kind of waters it down. I could see the Dodgers since that was his team, but not everyone else." [...] "I didn't know so many guys planned to wear the number. I sure wasn't expecting whole teams to wear it", Griffey told the USA Today. [...] "But I'm not going to {{look at it as a}} negative. This is a tribute for <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> has done, a day to celebrate." [...] Garret Anderson, Los Angeles Angels left fielder, told the USA Today that he won't wear number 42 because [...] "I just don't feel I'm worthy of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Preceded by {{the single}} [...] "Listen to <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Said" [...] in May 1975, Venus and Mars {{appeared}} {{two weeks later}} to decent reviews and brisk sales. The album reached number 1 in the United States, the United Kingdom and other {{countries around the world}} (as did [...] "Listen to <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Said" [...] in the US) and sold 4 million copies worldwide. The reaction was less than what had greeted Band on the Run a year earlier, however.|$|E
2500|$|The {{semantic}} {{shift that}} underlies this evolution {{is more or}} less as follows: A speaker of Classical Latin might have said: vir est in foro, meaning [...] "the man is in/at the marketplace". The same sentence in Vulgar Latin could have been *(h)omo stat in foro, [...] "the man stands in/at the marketplace", replacing the est (from esse) with stat (from stare), because [...] "standing" [...] was what was perceived as <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was actually doing.|$|E

"circumstantial {{evidence}} indicates that he was born where he said he was, and that, in fact, The Interesting Narrative is reasonably accurate in its details, although, of course, {{subject to the same}} criticisms of selectivity and self-interested distortion that characterize the genre of autobiography."Lovejoy uses the name of Vassa in his article, since that was <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> used throughout his life, in [...] "his baptism, his naval records, marriage certificate and will". He emphasizes that Vassa only used his African name in his autobiography.|$|E
2500|$|Created {{following}} the McCartneys' 1971 album Ram, the band's first two albums, Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway (the latter featuring guitarist Henry McCullough), {{were viewed as}} artistic disappointments beside Paul McCartney's work with the Beatles. After {{the release of the}} title track of the James Bond movie Live and Let Die, McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973's Band on the Run, a commercial and critical success that spawned two top ten singles in [...] "Jet" [...] and the title track. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, only for Britton to quit shortly afterwards and be replaced by Joe English. With the new line-up, Wings released Venus and Mars, which included the US number one single [...] "Listen to <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Said", and undertook a highly successful world tour over 1975â€“76. Intended as more of a group effort, Wings at the Speed of Sound was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] and [...] "Let 'Em In".|$|E
2500|$|Wings began {{recording}} {{sessions for}} its next album in London in November 1974, {{then moved to}} New Orleans to complete Venus and Mars (1975), the first release from the group on Capitol Records. The album topped the charts and contained the US number 1 single [...] "Listen to <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> Said", which also featured Dave Mason, formerly of Traffic, on guitar and Tom Scott on saxophone. When the Venus and Mars recording sessions moved to New Orleans, Britton quit Wings {{and was replaced by}} Joe English who won the job at a secret audition before McCartney. In late 1975 Wings embarked on the Wings Over the World tour, following a postponement to allow McCulloch to recuperate from a hand fracture. Starting in Bristol, the tour took them to Australia (November), Europe (March 1976), the US (May/June), and Europe again (September), before ending in a four-night grand finale at London's Wembley Empire Pool. For this tour, added to Wings' stage act was a horn section consisting of Tony Dorsey, Howie Casey, Thaddeus Richard and Steve Howard, on saxes, brass and percussion.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} he came to compose his account of Malthus for The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt had {{acquired}} perspective and achieved a more balanced view of his subject. He notes {{at the outset that}} [...] "Mr. Malthus ... attained a scientific reputation in questions of moral and political philosophy." [...] There is no mistaking <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> stands for: [...] "In weighing his merits we come at once {{to the question of what}} he has done or failed to do." [...] We know immediately that we are speaking of his [...] "'Essay on Population' [...] distinct leading proposition" [...] which [...] "has changed the aspect of political economy in a decided and material point of view": the proposition [...] "that 'the population cannot go on perpetually increasing without pressing on the limits of the means of subsistence, and that a check of some kind or other must, sooner or later, be opposed to it.' This is the essence of the doctrine which Mr. Malthus has been the first to bring into general notice, and as we think, to establish beyond the fear of contradiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{discussions with}} the family are {{complete}} and satisfactory information about the woman is acquired then {{the family of the}} man will proceed to appoint marriage negotiators. It is these very negotiators that will travel to the family of the woman to make known the man and his intentions. Once the negotiators reach the family of the woman they will be kept in the kraal, inkundla, of the woman's family. If the family do not possess a kraal they will simply be kept outside the household as they {{will not be allowed to}} enter the household without the acknowledgement and acceptance of the woman's family. It is here where the lobola (dowry) negotiations will begin. The family of the woman will give them a bride-price and a date for which they must return to pay that price. The bride-price is dependent on numerous things such as her level of education, the wealth status of her family in comparison to that of the man's family, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> stands to gain in the marriage and the overall desirability of the woman. The payment of the bride-price could be in either cattle or money depending on the family of the woman. The modern Xhosa families would rather prefer money as most are situated in the urban cities where there would be no space nor permits for livestock.|$|E

6000|$|Thora laughed. [...] "Ay, lady; I ken well <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> say. How {{that poor}} youth is spell-bound, {{and that you}} are casting your glamour over him as of old over my poor old lady and little Master Bernard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'He'll pop to-day {{as sure as}} eggs, now he's {{taken them}} two glasses of popping powder,' said the girl, as he {{went out of the}} shop. 'Well, it's {{astonishing}} to me <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> find to be afraid of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} did he know that?" [...] James asked. [...] "I took care <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was not on deck, when we made {{the holes in the}} boat, and he does not {{understand}} a word of English, so he could not have overheard <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> said." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps not. We shall see. They {{had just}} begun a lawsuit about the diamonds,--to get them back. And then all at once,--they're stolen. It looks <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> call--fishy. I'm told that all the police in London are up about it." ...|$|R
50|$|Gene Simmons insulted Ivanka by {{brushing}} off her {{requests for}} a status report {{and asked her}} if she would tell Empresario <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were doing, accusing her of female solidarity in the process. Gene subsequently apologized to Ivanka in the boardroom.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice had}} been growing hoarser, {{and there was an}} uncomfortable silence when he stopped. This was not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> had expected, and {{everybody}} seemed to feel that there was something wrong. Then Ingleby looked at Leger with a little bitter smile.|$|R
