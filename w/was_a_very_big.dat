25|$|The canal in Muncy Creek Township brought {{vast amounts}} of goods that were stored in {{warehouses}} in Port Penn and Muncy. The farmers and industrialists of Lycoming County used these warehouses to store their goods before they were sent south on the canal. The chief exports of the county were hogs, wheat, flour, lumber, dried and salted meats, leather and whiskey. Whiskey <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> business. At least 13 distilleries in the area produced and out put of 1,200 to 1,500gallons of whiskey a day. Muncy Creek Township also was home to a thriving commercial fishing industry. The dam was an ideal point to catch fish. The bottleneck in the river caused by the dam and canal locks caused the fish to be forced into one easy to reach location. Baskets were placed along the dam and locks and tremendous amounts of fish and eels were easily caught. The dams and locks at Port Penn were destroyed by numerous floods in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley during the late 1800s. This caused the canal to be abandoned as it {{was replaced by the}} railroads. Port Penn was since faded away. There are several homes in the area, but as a hamlet it no longer exists. Parts of Port Penn have been annexed by the borough of Muncy and others are in Muncy Creek Township. Lycoming College and the Muncy Historical Society have spearheaded an effort to uncover the history of Port Penn.|$|E

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

2500|$|Jean DuShon {{was one of}} {{the singers}} who was {{originally}} tapped by Ron Miller to demo the song as he was fine-tuning the composition. Miller was impressed by DuShon's rendition, and her version, produced by Esmond Edwards, was issued as a single on Chess Records' Cadet label in October 1966. It was chosen [...] "Pick Hit of the Week" [...] by Detroit's WXYZ radio. [...] Although the record label gave the sole songwriting credit to Murden, Motown CEO Berry Gordy discovered that Miller – who was contracted to Motown – had co-written the song, and reportedly asked Chess not to promote the single. DuShon dropped [...] "For Once in My Life" [...] from her nightclub act and later said: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> disappointment in my life. I stopped singing it ‘cause I didn’t have the song. I didn’t have anything. It wasn’t mine anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upset with Columbia's {{promotion}} department, Springsteen {{said the}} decision to label him as the [...] "future of rock <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> mistake and I would like to strangle the guy who thought that up."

Now fearing the hype might backfire, Columbia suspended all press interviews with Springsteen. When the hype died down, sales tapered off and the album was off the chart after 29 weeks. But the album had established a solid national fan base for Springsteen which he would build on with each subsequent release.|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>big</b> part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and she told me about lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E
