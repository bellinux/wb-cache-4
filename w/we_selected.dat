500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era I want to look at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some. Then I played Tommy a couple that I'd written, and he said, 'Whoa, that's a great idea,' so <b>we</b> <b>selected</b> a couple of those. [...] We all made suggestions, and we took all those suggestions to the studio." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} check if, in {{addition}} to differences in occupational structure, the public administration displays high skill intensity also within occupations, <b>we</b> <b>select</b> certain occupational categories. We do so because making cross sectoral comparisons within occupations that are not homogeneously distributed across sectors {{are likely to be}} misleading (for instance, the tiny amount of education workers in the multinational sector are likely to be essentially different than the large amount of public sector educational workers; comparisons between them are likely to be potentially misleading). We will thus focus on occupations that are roughly proportionately distributed across sectors: among management <b>we</b> <b>select</b> company directors; as scientists and technicians <b>we</b> <b>select</b> scientific and other occupations; and as clerical jobs <b>we</b> <b>select</b> both subcategories.|$|R

Later, GamesRadar included her in the list of [...] "The 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years". Joystiq named her their favorite character of the Final Fight series, stating that her [...] "hypersexualized appearance and random flipping" [...] made the character memorable, and that the controversy over her gender made the character even more so.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>selected</b> for our victim {{the only}} child of a {{prominent}} citizen named Ebenezer Dorset. The father was respectable and tight, a mortgage fancier and a stern, upright collection-plate passer and forecloser. The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief freckles, and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news-stand when you want to catch a train. Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent. But wait till I tell you.|$|E
