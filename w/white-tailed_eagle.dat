5|$|The {{bald eagle}} forms a species pair with the Eurasian <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle.</b> This species pair {{consists}} of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles {{at the beginning of}} the Early Miocene (c. 10Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.|$|E

25|$|The {{territory}} of the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> ranges between , normally in sheltered coastal locations. Sometimes they are found inland by lakes and along rivers. Territory of white-tailed eagles can overlap {{with those of the}} golden eagle but competition between the two species is limited. Golden eagles prefer mountains and moorland, while the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> prefers the coast and the sea. In adulthood, the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> has no natural predators and is thus considered an apex predator.|$|E

25|$|<b>White-tailed</b> <b>eagles</b> {{are sexually}} mature at {{four to five}} years of age. They pair for life, though if one dies {{replacement}} can occur quickly. A bond is formed when a permanent home range is chosen. They have a characteristic aerial courtship display which culminates in the pair locking talons mid-air and whirling earthwards in series of spectacular cartwheels. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>eagles</b> are much more vocal than golden eagles, particularly during the breeding season and especially the male when near the eyrie. Calls can sometimes {{take the form of a}} duet between the pair.|$|R
25|$|The area {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vegetation zones going from the sand communities of the coastline towards the forests of the mainland. The forest includes beech (Fagus sylvatica), birch (Betula pubescens), alder (Alnus glutinosa), pine and oak. It is an important way station for migrating waderbirds and waterbirds such as geese, ducks and swans. The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus albicilla) and other birds nest at the site.|$|E
25|$|While Norway, Germany, Poland and Iceland harboured {{the largest}} {{surviving}} populations, pockets of reproducing pairs remained {{in several other}} countries. Intense conservation actions {{throughout much of the}} remaining European distribution range (legal protection to decrease hunting, protection of breeding sites, and winter feeding) led to recovery of many local populations. Since the 1980s, the European <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> population has recovered steadily and is spreading back westward. It has today recolonised several traditional breeding areas in Europe. This ongoing recovery is assisted in Scotland and Ireland by reintroduction schemes.|$|E
25|$|White-tailed eagles were {{successfully}} reintroduced to the Isle of Rum, in the Small Isles archipelago in Scotland, in 1975 and now breeds throughout the Western Isles and the mainland coast of Wester Ross. It has many Gaelic names, including iolar sùil na grèine or 'eagle of the sun's eye.' In August 2008, fifteen chicks raised in Norway were released at a secret location in Fife, in expectation of reintroducing the species {{to the east}} coast of Scotland as well. The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> is still a rare breeder in Britain following its extinction and reintroduction, with 36 pairs in 2006 and 40 in 2008.|$|E

50|$|A {{breeding}} pair of <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagles</b> first nested {{on an island}} in Lough Derg in 2012. This marked a great success for the Irish reintroduction programme started {{in the summer of}} 2007.|$|R
25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being common ringed plover, ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
25|$|The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> {{is being}} reintroduced to Ireland, where its Irish name of Iolar Mara (sea eagle) {{reflects}} its historic {{association with the}} island's long coast. The program was begun {{in the summer of}} 2007. Fifteen to twenty young eagles from Norway are being released each spring into the Killarney National Park in the south-west of Ireland. This comprehensive project will last a number of years, with many more eagles being released. The species has a rich history on the island but became extinct in Ireland in the 1900s due to persecution from landowners. The last pair bred on the coast of Mayo in 1912.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2006, it was {{announced}} that a pair of white-tailed eagles breeding in the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve in the Netherlands had arrived on their own, not as a reintroduction. This {{was the first time the}} bird has bred in the Netherlands in living memory. In 2007, 2008 and 2009 the eagles returned to their nest. In 2010, it turned out that the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> was also breeding in the Zwarte Meer nature district and in the Lauwersmeer area. There is also a confirmed case of breeding white-tailed eagles in the Biesbosch. Currently (2017), there are around ten pairs breeding spread over the country.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{was identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of greylag and barnacle geese, common eiders, common loons, great cormorants, European shags, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagles,</b> purple sandpipers and black guillemots.|$|R
50|$|The heath {{is home to}} red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, {{wild boar}} and, more recently, wolves {{migrating}} from Poland. The numerous ponds offer habitats to water birds as well as otters, beavers, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagles</b> and ospreys.|$|R
5000|$|A {{breeding}} complex {{was established}} in the zoo's affiliate [...] "Cīruļi" [...] in 2000. <b>White-tailed</b> <b>eagles,</b> lesser spotted eagles, peregrine falcons, barn owls and Eurasian eagle-owls are bred to reintroduce these species in Latvia and extend existing populations.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle,</b> peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E
25|$|The diet of wildcats in Great Britain varies geographically; {{in eastern}} Scotland, {{lagomorphs}} make up 70% of their diet, {{while in the}} west, 47% consists of small rodents. In Western Europe, the wildcat feeds on hamsters, brown rats, dormice, water voles, voles, and wood mice. From time to time, small carnivores (martens, polecats, stoats, and weasels) are preyed upon, {{as well as the}} fawns of red deer, roe deer, and chamois. In the Carpathians, the wildcat feeds primarily on yellow-necked mice, red-backed voles, and ground voles. European hares are also taken on occasion. In Transcarpathia, the wildcat's diet consists of mouse-like rodents, galliform birds, and squirrels. Wildcats in the Dnestr swamps feed on small voles, water voles, and birds, while those living in the Prut swamps primarily target water voles, brown rats, and muskrats. Birds taken by Prut wildcats include warblers, ferruginous ducks, coots, spotted crakes, and gadwalls. In Moldavia, the wildcat's winter diet consists primarily of rodents, while birds, fish, and crayfish are eaten in summer. Brown rats and water voles, as well as muskrats and waterfowl are the main sources of food for wildcats in the Kuban delta. Wildcats in the northern Caucasus feed on mouse-like rodents and edible dormice, as well as birds on rare occasions. On rare occasions, young chamois and roe deer, are also attacked. Wildcats on the Black Sea coast are thought to feed on small birds, shrews, and hares. On one occasion, the feathers of a <b>white-tailed</b> <b>eagle</b> and the skull of a kid were found at a den site. In Transcaucasia, the wildcat's diet consists of gerbils, voles, birds, and reptiles in the summer, and birds, mouse-like rodents, and hares in winter. Turkmenian wildcats feed on great and red-tailed gerbils, Afghan voles, thin-toed ground squirrels, Tolai hares, small birds (particularly larks), lizards, beetles, and grasshoppers. Near Repetek, the wildcat is responsible for destroying over 50% of nests made by desert finches, streaked scrub warblers, red-tailed warblers, and turtledoves. In the Qarshi steppes of Uzbekistan, the wildcat's prey, in descending order of preference, includes great and red-tailed gerbils, jerboas, other rodents and passerine birds, reptiles, and insects. Wilcats in eastern Kyzyl Kum have similar prey preferences, with the addition of tolai hares, midday gerbils, five-toed jerboas, and steppe agamas. In Kyrgyzstan, the wildcat's primary prey varies from tolai hares near Issyk Kul, pheasants in the Chu and Talas valleys, and mouse-like rodents and gray partridges in the foothills. In Kazakhstan's lower Ili, the wildcat mainly targets rodents, muskrats, and Tamarisk gerbils. Occasionally, remains of young roe deer and wild boar are present in its faeces. After rodents, birds follow in importanance, along with reptiles, fish, insects, eggs, grass stalks and nuts (which probably enter the cat's stomach through pheasant crops). In west Africa, the wildcat feeds on rats, mice, gerbils, hares, small to medium-sized birds (up to francolins), and lizards. In southern Africa, where wildcats attain greater sizes than their western counterparts, antelope fawns and domestic stock, such as lambs and kids are occasionally targeted.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{wildlife}} {{can be found}} on the island, mammals such as Red deer, Roe deer, Otter, Harbour seal and American mink are predominant. The steep mountain sides of the island also contain a number of nesting <b>White-tailed</b> <b>eagles.</b>|$|R
