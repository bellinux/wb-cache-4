25|$|The {{connection}} between the two flights at Logan International Airport was within Terminal B, but the two gates were not connected within security. Passengers must leave the secured area, go outdoors, cross a covered roadway, and enter another building before going through security once again.

500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} mode received mixed response. Carter {{compared the}} competitive multiplayer {{to that of}} Tomb Raider, and called it [...] "skippable". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations.

Bertz from Game Informer also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized {{the lack of a}} large player pool and dedicated servers. Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget. In contrast, GameZone's Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was [...] "a surprise" [...] for him.

Another historian notes that Grant's troops [...] "had performed prodigies of valor and endurance during the campaign" [...] and had learned from it that [...] "hard fighting would bring success." [...] As {{a result of the}} campaign's conspicuous success, Grant, McClernand, Smith, and Wallace were all promoted to the rank of major general of volunteers.

Instead, we should take only Kon's [...] "original concept", and let somebody turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person's work, and I'm OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon." ...|$|E

500|$|Series creator Damian Kindler {{conceived}} the pilot in 2001. When {{he became a}} Stargate SG-1 writer, he later asked Martin Wood, a director from the same show, if there was potential for a series, which Wood believed there was. A few years later, Kindler asked Amanda Tapping {{to take part in}} the project, and she accepted. Sanctuary originally started as an eight-part bi-weekly web series in 2007, produced by Vancouver-based Stage 3 Media. The producers of the series were looking to expand the series on other mediums, including television. Due to the success of the web series, in January2008, the Sci Fi Channel announced the commissioning of a first season of 13 episodes. The move to television has allowed the producers to widen the scope for the season. According to actress and executive producer Amanda Tapping, the season [...] "is very different from what you've seen on the Web".

500|$|Even without {{gravitational}} evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, {{has argued}} that Sedna's 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth-sized object exists beyond Neptune. Sedna's orbit is so eccentric that it spends {{only a small fraction}} of its orbital period near the Sun, where it can be easily observed. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Mike Brown noted that [...] "Sedna is about three-quarters the size of Pluto. If there are sixty objects three-quarters the size of Pluto [...] then there are probably forty objects the size of Pluto...If there are forty objects the size of Pluto, then there are probably ten that are twice the size of Pluto. There are probably three or four that are three times the size of Pluto, and the biggest of these objects... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth." [...] However, he notes that, should such an object be found, even though it might approach Earth in size, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dwarf planet by the current definition, because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently.|$|E
500|$|Livermorane (LvH2) {{would be}} the {{heaviest}} chalcogen hydride and the heaviest homolog of water (the lighter ones being H2S, H2Se, H2Te, and PoH2). Polane (polonium hydride) is a more covalent compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between metals and metalloids and has some nonmetallic properties: it is intermediate between a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride (HCl) and a metal hydride like stannane (SnH4). Livermorane should continue this trend: {{it should be a}} hydride rather than a livermoride, but <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> covalent molecular compound..

This phenomenon, dubbed [...] "supervalent hybridization", is not particularly uncommon in non-relativistic regions in the periodic table; for example, molecular calcium difluoride has 4s and 3d involvement from the calcium atom. The heavier livermorium dihalides are predicted to be linear, but the lighter ones are predicted to be bent.|$|E

In interviews before its release, Fightstar called the new album [...] "quite different" [...] from their previous releases; Charlie Simpson said that they wanted to experiment with a [...] "rock opera" [...] sound, including strings and a choir. Simpson said that although it might be different, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Fightstar album with their trademark dark, heavy elements.

500|$|When the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was allowed to choose which lines to keep and which to abandon. The line between Avondale and Brecon still saw heavy freight traffic, and there <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reasonable amount of traffic to Mason and Hempstead. Thus Conrail bought about half of the ex-CL, including the main line from Cincinnati to Brecon (Blue Ash Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to Pasadena (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP Industrial Track), as well as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to Clement (Clement Running Track). Ownership of the remaining lines—Brecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junction—remained with the Penn Central trustees, although, with local funding, Conrail operated the two segments from Hageman to Lebanon and Centerville to Hempstead as [...] "light density lines". Tracks between Lytle and Centerville were torn up in 1979. Since then, several more segments have been abandoned, including Avondale to McCullough and Centerville to Kettering. Short line Indiana and Ohio Railway (IORY) acquired most of the remainder in the 1980s, beginning operations from Monroe (near Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has bought the Hageman-Lebanon segment, initially owned by the Penn Central trustees, and the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority {{acquired the}} property between McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed public transit line. (IORY continues to operate freight on both of these segments.) The IORY began running tourist trains on the Lebanon segment in 1985. The passenger operations were split in 1996, going through several renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, and finally Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad. Three short segments of line at Middletown and Dayton remained with Conrail until its 1999 breakup, when the Norfolk Southern Railway acquired Conrail's assets in southwestern Ohio.|$|E
