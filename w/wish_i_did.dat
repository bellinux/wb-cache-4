Lifted had produced the beat in November 2011, and his manager was responsible for playing the beat to West which led to him wanting to work with Lifted. Furthermore, Kanye played the embryotic version to Anthony [...] "The Twilite Tone" [...] Khan and additional production was done including {{but not limited to}} samples and the part in which Kanye raps over. [...] Both Pusha T and Big Sean recorded their verses in January 2012 and the song was mixed and finalized in March. Producer Hit-Boy, known for producing West's [...] "Niggas in Paris", commented that [...] "It's fresh, it's new, it's something you haven't heard before. It's elements of trap, but it's just some fresh, new-sounding stuff. I'm excited about it. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, but I didn't".|$|E

6000|$|... "Miles," [...] Lucy, at length, {{broke the}} silence, by saying--"I <b>wish,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>wish</b> {{we had not}} met that other sloop this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to say that I am {{interested}} in the case, and that you have all my good <b>wishes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like to offer pecuniary help." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{explained}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know her, and though <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{because she was}} so pretty, it would not perhaps be quite right to go to her house to see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> Morris, and you {{may believe}} me there, for {{it would be a}} small sum in my pocket; but the fact is, I don't," [...] said Michael.|$|E
6000|$|... "No more I know, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> [...] And I {{would tell}} {{it all to}} you; [...] For what became of this poor child [...] There's none that ever knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet!" [...] he begged. [...] "It's early. You say I don't {{understand}} you, Janet--my God, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did!</b> It breaks me {{all up to}} see you cry like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{do not say}} so!' exclaimed Louis; 'I have {{deserved}} far less-idle, ungrateful, careless of your <b>wishes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know}} <b>I</b> could pain you so much, or I {{would not have done}} it. You have forgiven often, say you forgive now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{is one to}} word one's prayer, or {{how even}} to word one's <b>wishes?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what is the wrong that <b>I</b> have <b>done.</b> <b>I</b> say it boldly; in this matter I cannot see my own fault. I have simply found that I have been a fool." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not?" [...] {{she said}} helplessly. [...] "I don't know. Perhaps {{that is what}} I do wish. Ah, but what are wishes! I know now that they don't matter at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Tom! I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{know where}} you have gone!" [...] said Fred, shaking his head sadly as he gazed on the floor, and taking no notice {{whatever}} of the threatening action of his visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{do nothing}} until we hear from the solicitor. In the {{meantime}} you may stay with us, if you <b>wish.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect a visit from you so soon; but your room has not been used since you went away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was a joke! but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> hadn't <b>done</b> it. It seemed {{at the moment that}} I should look to be cross if <b>I</b> didn't <b>do</b> as he bade me. But when he had said that about being at home--! Oh, Mrs. Roden, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had not <b>done</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Morton laughed, rather sadly. [...] "That's a fine, womanly reason, {{and may be}} {{sufficient}} for you; but, if you go, understand, Kate, it is against my <b>wish.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not care to know anything more about her and her problems; she has interfered too much with my work already." ...|$|R
6000|$|The little white-haired lady {{smiled at}} him. [...] "Then," [...] she said, [...] "if it is any comfort to you, {{you have my}} good <b>wishes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what Maud's {{decision}} will be, {{but that is the}} spirit which would have induced me to listen in times long gone by!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Devil take you,' {{interrupted}} Jonas, {{but in a}} suppressed voice still; 'what harm do {{you suppose}} she has come to? I know no more where she is than you do; I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Wait till she comes home, and see; she can't be long. Will that content you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But you--you {{really do}} belong here. You {{seem to have}} absorbed all the {{clearness}} of it, and the strength and vigour. I was watching you this morning, and you were so utterly {{out of place in}} those surroundings." [...] Victoria paused, her colour deepening.|$|E
6000|$|Stacy curled a {{fighting}} lip rather superciliously. [...] "No; I don't think THAT--I rather <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> It's the blessed chunks of solid gold {{that seem to}} have got US fast, don't you know, and are going to stick to us for good or ill. A sort of Frankenstein monster that we've picked out of a hole from below." ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Ragnall {{asked me}} what <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> replied that I would rather go on, but that I was in his hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was enchanted," [...] said Lothair, [...] "and desire {{nothing but}} to be ever subject to such remarks. But this affair of the cathedral, it is your own thought--I would fain hope your own wish, for unless it were your own <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>I</b> ever {{should be able to}} {{accomplish}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It shall depend entirely upon you. And yet I {{ought not}} to ask you. <b>I</b> ought to <b>do</b> as these people bid me without even troubling you for an {{expression}} of your <b>wish.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that when you become my wife, you will have as complete a right to the title as has Lady Kingsbury to hers. Shall it be so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "like me. I don't {{believe in}} dreams, either--I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did!</b> But it's not in {{me to believe}} in superstitions; I'm too hard--and I'm sorry for it. I have seen people who were comforted by their superstitions; happy people, possessed of faith. Don't you even believe that dreams are {{sometimes}} fulfilled by chance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't, upon my word--I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I wish I {{had a large}} {{acquaintance}} {{here with}} all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be so {{glad to have you}} dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an odd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{look like}} Mother either. She was tiny and dark--she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair. Oh, I {{remember}} her look so well. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> resemble her. I loved her so--I {{would have done}} anything to save her suffering and trouble. At least, she died in peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> hadn't come!" [...] she lamented. [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> hadn't. <b>Do</b> you s'pose mamma will be dreadfully angry? Won't you 'splain to her? You will, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very clear, my estimable friend," [...] {{answered}} Leonard, controlling his wrath {{as best he}} might. [...] "But {{for your}} sake I hope that the hour will never come when you shall be in mine, for then I may remember more than you <b>wish.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not in the least}} understand what you are aiming at, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> much care so long as a certain person is protected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know," [...] <b>I</b> declared truthfully. [...] "There is no man whom I am more anxious to see." ...|$|R
6000|$|Said Kim in English, distressed for the lama's agony: 'I {{think if}} you will let me go now we will walk away quietly and not steal. We will look for that River like before I was caught. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come here to find the Red Bull and {{all that sort of}} thing. I do not want it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{scarcely}} know of what,' {{replied the}} girl. 'I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and {{a fear that}} has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.' ...|$|E
60|$|That was how {{he killed}} his first deer. How the others were taken I do not know; I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> since this one exploit of a Wiltshire {{shepherd}} has more interest for me than I find in fifty narratives of elephants slaughtered wholesale with explosive bullets, written for the delight and astonishment of the reading public by our most glorious Nimrods.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} pleasant {{this fine}} day; something very new and interesting, for the wind {{makes me feel}} frisky and gay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> something," [...] said Nat, with a sigh, as Franz {{leaned over}} the sofa, and softly stroked Aunt Jo's hot forehead.|$|R
6000|$|... "The others {{told me you}} had a headache. I'm {{very sorry}} to hear that. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} {{to make you feel}} better." ...|$|R
