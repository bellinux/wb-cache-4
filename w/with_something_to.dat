25|$|Having {{lost the}} Test {{series on the}} {{previous}} Saturday, the mid-week Lions came to Eden Park <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> prove. Refereed by New Zealander Steve Walsh, the match was marked by the Lions' inability to find touch and Auckland's willingness to attack and run the angles. Auckland gave up some guaranteed points from early penalties to take the Lions on in set piece play. Auckland tighthead prop John Afoa was denied a try after a tap and run saw him held up in goal. A series of handling errors throughout the first half let Auckland down and saw the Lions to a 14–3 lead at the half. The second half saw the Lions give away points to a stoic Auckland pack and the scoreline was narrowed to 14–13 Lions lead. A late Ronan O'Gara penalty saw the Lions extend to a 4-point winning margin of 17–13. This victory completed an impressive clean sweep of matches for the mid week Lions against host Unions throughout New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, Pressman and St. Martin's Press had {{received}} approximately two dozen letters from Erhard's attorney Walter Maksym, though Erhard's representatives {{had yet to}} see the book itself. Maksym told the San Francisco Daily Journal in March 1993 {{that he wanted to}} [...] "fact check the book", because he believed that [...] "this is a first-time unknown author who apparently has interviewed only people who have negative things to say", and stated [...] "We have cautioned the publisher that they are responsible for the accuracy of the book." [...] Charlie Spicer, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, described the actions of Erhard's representatives with regard to the book as [...] "a desperate campaign by someone <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide".

You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV found {{influences}} of Gaga's past videos {{in the various}} avatars she plays You and I. She explained that: when [...] stands at a crossroads in a big hat, the image is reminiscent of 'Telephone' Gaga. When she sits nearly makeup-free at her piano in the cornfields, there are touches of the teary-eyed makeup-less Gaga from the 'Bad Romance' video. Flashes of her wedding may remind fans of the wedding dress she wore in the 'Judas' clip. Robot Gaga's facial structures recall some of the steampunk looks of her 'Alejandro' video. Those {{are only a few}} of the nods to past personae from her own videography. Devin Brown of CBS News felt that Gaga had finally returned to form with the video. [...] "After some visually pleasing but generally lackluster videos, she has finally come out <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> write home about. 'You and I' is arguably the best song on her sophomore release, Born This Way, and now has a video to match." [...] A Slant Magazine writer commented that the publication had a mixed reaction to the video, saying that it [...] "is essentially a collection of disconnected images we couldn't make heads or tails of." ...|$|E
500|$|On release, {{the song}} {{received}} near unanimous critical praise. Paul Morley of the NME wrote, [...] "'This Charming Man' is an accessible bliss, and seriously moving. This group fully {{understand that the}} casual is not enough ... This {{is one of the}} greatest singles of the year, a poor compliment. Unique and indispensable, like 'Blue Monday' and 'Karma Chameleon' – that's better!" [...] A contemporary review in The Face asked, [...] "Where has all the wildness and daring got to? Some of it has found its way onto the Smiths' record, 'This Charming Man'. It jangles and crashes and Morrissey jumps in the middle with his mutant choir-boy voice, sounding jolly and angst-ridden at the same time. It should be given out on street corners to unsuspecting passers-by of all ages." [...] Another contemporary review by Treble magazine described the song as a [...] "stellar jangle-pop track," [...] based on one of Marr's first truly iconic guitar licks. While the band was little-known in the United States at the time, Robert Palmer of The New York Times described the song as [...] "sparkling, soaring, superlative pop-rock, and proof that the guitar-band format pioneered by the Beatles is still viable for groups <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say". The following year, Palmer chose the song as the second best single of 1984.|$|E

Steve Dollar of Newsday wrote that [...] "he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys." [...] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, [...] "or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Janet Jackson has managed to emerge a [...] "superstar" [...] in her own right, rivaling not only several female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while [...] "successfully [...] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult." [...] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the [...] "Queen of Pop". Klein argued that [...] "stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet—Miss Jackson, if you're nasty—would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.".|$|E

2500|$|Although James are an {{alternative}} rock and indie rock band, and Wah Wah is characterized as an experimental rock album, {{the album is}} sometimes seen as an electronic dance and ambient album. Joseph Gallivan of The Independent described it as [...] "mainly electronic, and features lead singer Tim Booth experimenting with freely associative lyrics in a falsetto voice." [...] Emma Forrest of the NME took the album {{to be more of}} a textural record, saying [...] "it's an ambient album, <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hook onto - moving wallpaper in the nicest possible sense. It's one of the few genuinely engaging dance albums around." [...] Besides the NME, Amost Cool, Entertainment Weekly and Q also considered it an ambient album, but the latter also noted that [...] "like all such jams, [...] the band perm grooves, riffs, chants, licks and lyrical snatches in various stages of dress but still too naked to leave the house." [...] They also considered the album to contain Eno's industrial dance sound. The Sheffield Electronic Press characterized the album as featuring an [...] "experimental dance dynamic," [...] whilst another journalist of NME later said the album contained [...] "techno experiments". Tim Peacock of Record Collector considered the jams to be [...] "Can-style." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the premiere}} {{episode of the}} second season, [...] "Amok Time", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the Enterprise to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T'Pring (Arlene Martel). She rather wishes to be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal-if-fee fight instead, and selects Kirk as her champion, who unknowingly agrees to a {{fight to the death}} with Spock. McCoy persuades T'Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him inject Kirk <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{alleviate}} the issues with Vulcan's thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T'Pring that it was all a game of logic which would let her be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.|$|E
2500|$|Wood {{hoped to}} make a profit {{producing}} coins for use in Ireland and America. During the first half of 1722 the king's mistress, the Duchess of Kendal, obtained a patent from the Earl of Sunderland for coining copper money for Ireland. This was a means of providing her <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> live on after the death of the king. [...] Wood thought this would be a profitable enterprise so he purchased the royal patent from the duchess for £10,000. In his indenture from George I dated 16 June 1722, Wood was authorized to produce up to 360 tons of halfpence and farthings for Ireland at 30 pence to the pound over a period of fourteen years for an annual fee of £800 paid to the king. These Hibernia coins, which were minted in Phoenix Street, Seven Dials from January 1722, were heavier and thus intrinsically more valuable than the coppers then circulating in Ireland. They were certainly less profitable for Wood to mint than his lighter weight Rosa Americana issues (Hibernias weighed sixty halfpence to the pound as compared to 120 Rosa Americana halfpence to the pound). When including the costs of production and the £10,000 fee paid to the Duchess of Kendal, P. Mossman has calculated Wood would have lost £4,871 over the fourteen years of the patent. Thus from Wood's standpoint the Hibernia coin specifications were too generous based on the cost of production.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to mixed to positive reviews from music critics, although the low {{profile of the}} release saw it ignored in certain quarters. One biographer later noted [...] "some reviewers missed {{the concept of the}} album and were puzzled as to why James were releasing it at all." [...] Reviewing the album before release in mid-July 1994, Joseph Gallivan of The Independent was favourable, saying [...] "a little bit of confusion is good for us all." [...] Emma Forrest of the NME rated the album seven out of ten, saying [...] "it's an ambient album, <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hook onto - moving wallpaper in the nicest possible sense. It's one of the few genuinely engaging dance albums around." [...] Less favourable in the British press were Q, with Mat Snow giving the album two stars out of five and saying [...] "though no more than four tracks (especially Tomorrow and Jam J) out of a whopping 23 are anything like individually satisfactory, each is pregnant with a certain possibility, suggesting fully-fledged James tunes to come. Meanwhile, buffed up with Brian Eno's signature opiated industrial dance sound and accumulating in mood over an hour, they total an intriguingly unfocused ambient experience." [...] Besides critics, one biographer noted [...] "there was little to appeal to the more casual James fan {{in the rest of the}} album. For the more committed, it provided a previously unseen insight into the band's working methods." [...] Select ranked the album at number 45 in their list of the top 50 albums of 1994.|$|E
