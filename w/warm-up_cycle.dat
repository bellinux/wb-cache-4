40|$|Although fat is the {{principal}} fuel for flight in moths and butterflies, some use of carbohydrate fuels during activity would be predicted on energetic and biochemical grounds, particularly in nectivores. The present study evaluates the use of carbohydrate fuels during pre-flight warm-up in the endothermic sphinx moth Manduca sexta (L.). Carbohydrate content of moths was measured at intermediate points during the pre-flight <b>warm-up</b> <b>cycle</b> and at take-off. Muscle glycogen content declined during the initial phases of warm-up, whereas glucose and trehalose concentrations were unchanged. Abdominal carbohydrates were not mobilized during warm-up. Energy budget analysis suggests that glycogen oxidation supplies about 39 % of the energy needed for the initial phase of warm-up and about 6 % of {{the total cost of}} warm-up. Glycogen use during warm-up may be correlated with the capacity for endothermic warm-up at low ambient temperatures. Carbohydrates appear to be moi'e important as fuels for activity in some lepidopterans than has been previously reported for other members of this diverse Order...|$|E
40|$|There has {{recently}} been an increased emphasis on reducing energy consumption in manufacturing, driven by the fluctuations in energy costs and the growing importance given to environmental impact of manufactured goods. Lots of {{attention has been given}} to the reduction of machine tools energy consumption, as they require large amounts of energy to perform manufacturing tasks. One area that has received relatively little interest, yet could harness great potential, is reducing energy consumption by planning machine activities between manufacturing operations, while the machine is not in use. The intuitive option [...] which is currently exploited in manufacturing [...] is to leave the machine in a normal operating state in anticipation of the next manufacturing job. However, this is far from optimal due to the thermal deformation phenomenon, which usually require an energy-intensive <b>warm-up</b> <b>cycle</b> in order to bring all the components (e. g. spindle motor) into a suitable (stable) state for actual machining. Evidently, the use of this strategy comes with the associated commercial and environmental repercussions. In this paper, we investigate the exploitability of automated planning techniques for planning machine activities between manufacturing operations. We present a PDDL 2. 2 formulation of the task that considers energy consumption, thermal deformation, and accuracy. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a case study which considers real-world data...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the increasingly widespread use of catalytic converters for meeting automotive exhaust emission regulations considerable attention is currently being directed towards improving their performance. Experimental analysis is costly and time consuming. A desirable alternative is computational modelling. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} fully integrated computational model for simulating monolith type automotive catalytic converters. Two commercial CFD codes, PHOENICS and STAR-CD, were utilised to implement established techniques for modelling the flow field in catalyst assemblies. To appraise the accuracy of the flow field predictions an isothermal steady flow rig was designed and developed. A selection of axisymmetric inlet diffusers and 180 o expansions were tested, with the velocity profile across the monolith, the wall static pressure distribution along the inlet section and the total pressure drop across the assembly being measured. These datum sets were compared with predictions using a variety of turbulence models and solution algorithms. The closest agreement was achieved with a two-layer near wall approach, coupled to the fully turbulent version of the RNG k-ε model, and a nominally second order differencing scheme. Even with these approaches the predicted velocity profiles were too flat, the maximum velocity being as much as 17. 5 % too low. Agreement on pressure drops was better, the error being consistently less than 10 %. These results illustrate that present modelling techniques are insufficiently reliable for accurate predictions. It is suggested that the major reason for the relatively poor performance of these techniques is the neglecting of channel entrance effects in the monolith pressure drop term. Despite these weaknesses it was possible to show that the model reproduces the correct trends, and magnitude of change, in pressure drop and velocity distributions as the catalyst geometry changes. The PHONETICS flow field model was extended to include the heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions associated with catalysts. The methodology is based on an equivalent continuum approach. The result is a reacting model capable of simulating the three-dimensional distribution of solid and gas temperatures, species concentrations and flow field variables throughout the monolith mat and the effects that moisture has on the transient warm-up of the monolith. To assess the reacting model’s accuracy use was made of published light-off data from a catalyst connected to a test bed engine. Comparison with predicted results showed that the model was capable of reproducing the correct type, and time scales, of temperature and conversion efficiency behaviour during the <b>warm-up</b> <b>cycle.</b> From these predictions it was possible to show that the flow distribution across the monolith can significantly change during light-off. Following the identification, and subsequent modelling, of the condensation and evaporation of water during the warm-up process it was possible to show that, under the catalyst conditions tested, these moisture effects do not affect light-off times. Conditions under which moisture might affect light-off have been suggested. Although the general level of model accuracy may be acceptable for studying many catalyst phenomena, known deficiencies in the reaction kinetics used, errors in the flow field predictions, uncertainty over many of the physical constants and necessary model simplifications mean that accurate quantitative predictions are still lacking. Improving the level of accuracy will require a systematic experimental approach followed by model refinements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} cryogenic Y-joint {{testing at}} Langley Research Center (LaRC) {{to validate the}} performance of optical fiber Bragg grating strain sensors for measuring strain at liquid helium temperature (- 240 C). This testing also verified survivability of fiber sensors after experiencing 10 thermal cool-down, <b>warm-up</b> <b>cycles</b> and 400 limit load cycles. Graphite composite skins bonded to a honeycomb substrate in a sandwich configuration comprised the Y-joint specimens. To enable SHM of composite cryotanks for consideration to future spacecraft, a light-weight, durable monitoring technology is needed. The fiber optic distributed Bragg grating strain sensing system developed at LaRC is a viable substitute for conventional strain gauges which are not practical for SHM. This distributed sensing technology uses an Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR). This measurement approach has the advantage that it can measure hundreds of Bragg grating sensors per fiber and the sensors are all written at one frequency, greatly simplifying fiber manufacturing. Fiber optic strain measurements compared well to conventional strain gauge measurements obtained during these tests. These results demonstrated a high potential for a successful implementation of a SHM system incorporating LaRC's fiber optic sensing system on the composite cryotank and other future cryogenic applications...|$|R

GP- 5000 HT {{precision}} glass {{molding machine}} {{has been found}} to be a capable tool for bridging the gap between research-level instruments and the higher volume production machines typically used in industry, providing a means to apply the results of rigorous instrumentation analysis performed in the lab to industrial PGM applications. The GP- 5000 HT's thermal and mechanical functionality is explained and characterized through the measurement baseline functionality and the associated error. These baseline measurements were used to determine the center thickness repeatability of pressed glass parts, which is the main metric used in industrial pressing settings. The baselines and the repeatability tests both confirmed the need for three <b>warm-up</b> pressing <b>cycles</b> before the press reaches a thermal steady state. The baselines used for pressing a 2 mm glass piece to a 1 mm target center thickness yielded an average center thickness of 1. 001 mm and a standard deviation of thickness of 0. 0055 mm for glass samples pressed over 3 consecutive days. The baseline tests were then used to deconvolve the sources of error of final pressed piece center thickness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh {{precision}} manufacturers continuously {{seek out}} disruptive technologies {{to improve the}} quality, cost, and delivery of their products. With the advancement of machine tool and measurement technology many companies are ready to capitalise on the opportunity of on-machine measurement (OMM). Coupled with business case, manufacturing engineers are now questioning whether OMM can soon {{eliminate the need for}} post-process inspection systems. Metrologists will however argue that the machining environment is too hostile and that there are numerous process variables which need consideration before traceable measurement on-the-machine can be achieved. In this paper we test the measurement capability of five new multi-axis machine tools enabled as OMM systems via on-machine probing. All systems are tested under various operating conditions in order to better understand the effects of potentially significant variables. This investigation has found that key process variables such as machine tool <b>warm-up</b> and tool-change <b>cycles</b> can have an effect on machine tool measurement repeatability.

All the performances of the IT Nb 3 Sn strand is able tomeet the ITER specifications. In 2010, one hundred kilograms of IT Nb 3 Sn strand has been cabled, jacketed and integrated into conductor sample titled with TFCN 2 by ASIPP in China and tested in CRPP, Switzerland. After 1200 <b>cycles</b> <b>warm-up</b> and cooling down, Tcs of the TFCN 2 Sultan sample at 10. 78 T, 4. 5 K are 6. 35 K for the left leg and 6. 37 K for the right leg, respectively, which {{is larger than the}} ITER lower limit of 5. 7 K. This is the first successful Sultan sample made of Chinese Nb 3 Sn strand. In 2011, the influence of applied axial strain on critical current (Ic) was investigated using TFCN 2 strand in the University of Twente, the Netherland. The irreversible degradation of Ic starts around + 0. 23 % tensile intrinsic strain. The heat treatment influence of the duration at 650 o C on microstructure and performance was also studied. It was found that the fraction of un-reacted Nb after heat treatment is dependent on the position in the cross section.

The participant was then seated on the isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, New York, USA) at the previously recorded seat adjustments so that the femoral epicondyle was aligned with the dynamometer’s axis of rotation and the ankle strap positioned 5  cm proximal to the medial malleolus. Along with the ankle, straps were placed around the chest, the hips and the leg to be tested in order to isolate the quadriceps femoris muscle. The lower limb was weighed, with the knee fully extended, to account for the action of gravity. CON and ECC contractions were performed over a 60 ° range of motion (from ~ 110 ° knee flexion) and ISO tension measured at 75 °. The participant then performed five MVC of each type with each set separated by 2  min of passive recovery. CON and ECC torque was measured at an angular velocity of 30 ° s− 1. Peak and average peak torque for CON and ECC, and peak and average peak ISO tension (average calculated from the five contractions) were recorded.|$|R

This study {{examined}} the effects of single set dynamic and static stretching on vertical jump height and hip and knee range of motion in a sample of college age recreational males. Forty-two healthy, physically active males (aged 18 - 24) voluntarily participated in this investigation and were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups (1 set of 20 seconds dynamic stretch, 1 set of 20 second static stretch, or control). The knee and hip range of motion, sit and reach, and jump height were measured before and after the treatment condition. The same measures were performed on the control group that sat for 12 minutes. All subjects began with a five minute <b>warm-up</b> on a <b>cycle</b> ergometer. Following the warm-up period, subjects immediately began their stretching program. Results of the investigation showed significant changes from pre-to-post for all dependent measures (p < 0. 05). A significant difference between groups was found for sit and reach in the SS + DS groups (p < 0. 05). However, there were no significant differences between groups for jump height or knee and hip range of motion. The results of the present study suggest that static and dynamic stretching for 20 seconds prior to a vertical jump can improve vertical jump height and hip and knee range of motion in a sample of male college age recreational athletes. Future research is needed to investigate the effect of single set stretching exercise prior to activities requiring maximal force production that includes athletes and female subjects...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} clarify the acute effects of static {{stretching}} (SS) and cyclic stretching (CS) on muscle stiffness and hardness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) by using ultrasonography, range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint and ankle plantar flexor. Twenty healthy men participated in this study. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} SS, CS and control conditions. Each session consisted of a standard 5 -minute <b>cycle</b> <b>warm-up,</b> accompanied by one of the subsequent conditions in another day: (a) 2 minutes static stretching, (b) 2 minutes cyclic stretching, (c) control. Maximum ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM max) and normalized peak torque (NPT) of ankle plantar flexor were measured in the pre- and post-stretching. To assess muscle stiffness, muscle-tendon junction (MTJ) displacement (the length changes in tendon and muscle) and MTJ angle (the angle made by the tendon of insertion and muscle fascicle) of MG were measured using ultrasonography at an ankle dorsiflexion angle of − 10 °, 0 °, 10 ° and 20 ° before and after SS and CS for 2 minutes in the pre- and post-stretching. MG hardness was measured using ultrasound real-time tissue elastography (RTE). The results of this study indicate a significant effect of SS for ROM maximum, MTJ angle (0 °, 10 °, 20 °) and RTE (10 °, 20 °) compared with CS (p < 0. 05).
