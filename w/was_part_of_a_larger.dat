5|$|The {{issue of}} {{offering}} vocational training <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> challenge for Morgan {{in her first}} few years at the university. Because of the school's status as a land-grant university, the program was required to follow California State Department of Education directives to produce graduates trained as teachers, agricultural extension specialists and dietitians. However, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, {{president of the university}} in the early 20th century, saw those fields as vocations, and he encouraged Morgan to continue her focus on science.|$|E

NY18 was realigned in 1949 to follow its modern alignment between Lewiston and Lake Ontario, at which time its former routing alongside the Niagara River became NY18F.|$|E
5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices.

5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States {{as a result of an}} eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with {{the facts of the}} murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> plan to put Nashville {{in a position to}} contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1968 {{the group}} was again activated, this time in Vietnam. Its {{activation}} <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> activation of several military police groups {{in the region to}} provide greater command and control for Military Police operating throughout the region. As such, the headquarters element took command of military police units already operating in the country. The Brigade provided policing duties, based in Long Binh along with the 89th Military Police Group. During that time it was a subordinate unit of the 18th Military Police Brigade. It received its distinctive unit insignia on 12 November 1969. The group operated in Vietnam until the pullout of U.S. forces from the nation, receiving ten campaign streamers for its role in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, {{advanced}} to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended {{by a group}} of South Korean police, as no military was available due to manpower shortages. The Koreans, members of the NK 6th Division, set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout parties to the east. The move <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then Masan, in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit. Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible.|$|E
