The following month, it was reported that he was also beginning work on a comedy film about a family of WWE fighters, titled Fighting <b>with</b> <b>My</b> <b>Family.</b> In April 2017, Johnson's upcoming production schedule {{was announced}} that filming for Rampage had begun, and that Jungle Cruise will begin filming in early 2018. Johnson's role within the movie will also extend to the themepark ride, as Disney is reportedly in the process of redesigning it, with Johnson's input as well. The new layout will feature at all Walt Disney Parks and Resorts locations worldwide. That same month, the first spin-off to The Fast and the Furious franchise was reported to feature Johnson and Jason Statham's characters teaming up for a mission with franchise screenwriter Chris Morgan signed on to write the script. Several months later in July, it was revealed that Johnson will not appear in Shazam, but will remain attached as producer for the film.

Although I was honest in every painful detail <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>family,</b> I did not tell the public.

25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>family?</b> What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I studied the whole business of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired."

500|$|... 2001 {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} year for Gugelmin. During the practice session for the race at Texas Motor Speedway, he crashed after he lost control in the second turn and hit the wall with a force of 66.2g, before a second impact with the wall which exerted a force of 113.1g. The event was eventually called off after drivers complained of dizziness, nausea and blurred vision, which were caused by the high g-forces experienced when driving at speed on the track. During the week before the race at Nazareth Speedway, Gugelmin's son, Giuliano, died from respiratory complications. Giuliano was quadriplegic and a lifelong sufferer from cerebral palsy owing to complications at birth. The PacWest team announced that Gugelmin would not be taking part in the race. Gugelmin's team mate at PacWest, Scott Dixon, won the race beating Kenny Bräck into second place. At the end of 2001, Gugelmin decided to retire from the sport, stating [...] "I definitely want to spend more time <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> After those two big accidents, and Alex 's deal in Germany, I said, 'That's it.

It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also no mistaking that we love each other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna is in control, but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance."
