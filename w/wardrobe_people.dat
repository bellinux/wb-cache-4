50|$|The {{concept of}} this Musterhaus release is {{providing}} {{a series of}} samples of cassette recordings that Einstürzende Neubauten has amassed over the years. As noted {{on the back of}} the album, in their earlier years every member of the band owned a cassette recorder and found it invaluable. Recorded were various audio experiments with friends, general field recordings of found sounds (such as the dismantling of a <b>wardrobe,</b> <b>people</b> entering a shop, expeditions to certain areas, etc.), tape noise experiments, answering machine recordings and nearly every interview they conducted during that time period.|$|E
50|$|Hillary got {{the girls}} {{together}} {{to go through}} their schedule for the promotional tour of New Zealand and Australia, but Sarah was absent, having been to the hospital because of illness. However, {{when it came time}} to fly, Sarah was better and with the girls. Landing in New Zealand and recovering from the long flight, it was time for the first part of promotion. Polydor hired some local hair stylists and <b>wardrobe</b> <b>people</b> to style the girls for what they thought was a radio interview, but the staff turned up late. When they arrived, they ended up styling Nadine, Nicola and Sarah from the official wardrobe, with Cheryl having already gotten dressed in her own clothes (Kimberley had fallen ill). This led to a massive argument between Cheryl and the head stylist over the delay and the changed plans, which now included the girls going on TV instead of on the radio, with Cheryl fearing that she'd look out of place not dressed in wardrobe. This led to their first day of promotion running late.|$|E

5000|$|It was his {{emotional}} withdrawal from his father, according to MacLaine, {{that made her}} brother {{want to become a}} filmmaker, sometimes writing, producing, directing and starring in his films: [...] "That's why he's more comfortable behind the camera," [...] she says. [...] "He's in the total-control aspect. He has to have control over everything. Beatty doesn't deny that need; in speaking about his earliest parts, he said [...] "When I acted in films I used to come with suggestions about the script, the lighting, the <b>wardrobe,</b> and <b>people</b> used to say 'Waddya want, to produce the picture as well?' And I used to say that I supposed I did." ...|$|R
50|$|Fetish {{fashion is}} any style or {{appearance}} {{in the form of}} atype of clothing or accessory, created to be extreme or provocative. These styles are not usually worn by the majority of people on any regular basis. They are usually made of materials such as leather, latex or synthetic rubber or plastic, nylon, PVC, spandex, fishnet, and stainless steel. Some fetish fashion items include: stiletto heel shoes and boots (most notably the ballet boot), hobble skirts, corsets, collars, full-body latex catsuits, stockings, miniskirt, crotchless underwear, garters, locks, rings, zippers, eyewear, handcuffs, and stylized costumes based on more traditional outfits, such as wedding dresses that are almost completely see-through lace. Fetish fashions are sometimes confused with costuming, because both are usually understood to be clothing that is not worn as the usual <b>wardrobe</b> of <b>people,</b> and are instead worn to create a particular reaction.|$|R

For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear." [...] A response to that was [...] "I disagree. No khakis." [...] She states that [...] "there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual <b>wardrobe.</b> All most <b>people</b> know is they don’t want to see {{too much of a}} colleague’s body, including feet." ...|$|R
50|$|Even walking posed problems, as {{shoes were}} rationed. However, anyone could {{get hold of}} shoes with wooden soles without using a ration ticket. These were uncomfortable, fragile and {{certainly}} not waterproof. A shortage of fabrics made prices soar. Clothes were patched up. Knitting was unpicked to reknit other garments. A red sweater became two or three pairs of long red socks. Reduced <b>wardrobes</b> meant <b>people</b> rarely changed clothes, but those aspiring to elegance painted false stockings on their legs with liquid chicory. Washing clothes was not easy. Washing powder was eventually replaced by ashes or by using infusions of plants such as soapwort, which lathers like soap. Ivy was used for black garments, worn by the numerous women in mourning. The tubes taken from redundant bicycle pumps were used as moulds for the manufacture of candles made with lard, the wicks made from cotton, which itself was recycled from old hand-crocheted curtains.|$|R

500|$|The {{performance}} gained widespread {{attention from}} the media after M.I.A. extended her middle finger to the camera {{near the end of}} her verse instead of singing the word [...] "shit". Media criticized M.I.A. for the gesture and compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 <b>wardrobe</b> malfunction. <b>People</b> said, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do during the show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans." [...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage. [...] The league later fined the rapper a total of $16.6 million as penalty, which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Basil, Manuel, and Polly {{are then}} {{burdened}} {{with the task}} of trying to move the body from the room without the guests seeing. However, while moving him across the upstairs hall, Miss Tibbs sees the body and gets hysterical, so on Basil's advice Polly slaps her, but rather too hard and in fact knocks her out. The unconscious Miss Tibbs and the deceased are hidden in a bedroom cupboard. The room's occupants Mr. and Mrs. White want to enter their room there and then, so Basil, Polly, and Manuel have to create a distraction, but Mr. and Mrs. White still hear Miss Tibbs moaning in the cupboard and force Basil to let her out. Whilst Basil tells them that she is a mad woman who likes to hide in <b>people's</b> <b>wardrobes,</b> Polly notices that Leeman's arm is sticking out of the cupboard and desperately tries to signal this to Basil, only resulting in more confusion.|$|R
40|$|In this PhD thesis, The Daily Selection, I will be {{addressing}} the overall {{question of how}} research on wardrobes can contribute to a more effective connection between the production and the consumption of dress objects. The thesis builds on exemplary studies of <b>people</b> in their <b>wardrobes,</b> {{with the aim of}} focusing on theoretical and methodological concerns and implications. It is structured in three parts, each of which consists -­‐ independently -­‐ of its own introductory framing, its own literature review, its own methods chapter, its own field work study, and its own conclusive reflections. As such, the parts, when taken as a whole, represent an evolving process through which my overall research questions are being filtered and reflected. My scholarly approach builds on the fusing of fashion and dress research and design research, in this way closing a gap between dress practice as, on the one hand, symbolic discourse and, on the other, as an embodied practice that is 'physically embedded' in the material capacities of dress objects. In Part I, I frame this view by {{addressing the}} concept of dressing as a 'bodily situated practice', as defined by Entwistle (2000), combined with a processual view on design and everyday practices, as defined by Shove et al. (2008). Based on these perspectives, I contribute with my own explanatory frameworks of 'sartorial systems' and 'sensory anchoring', on which I base the entire thesis. In order to operationalise these frameworks in my field work, I have developed a personal methodology for the wardrobe method that embraces the sensory and temporal aspects of dress practice. In Part II, I filter this through the vehicle of a collaborative project with Danish designer Mads Nørgaard, wherein I observe how dress objects from Nørgaard's collection are appropriated and used in the wardrobes of informants. In this way, I point to discrepancies between the production and the dissemination of dress objects that take place in the fashion industry, and to the ways that people use and experience these objects in their everyday lives. In Part III, I conduct a series of ‘wardrobe sessions’ with informants in collaboration with a designer, in order to explore how use practice might cast reflections back onto design processes. In my concluding chapter, I argue that my thesis contributes with a more facetted and reflected set of thinking in relation to dress practice, and that this way of thinking could potentially bring about radical changes in the way dress objects are currently produced, disseminated and sold. All together, this thesis shows that in order to establish a more tight fit between the production and consumption of dress objects, there is very good reason to look into the dress practices that are taking place in <b>people’s</b> <b>wardrobes...</b>|$|R
