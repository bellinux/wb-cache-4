Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying <b>duct</b> insulation level, <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> area, return <b>duct</b> area, <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> leakage, return duct leakage, and ceiling insulation levels. The results of sensitivity analyses show acceptable agreement versus the EnergyGauge program for <b>duct</b> insulation level, <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> area, return <b>duct</b> area, <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> leakage, and ceiling insulation level.

40|$|In {{ventilation}} systems, disturbing whistlings {{can occur}} at outlets. This whistling phenomenon {{belongs to the}} self-sustained tones class which can be produced when a low velocity flow impinges on a downstream obstacle. The coupling of the tones with acoustic resonances (so-called indirect feedback path) can promote high-level harmonic noises. This experimental study deals with the coupling of a jet-slot oscillator, modelling a ventilation outlet, with the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> resonances. The flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> is damped by using various amounts of acoustic damping foam, {{and the effect of}} this damping on the sound production is studied. It is shown that for a jet exit/obstacle distance higher than 2. 5 jet height (L/H> 2. 5), the tone’s frequency matches satisfactorily with frequencies predicted by a model describing favourable phase relationships for the occurrence of tones along the feedback loop. When the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> is resonant, it is noticeable that the tone’s frequency occurs at a duct resonance frequency which is close to the frequency described by this model. For lower values of L/H (slot closer to the jet exit), a better knowledge of the convection velocity behaviour along the vortices path could improve the tone’s frequency prediction. The use of damping foam within the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> prevents the occurrence of the tones’ coupling with a duct resonance, especially with high amounts of damping material, and dramatically reduces the emitted acoustic levels. For moderate amounts of damping material, the suppression of coupling occurs only for higher flow speeds, as the tone’s frequencies are higher and the damping material is then more efficient...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{between a}} subsonic jet-slot oscillator (usually {{referred to as}} a slot-tone) and acoustical resonances of the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> is investigated experimentally. The aspect ratio of the jet height H to the slot stand-off distance L is varied in the range 0 Rep 2. 10 ^ 4. The acoustical pressure measured {{at the back of the}} slot-plate at a distance of 75 mm from the slot edge reaches whistling values to the order 10 2 of the stagnation pressure (or 115 dB SPL). Two types of oscillation behavior have been observed depending mainly on Re. For lower Re values, a hydrodynamic oscillator (edge-tone like) is generated, while for Re> 104, the oscillator is coupled to the resonances of the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct.</b> This resonant duct creates an indirect feedback path (organ-pipe like) that controls the tone frequency and reinforces their amplitude. An important result is that this lock-in phenomenon involves very high-order nonplanar acoustical modes (up to the 32 nd). The introduction of damping foam in the flow <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> induces a decrease of the emitted levels reaching 25 dB for the emitted levels, but the oscillation behavior remains dependent on the duct resonance. This indicates that purely hydrodynamical behavior cannot be studied without a special design of the flow supply. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{equations}} {{were developed}} {{and applied to}} predict losses of 0. 01 - 100 {micro}m airborne particles making a single pass through 120 different ventilation duct runs typical of those found in mid-sized office buildings. For all duct runs, losses were negligible for submicron particles and nearly complete for particles larger than 50 {micro}m. The 50 th percentile cut-point diameters were 15 {micro}m in supply runs and 25 {micro}m in return runs. Losses in <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> runs were higher than in return duct runs, mostly because internal insulation was present in portions of <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> runs, but absent from return duct runs. Single-pass equations for particle loss in duct runs were combined with models for predicting ventilation system filtration efficiency and particle deposition to indoor surfaces to evaluate the fates of particles of indoor and outdoor origin in an archetypal mechanically ventilated building. Results suggest that duct losses are a minor influence for determining indoor concentrations for most particle sizes. Losses in ducts were of a comparable magnitude to indoor surface losses for most particle sizes. For outdoor air drawn into an unfiltered ventilation system, most particles smaller than 1 {micro}m are exhausted from the building.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} HVAC energy use in large commercial buildings {{is due to}} fan operation. Fan energy use depends {{in part on the}} relationship between system pressure drop and flow through the fan, which is commonly called a "system curve". As a step toward enabling better selections of air-handling system components and analyses of common energy efficiency measures such as duct static pressure reset and duct leakage sealing, this paper shows that a simple four-parameter physical model can be used to define system curves. Our model depends on the square of the fan flow, as is commonly considered. It also includes terms that account for linear-like flow resistances such as filters and coils, and for <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> leakage when damper positions are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. Only two parameters are needed for systems with variable-position supply dampers (e. g., VAV box dampers modulating to control flow). For these systems, reducing or eliminating <b>supply</b> <b>duct</b> leakage does not change the system curve. The parametric system curve may be most useful when applied to field data. Non-linear techniques could be used to fit the curve to fan pressure rise and flow measurements over a range of operating conditions.
