25|$|On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe {{denied that}} {{negotiations}} ever took place {{and nothing was}} ever agreed on. Ellerbe stated: Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself {{speak to each other}} on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you little}} sly puss! <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> girl who {{never thought of}} the matter? I think that a young man of six-and-twenty ought to be married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I wasn't. But I ain't. You {{might as}} well let that {{accident}} pass, sans dire. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> moment in which you thought that I should earn my bread?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the better," [...] replied Tommy, cheerily. [...] "Make {{yourself}} at home, Elspeth; he's the kind I can manage. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>a</b> kind I couldna manage?" [...] he whispered, top-heavy with conceit.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Was there ever,' cried Mr Tigg, {{joining the}} young men at the door, and {{shutting}} it carefully behind him, 'such an independent spirit as is possessed by that extraordinary creature?

5000|$|Nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> <b>an</b> {{instance}} of wars being carried on in an enemy's country with less {{injury to the}} assailants than at this; for in so great a defeat, and in a battle which continued four hours, only one man died, and he, not from wounds inflicted by hostile weapons, or any honorable means, but, having fallen from his horse, was trampled to death. Combatants then engaged with little danger; being nearly all mounted, covered with armor, and preserved from death whenever they chose to surrender, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no necessity for risking their lives; while fighting, their armor defended them, and when they could resist no longer, they yielded and were safe.|$|R
