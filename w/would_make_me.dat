She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted {{for six years}} and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated [...] "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to," [...] and {{that she is a}} [...] "private" [...] actress. In 2009, she commented, [...] "People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better." [...] Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist Dave Navarro {{and were}} on the verge of {{breaking}} up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> happier in the world." [...] With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, Californication, released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music, which affected the band's recording style during the album. Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on Californication was his favorite.|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

5000|$|Rig Vedic {{society was}} {{relatively}} egalitarian {{in the sense}} that a distinct hierarchy of socio-economic classes or castes was absent. However, political hierarchy was determined by rank, where rajan stood at the top and dasi at the bottom. The words Brahamana and Kshatriya occur in various family books of the Rig Veda, but they are not associated with the term varna. The words Vaishya and Shudra are absent. Verses of the Rig Veda, such as 3.44-45, indicate the absence of strict social hierarchy and the existence of social mobility: O, Indra, fond of soma, <b>would</b> you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> the protector of people, or <b>would</b> you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> a king, <b>would</b> you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> a sage who has drunk soma, would you impart to me endless wealth.|$|R

500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels good about it and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

2500|$|Okajima has a {{distinctive}} pitching {{form in which}} he turns his head downwards just before he releases the ball and after release jerks it hard towards third base. These extra movements appear to give Okajima some added velocity to his pitches as they torque his body towards home plate and reportedly disguise his pitches and cause batters to swing early. Okajima {{is said to have}} mimicked the pitching form of a pitcher in Yoichi Takahashi's manga [...] who torqued his head so much after every pitch that his hat came flying off. Okajima admits, [...] "I was trying to copy the motion. I believed it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> throw harder." ...|$|E

After {{a trip to}} Hawaii during which Amos learned about legendary volcano goddess Pele, the album began taking shape; Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her {{life as well as}} a journey to finding her own fire as a woman. From there, Amos explained, the songs just came. [...] "Sometimes the fury of it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> step back, I began to live these songs as we separated. The vampire in me came out.

He believed they were mostly Freudians and would trace most of his problems to sexual maladjustments, so he depicts his discomfort as nakedness in this panel. Above the half-naked subject in the test tube is a snake, functioning as a catalyst to reveal more about the subject. Kurelek writes, [...] "In this case the doctor might introduce some extremely unpleasant idea at the conference that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> squirm with embarrassment.” ...|$|E

2500|$|While the {{insanity}} explanation {{was not uncommon}} during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (The House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered {{by some to be}} remarkably coherent. [...] Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a [...] "kind and warm-hearted man", [...] "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking [...] "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences", with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a [...] "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar".
