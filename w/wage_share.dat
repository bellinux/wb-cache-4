A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‘Declines in the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> {{have been attributed to}} the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} {{narratives}} connecting {{the financial crisis}} - {{as well as the}} Great Depression of the 1930 s - with the functional or personal income distribution and its pre-crisis movements. The paper investigates whether this claim can be supported with evidence showing that the crisis was deeper in countries in which incomes were more polarized or where <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> were lower. Empirical evidence for 37 mainly industrialized countries does not generally support the hypothesis that either the level of or the change in distribution was closely linked to the performance of a country during the crisis. Some evidence shows a tentatively improved performance if <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> as well as polarization decreased. Declining <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> could have increased the resilience of firms in the crisis; the lower income differences may have bolstered consumption of domestic goods.

50|$|The term Bowley's Law {{was first}} used by Paul Samuelson in 1964 in the 6th American edition of his classic {{textbook}} Economics as {{a name for the}} stylized fact of a constant <b>wage</b> <b>share.</b> Thereby, Samuelson meant to honor the economist Arthur Bowley, who pioneered the collection and statistical analysis of wage data in the UK. Having already speculated in 1920 that the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> might be constant and having found (together with Josiah Stamp) evidence for his speculation in a comparison between the UK's wage shares in 1911 and 1924, Bowley became the first to clearly assert the constancy of the <b>wage</b> <b>share</b> in his 1937 book Wages and Income in the United Kingdom since 1860. This finding was remarkably at odds with the teachings of classical economists like Ricardo who perceived the factor shares of land, capital, and labor to be inherently flexible.|$|E
40|$|The {{incomes of}} workers and capitalists pertain to {{different}} moments of accumulation. <b>Wages</b> are <b>shares</b> of capital outlays sustaining production; profits are shares of commodity sales. If aggregate demand and the scale of productive undertakings are shaped {{with a measure of}} mutual autonomy, the class distribution of income and the measure of economic activity are jointly determined by the same processes. In those settings “wage-led growth ” has neither analytical nor policy purchase as associations between <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> and levels of output (or growth) are confounded consequences of distinct effects on each measure of broader developments in the economy. A more appropriate dichotomy is that between “investment-led” and “consumption-led ” growth, with the former resulting in comparatively higher <b>wage</b> <b>shares.</b> After advancing and illustrating these points, this paper motivates its approach to class income flows and the role of demand [...] which draw on the Circuit of Capital [...] in relation to the equivalent Kaleckian approaches sustaining arguments for “wage-led growth”...|$|R

Nonetheless, the lack of demand during recessions causes a fall in the price of raw materials, so the [...] parameter goes down.

40|$|The {{historical}} role of European {{farming in}} southern and central Africa {{is a delicate}} matter that has received {{a great deal of}} attention among scholars over the years. Going through this vast literature a striking consensus emerges: success or failure of European farming in southern Africa was to a large extent depending on their access and control over labour. These propositions have so far never been systematically and empirically tested. This paper is an attempt to do that by analyzing the ‘wage-burden’ European settler farmers faced. The wage-burden is identified by measuring <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> (total amount paid in the form of <b>wages</b> as a <b>share</b> of total profits) on European farms in colonial Africa. Based on archival documents we construct time-series for value of output, transportation costs, investments and <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> for European tobacco and tea farms in colonial Malawi. Our estimates show that the wage burden decreased significantly after 1930 s, i. e. the European farmers were able to capture a larger part of the rent over time. We argue that the developments cannot be explained by domestic colonial policies, but changes in regional migration patterns, which had a significant impact on the supply of farm labour...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} been {{characterized}} by rapid technological change. In the same period, early withdrawal from the labor market has increased markedly. One particular question concerns the effects of technological change and organizational change on the labor market participation of workers of different ages. The question posed in this paper is whether technological change and organizational change are biased against age, thereby causing a shift in demand from older to younger workers. We estimate the effects of organizational change and technological change on <b>wage</b> bill <b>shares</b> for five age groups. By using panel data, we control for unobserved firm fixed effects. The results indicate that organizational change raises the <b>wage</b> bill <b>share</b> for workers in their forties but lowers the share for workers in their fifties. The <b>wage</b> bill <b>shares</b> of the youngest and oldest workers are hardly affected by organizational change and technological change. Separate estimates {{for men and women}} yield qualitatively similar results. In regressions for different educational levels, <b>wage</b> bill <b>shares</b> are positively affected by organizational change for highly educated individuals in their thirties.

The smaller firms using non-base wages, on the other hand, dedicate a larger share of total pay to this wage component (12 %, compared to about 9 % in firms of other sizes). The use of non-base wage components is also quite sector-specific. More than 92 % of firms in financial intermediation sector use it and pay higher non-base <b>wage</b> <b>shares</b> compared to other sectors. At the other extreme, only 60 % of firms in the construction sector pay a part of their wages as non-base wage components.

We find that that women’s relative wage remained stable while employment increased, leading to an increase in women’s <b>wage</b> bill <b>share.</b> Between-industry shifts, consistent with trade-based explanations, account for up to 40 percent of the growth in women’s <b>wage</b> bill <b>share</b> between 1990 and 2000. Comparing across industries, we find tariff cuts and exports are positively related to industry growth and women benefited since some of the fastest growing industries were female-intensive industries. We use establishment level data for the manufacturing sector to examine within-industry shifts in women’s <b>wage</b> bill <b>share.</b> Even controlling for detailed industry and maquiladora status, women’s <b>wage</b> bill <b>share</b> is positively related to exports by foreign firms, suggesting that trade liberalization further encouraged outsourcing and assembly-type activity.
