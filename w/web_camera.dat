2500|$|The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation {{observation}} outposts at Mount Merapi began observing at 00:00 {{and concluded}} at 06:00 and reported no significant visible activity. Merapi spewed hot {{clouds in the}} afternoon. Sulfatara smoke was visible from several posts and avalanches were observed. Mount Merapi erupted at 10:10 local time Monday morning spewing hot clouds and dark fog masses in easterly direction punctuated by loud explosions. Lt Col Soekoso Wahyudi, chief of the Boyolali district military command, was reported by Antara news as saying the explosions this time were louder than those of Sunday evening 31 October. The hot clouds descended on part of the mountain slopes and moved in easterly direction. Local military and police commands deployed personnel on roads in areas around the mountain to regulate traffic which had become clogged by vehicles and people rushing to leave the danger zones. Reports from Klaten, Sleman and Boyolali districts suggested the volcanic explosions were so loud they caused panic and a rush to seek refuge.

An uninterrupted stream of smoke clouds were sent into the air for 40 minutes, heading southward toward a nearby river in Sleman regency, and took with it an estimated 2million cubic metres of rock and earth from the peak.

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>cameras</b> are {{becoming}} more and more common on the Internet, and the technology is ready to make cameras a standard accessory of any computer. The development of applications, however, hasn't followed the explosive di#usion of the cameras. Problems in developing applications for remote <b>web</b> <b>cameras</b> come from the low image quality that they generally provide and from the fact that, unless the application runs locally, the image data are only available at a very low frame rate (typically between 10 sec/image and 30 min/image).
