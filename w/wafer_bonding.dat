40|$|Fast atom beam {{activated}} direct <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds</b> {{can be used}} {{to combine}} GaAs and Si semiconductor structures and to achieve high bond strength and optical transparency. Some applications require a low ohmic resistance between the materials. Therefore, IV-characteristics of n-type <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds</b> between n-Si and n-GaAs were thoroughly investigated. n-Si/n-Si bonds showed ohmic resistance below 2. 5 × 10 − 3 cm 2. However diode like IV-curves were found for both n-GaAs/n-GaAs and n-Si/n-GaAs bonds. This {{can be explained by the}} formation of a potential barrier at the interface, caused by carrier trapping in fast atom beam induced defects. Hall measurements of n-GaAs after fast atom beam treatment confirmed both, a reduction of the active carrier concentration, and the electron mobility. It was found that thermal annealing and higher bond temperatures can help reducing the potential barrier height at the n-Si/n-GaAs interface and thus lower the electrical bond resistance by healing crystalline defects. Highly conductive n-Si/n-GaAs <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds</b> with an interface resistance below 3. 6 × 10 − 3 cm 2 were achieved after the optimization. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|MicrochanneIs {{were created}} by fusion bonding of a Pyrex cover to a {{thermally}} oxidized silicon wafer, which contained anisotropically etched grooves. Such channels are frequently used in microfluidic handling systems, for example, in chemical analysis. Since {{in some of these}} labs-on-a-chip, in particular those used in liquid chromatography, the channels are subjected to high pressures of up to a few hundred bar, {{it is important to have}} information about the mechanical stability of the channel chip, in particular of the <b>wafer</b> <b>bond</b> involved in it. The latter is the subject of this paper. The maximum pressure that can be applied to several different channel chips was investigated experimentally. In order to find the relation among this maximum pressure, channel geometry, materials elasticity, and bond energy, an energy model was developed that is generally applicable to all types of <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds.</b> It was shown that the model is substantiated by the experimental pressure data, from which it could be calculated that the effective bond energy increased from 0. 018 to 0. 19 J/m 2 for an annealing temperature ranging from 310 to 470 °...|$|R
40|$|Bonding {{techniques}} {{intended for}} assembling space microsystems are studied in this work. One {{of the largest}} problems in <b>bonding</b> pre-processed semiconductor <b>wafers</b> are the severe process restrictions imposed by material compatibility issues. Plasma processes have shown {{to be good for}} sensitive materials integration why the influence of different plasma parameters on the bondability of wafers is particularly studied. Conventional wet chemical and field-assisted methods are also examined. The resulting bond quality is assessed in terms of mechanical strength, homogeneity, and yield. The effect of spaceflight environment on the reliability of <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds</b> is also investigated. Both high and low temperature annealed bonds are found to be very robust. Effects observed are that low temperature bonds are reinforced by thermal cycling in vacuum and that high temperature bonds degrade slightly by low dose γ irradiation. Adhesion quantification is important for all bonding. Development of accurate quantification methods is considered necessary since most methods at hand are limited. This work includes the development of the blister test method. Former test structures are improved to be more practical to work with and to yield low experimental scatter. A physical stress model for the improved structure is suggested with which successful predictions of fracture for different test specimen configurations are made. The blister test method is used throughout this work to assess the strength of <b>wafer</b> <b>bonds.</b> The physics background and modelling of other common test methods are also thoroughly analysed. The methods’ practical capabilities and limitations are commented; origin and mitigation of measurement errors are discussed.
