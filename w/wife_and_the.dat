The Jain version, the Vasudevahindi of Samghadasa Gani, says Trijata is a sister of Ravana, Vibhishana, Kumbhakarna, and Shurpanakha. Jayamangala's commentary on the Bhattikavya also describes Trijata as Ravana's sister.|$|E

5|$|Kasche further {{stated that}} it would be useful from a {{military}} perspective if the Partisans were allowed to fight the Chetniks without German interference, and counselled against trying to fight the Partisans and the Chetniks at the same time.

In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E

During World War I, Sydney Coggins served with, and was commissioned by the regiment. After the war, he was appointed regimental Riding Master, but he was retired when the 1st and 2nd Life Guards were amalgamated into a single regiment under the Geddes Axe.

5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> idea of an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga {{fell in love with}} George, but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E

5|$|In 1760, {{with the}} Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by {{advancing}} Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid {{compensation for the}} damage caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles – an exorbitant amount at the time. The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.|$|E
5|$|Pulsford {{continued}} {{his support for}} the free-trade cause outside Parliament, and in May 1914 planned to establish a free-trade paper to be circulated around Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, a scheme that was abandoned following the outbreak of World War I. He revised his book Commerce and the Empire (originally published in 1903) in 1917, arguing that free trade was central to the freedoms the Empire was fighting for, and calling for free trade with Germany after the war. On 2 March 1919 he married Blanche Elspeth Brown at Neutral Bay, but he died later that year on his seventy-fifth birthday, 29 September 1919. Survived by his second <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three sons of his first marriage, Pulsford was buried at Gore Hill cemetery after an Anglican service.|$|E
5|$|The {{pyramid of}} the queen was first {{recognized}} in 1928 by C. M. Firth following his first excavations {{to the south of}} Userkaf's main pyramid. One year later in 1929, he proposed that the pyramid be assigned to Queen Neferhetepes, Userkaf's <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mother of Sahure. It was not before 1943 that Bernard Grdseloff discovered the tomb of Persen, a priest at the court of Userkaf and Neferhetepes. His tomb is located in the immediate vicinity of Userkaf's complex and yielded an inscribed stone giving the name and rank {{of the queen}}. This stone is now on display at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Further evidence confirming the assignment of the pyramid to Neferhetepes was discovered by Audran Labrousse in 1979 when he excavated the ruins of the temple. Consequently, the small pyramid complex has been attributed to her.|$|E

Finally, he noted that, as king of Dahomey, he had an obligation to distribute cowry shells and other common goods periodically among the common people.
