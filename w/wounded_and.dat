5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 24 captured on the 5th; 70 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 15 captured on the 6th; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E
5|$|Soult lost six field {{guns and}} 3,985 men {{including}} 542 killed, 2,077 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 1,366 prisoners. Foy and brigadiers Étienne de Barbot and Nicolas Gruardet were wounded. General of Brigade Jean-Pierre Béchaud of Taupin's division was killed. The Allies sustained losses of 367 killed, 1,727 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 80 captured {{for a total}} of 2,174. Of these, Portuguese casualties numbered 156 killed, 354 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 19 captured, while British losses were 211 killed, 1,373 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 61 captured. In addition to battle casualties, many of the recently conscripted French soldiers promptly deserted. Soult did not attempt to defend the Luy de Béarn with his demoralized army. Instead he retreated north to Saint-Sever on the Adour.|$|E
5|$|The 35th Infantry {{suffered}} 154 killed, 381 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> two missing {{during the}} battle. The 27th Infantry lost {{a total of}} 118 killed, 382 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> one captured during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, however this included five killed and 54 wounded at the Battle of the Bowling Alley and around 150 casualties at the First Battle of Naktong Bulge. In support of the Nam River operations, the 64th Field Artillery Battalion suffered 16 killed, 27 wounded, one captured and five missing, the 159th Field Artillery Battalion lost 18 killed and 41 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> the 90th Field Artillery Battalion 15 killed, 54 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> one missing. The regiment had performed so well in repulsing the North Koreans that Kean nominated it for a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{casualties}} vary enormously, {{but of the}} around 480,000 Allied troops involved in the campaign, 180,000 were <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> 44,000 died, 20,000 of the dead being British.|$|E
5|$|General Abercrombie {{reported}} 547 killed, 1,356 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 77 missing.

Chartrand estimates the number of British killed (or died of their wounds) at about 1,000 for the main battle, with about 1,500 wounded. The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> the loss of General Howe.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} neuro-immuno-modulation on wound healing by observing changes of cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones in acute stress reaction in rats with <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> combined local radiation injury. Methods: Sixty female Wistar rats (weighting 200 Â Â±Â  20 Â g) were randomly divided into normal control group, <b>wound</b> group <b>and</b> combined wound-local radiation (CWR) group (25 Â Gy local radiation post wound), 20 rats in each group. Contents of IL- 1 Î², IL- 6 and IFN-Î³ and IL- 4 in serum were measured and changes of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and glucocorticoid (GC) in serum {{were analyzed by}} using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunologic assay, respectively at different time points post <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation. Results: (1) The level of IFN-Î³, one of the Th 1 cell cytokines increased significantly at 14 Â d post CWR, which was markedly higher than that in control group <b>and</b> <b>wound</b> group. However, the level of IL- 4, IL- 1 Î² and IL- 6, one of the Th 2 cell cytokines, did not show obvious change. (2) Ratio of Th 1 /Th 2 (IFN-Î³/IL- 4) in <b>wound</b> group <b>and</b> CWR group increased significantly at 7 Â d after <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation, which suggested that Th 1 /Th 2 balance drifted to Th 1 immune response. The ratio of Th 1 /Th 2 in wound group returned to the normal level up to 14 Â d after the <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation, while the Th 1 /Th 2 ratio in CWR group increased persistently and was much higher than that in control <b>and</b> <b>wound</b> groups. (3) Level of serous ACTH and GC in CWR group increased at 3 Â d post <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation, and among them, level of GC showed statistically significant increase, which was much higher than that in control <b>and</b> <b>wound</b> groups. Conclusion: Level of serous neurohormone GC in rats increased significantly immediately after <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation; while the level of IFN-Î³ showed significant increase only up to 14 Â d after <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation, and the Th 1 /Th 2 imbalance sustained till 28 Â d post <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> radiation. In order to reduce acute damage caused by CWR, organic immune system and nerve system showed up a marked regulate effects simultaneously and mutually. Nonetheless, the excessive stress induced by CWR causes disturbance of immunoregulation, {{which is one of}} the key reasons for delayed wound healing in CWR.

30|$|Use {{of natural}} {{polymers}} is prevalent in medicine, for <b>wound</b> <b>and</b> burn dressings, because of biocompatibility, biodegradability and similarity to ECM.

5|$|Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> Blücher some 7,000 (810 {{of which}} were {{suffered}} by just one unit: the 18th Regiment, which served in Bülow's 15th Brigade, had fought at both Frichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33 Iron Crosses). Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.|$|E
5|$|While the Union {{lost about}} 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate {{casualty}} rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 <b>wounded</b> <b>and</b> captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses {{are estimated to}} be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> 80 captured). Wilcox's brigade reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were <b>wounded,</b> <b>and</b> a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.|$|E
40|$|Fibrinogen enters <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> solid tumors, {{where it}} is clotted to fibrin that may {{subsequently}} be replaced by collagenous stroma. If, as has been suggested, the pathogenesis of <b>wound</b> healing <b>and</b> tumor stroma generation is similar and dependent on fibrin deposition, then the types and amounts of fibrin deposited in <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> tumors might also {{be expected to be}} similar. To test this hypothesis, the authors injected homologous tracer fibrinogen (125 I-GPF) intravenously into guinea pigs and measured its influx and accumulation in skin <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> syngeneic carcinomas. In support of their hypothesis, the urea-insoluble product deposited in both <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> tumors was identified as cross-linked fibrin by gel electrophoresis. Accumulation of both total and urea-insoluble 125 I-GPF was quantitatively similar in <b>wounds</b> <b>and</b> tumors. However, influx and initial clotting of 125 I-GPF in tumors exceeded that in wounds; given equivalent accumulation, these data suggest that fibrin turnover is more rapid in tumors than in <b>wounds.</b> Fibrinogen influx <b>and</b> fibrin accumulation declined toward normal a few days after wounding but remained consistently elevated in tumors. Thus, the magnitude and the persistence of microvascular hyperpermeability, as well as fibrin turnover, are major points of difference that distinguish tumors from healing wounds...|$|R
