5|$|The {{agricultural}} {{sector of the}} English economy, still by far the largest, was transformed by the Black Death. With the shortage of manpower after the Black Death, wages for agricultural labourers rapidly increased and continued to then grow steadily throughout the 15th century. As their incomes increased, labourers' living conditions and diet improved steadily. A trend for labourers to eat less barley and more wheat and rye, and to replace bread in their diet with more meat, had been apparent since before the Black Death, but intensified during this later period. Nonetheless, England's much smaller population needed less food {{and the demand for}} agricultural products fell. The position of the larger landowners became increasingly difficult. Revenues from demesne lands were diminishing as demand remained low and <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> increased; nobles were also finding it more difficult to raise revenue from their local courts, fines and privileges in the years after the Peasants Revolt of 1381. Despite attempts to increase money rents, {{by the end of the}} 14th century the rents paid from peasant lands were also declining, with revenues falling as much as 55% between the 1380s and 1420s.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the profits}} came {{as a result of}} the company acting as a carrier, rather than from tolls. In {{addition}} to running narrow boats on the canals, they had a thriving business carrying goods across the River Mersey, between Liverpool, Ellesmere Port, and Birkenhead. They made a healthy operating profit until the 1870s, but this then diminished during the next 30 years. They looked at upgrading the canal to take larger vessels in the 1890s, prompted by the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal, but this did not occur. They saw a brief improvement in their financial position in the early 20th century, but this collapsed with the onset of the First World War. Government subsidies sustained them until 1920, but rising <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> and the 8-hour day resulted in them ceasing to act as a carrier, and the LNWR bought the company in late 1922. On 1 January 1923, the LNWR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), with the passing of the Railways Act 1921 (Grouping Act). The Montgomery Canal closed in 1936 after a major breach, and most of the canals were closed under the provisions of an abandonment order obtained in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|When {{human capital}} is {{assessed}} by activity based costing via time allocations it becomes possible to assess human capital risk.

Human capital risk occurs when the organization operates below attainable operational excellence levels. [...] For example, if a firm could reasonably reduce errors and rework (the Process component of human capital) from 10,000 hours per annum to 2,000 hours with attainable technology, the difference of 8,000 hours is human capital risk.

3000|$|Results {{according}} to workers’ age {{can be understood}} through additional hypothesis testing. Estimates, based on our benchmark regression (see Table  3), suggest that the education-driven <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential is smaller among young workers than among older workers (z-statistic[*]=[*]− 2.48 and p value[*]=[*] 0.01), while the contribution of education to firm’s value added is {{not found to be}} statistically different across age groups (z-statistics[*]=[*]− 0.58 and p value[*]=[*] 0.56). 40, 41 The observation that the <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential between high- and low-educated workers increases with workers’ age {{can be explained by the}} fact that white-collar workers in Belgium are much more likely to be paid {{according to}} seniority than their blue-collar counterparts (which are typically less educated); this is arguably a result of separate collective agreements for blue- and white-collar workers and more widespread use of seniority-related pay scales in the agreements covering the latter (for more details see, e.g. Kampelmann and Rycx 2013). As a result, seniority-pay profiles are generally much steeper for high- than low-educated workers. A complementary explanation is that labour market regulations essentially affect the lower end of the wage distribution. Hence, they are more likely to compress the <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential between low- and high-educated workers when they are young. 42 Overall, results thus suggest that high-educated (low-educated) workers are no longer under-paid (over-paid) when they become older because their <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> to productivity ratio increases at a faster (slower) pace during their career than that of low-educated (high-educated) workers. 43 [...]...|$|R

To do so, we use detailed linked employer-employee panel data for Belgium and rely on methodological approaches from both Hellerstein and Neumark (1995) and Bartolucci (2014) to estimate dynamic panel data models at the establishment level. Our findings show that interregional differences in productivity and wages are significant but vanish almost totally, both in industry and services, when controlling for a wide range of covariates, establishment fixed effects and endogeneity. Thus, our results suggest that <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> and productivity differentials are ceteris paribus relatively well aligned across regions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the impact of}} changes of total labor costs on {{employment}} of low-wage workers in France in a period, 1990 to 1998, that saw sudden and large changes in these costs. We use longitudinal data from the French Labor Force survey (? enqu?te emploi ?) {{in order to understand}} the consequences of real decreases and real increases of the labor cost. We examine the transition probabilities from employment to non-employment and from non-employment to employment. In particular, we compare the transition probabilities of the workers that were directly affected by the changes (?between? workers) with the transition probabilities of workers closest in the wage distribution to those directly affected (?marginal? workers). In all years with an increasing minimum <b>wage</b> <b>cost,</b> the ?between? group (or the treated using the vocabulary of controlled experiments) comprises all workers whose costs in year t lie between the old (year t) and the new (year t+ 1) minimum. In all years with a decreasing minimum, the ?between? group comprises all workers whose costs in year t+ 1 lie between the present minimum <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> (year t+ 1) and the old (year t) minimum <b>wage</b> <b>cost.</b> The results can be summarized as follows. Comparing years of increasing and decreasing minimum <b>wage</b> <b>cost,</b> difference-in-difference estimates imply that an increase of 1 % of the cost implies roughly an increase of 1. 5 % in the probability of transiting from employment to non-employment for the treated workers, the resulting elasticity being ? 1. 5. Second, results for the transitions from non-employment to employment are less clear-cut. Tax subsidies have a small and insignificant impact on entry from non-employment as well as on transitions within the wage distribution. Finally, there is no obvious evidence of substitution between the ?between? and ?marginal? groups of workers, but there is some evidence of substitution between workers within the tax subsidy zone, with wages above those of the ?marginal?, and workers outside the subsidy zone...|$|R
30|$|To sum up, {{our results}} show that firms located in Belgium face {{financial}} disincentives to employ low-educated workers, especially when they are young. We indeed find that firms employing {{a larger share of}} young low-educated workers tend to be less profitable. Policies aiming to improve the labour market prospects of young low-educated workers should thus try to boost their productivity and/or to decrease their <b>wage</b> <b>cost.</b> A substantial number of policies (i.e. training programmes, wage subsidies, reductions of social security contributions) are already implemented in Belgium to reach this goal. Yet, our findings suggest that these efforts should be continued and intensified (alongside policies fostering total employment). Furthermore, {{results show that}} the wage-compression effect only holds for women. This finding suggests that particular attention should be devoted to the productivity to <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> ratio of low-educated women but also to policies favouring gender equality in terms of remuneration and career advancement.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{alternative}} theories (based on tournaments, internal decision-making processes of organisations, monopsony or monitoring issues) suggest that low-educated workers might actually not be too costly relative to their marginal products (Lazear and Rosen 1981; Bebchuk and Fried 2003; Osterman et al. 2009), most policies aiming to increase the employability of low-educated people in the OECD area either try to foster the latters’ productivity (e.g. through specific training programmes) and/or to decrease their <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> (e.g. through reduced payroll taxes). Belgium is no exception in this respect. Indeed, it is among the highest spenders for active labour market policies in Europe (Eurostat 2016 b) and reductions in employers’ and personnel social security contributions (notably targeted on the low-skilled) represent around 1.8 % of GDP (Belgian federal government 2015). While these policies are quite standard to improve the labour market prospects of low-educated people, their effectiveness is still highly controversial (Heckman et al. 1999; Cahuc and Carcillo 2012; Kluve 2010; Card et al. 2010). This is notably due to {{the fact that}} it remains unclear whether education-induced productivity gains are well aligned with corresponding <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differentials. In particular, more evidence is needed on whether the productivity to <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> ratio of low-educated people is really critical for their employability. The objective of this paper is to improve our understanding of these issues with a specific focus on workers’ age and gender.|$|R
