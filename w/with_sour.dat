500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but {{on the island of}} [...] "Huamobel" [...] the people cut them up, squeeze out the [...] "black blood" [...] and cook them <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of chips and dip significantly {{increased in the}} United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant dehydrated onion soup mix to prepare dip. The advertising campaign occurred {{on television and in}} supermarket display advertising, and promoted mixing the soup mix <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> cream or cream cheese to create a dip, to be served with potato chips or crudités. This dip began to be called California Dip. The advertising campaign realized significant success, and new, similar dip products were quickly developed thereafter. During this time, unique platters designed for chips and dip service were created that allowed for the containment of several types of chips, and service variations were devised that included serving the dip in a bread bowl or hollowed-out fruit.|$|E

500|$|In Poland and Ukraine, borscht {{is usually}} {{one of the}} dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner. Celebrated after the first star has {{appeared}} in the sky on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which {{is at the same time}} festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin. Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> cream.

500|$|Ashkenazi Jews {{living in}} Eastern Europe adopted {{beetroot}} borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted {{it to their}} taste and religious requirements. As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (...) and dairy (...) [...] The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim {{so that it would}} be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the thick}} borschts {{described}} above, Polish cuisine offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as , or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat {{may be used for}} the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened <b>with</b> <b>sour</b> cream. , or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for [...] (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.|$|E
