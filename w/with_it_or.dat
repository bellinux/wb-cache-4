5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|The British mission {{consisting}} of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This {{was a critical}} time. Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision {{had to be made}} whether to persevere <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing that his company could get it ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944.|$|E

The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} story of 1948 for Pontiac was the {{addition}} of Hydramatic automatic transmission as an option. As of 1948 only General Motors sold cars with fully automatic transmissions and the only other way to get one was to buy a higher priced Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. Chevrolet would not introduce Powerglide until 1950, Ford FordoMatic until 1951 (Lincoln would start buying Hydramatics from GM in 1949), and Chrysler, PowerFlite on Imperials, until 1953. Hydramatic proved very popular {{with a total of}} 171,946 Pontiacs sold <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> about 71% of all Pontiacs, and with 122,327 Streamliners equipped <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> about 76% of all Streamliners, in its first year. Since Hydramatic was still only optional on Cadillac and Oldsmobile, and Dynaflow optional on Buick Roadmaster, given the total sales of Cadillac (50,619), Oldsmobile (173,661) and Buick Roadmaster (80,071), and the fact that Dynaflow was only introduced {{in the middle of the}} model year, this implies that probably over 40% of all cars sold with automatic transmissions in 1948 were Pontiacs.|$|E

25|$|Ideally, campfires {{should be}} made in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a {{temporary}} fire site may be constructed. Bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site. Alternatively, turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage. Another way is to cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, {{to a depth of}} a few inches. A ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire. Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> the rocks could crack.|$|E

25|$|The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was {{conceived}} {{as part of}} a network of canals which would allow coal from the Dudley Canal and the Stourbridge Canal to reach Oxford and London, without having to use the Birmingham canals, the management of which was seen as high-handed. An Act was passed on 28 March 1793 {{for the construction of a}} canal from a junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal in Kings Norton to Stratford-upon-Avon. The Canal Company was empowered to raise £120,000 by issuing shares and an additional £60,000 if required. The route would take it close to Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Lapworth, but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> with the River Avon at Stratford. Negotiations started with the Warwick and Birmingham, and to second act was obtained on 19 May 1795, to allow a connecting link to be built, despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company.|$|E

Roman (Kid Beyond) holds tight control {{as the leader of the}} group, and when Roberto, a scavenger, attempts to steal from the group on Day 236 of the outbreak, Roman debates whether to have him kill the scavenger or let him go and risk their safety, making Shel give the deciding vote. Sometime after on Day 259, the consequences of her choice have splintered the group's security or positivity. When another group member Stephanie (Dana Bauer) is caught stealing supplies, Roman asks Shel to kill her, leading Shel to consider either going through <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> fleeing the camp with Becca.|$|E

500|$|As Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich applied carrot-and-stick methods. Labour was reorganised on {{the basis}} of the German Labour Front. Heydrich used {{equipment}} confiscated from the Czech organisation Sokol to organise events for workers. Food rations and free shoes were distributed, pensions were increased, and (for a time) free Saturdays were introduced. Unemployment insurance was established for the first time. The black market was suppressed. Those associated <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> the resistance movement were tortured or executed. Heydrich labelled them [...] "economic criminals" [...] and [...] "enemies of the people", which helped gain him support. Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich, and industrial output increased. Still, those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation; reports of growing discontent multiplied.|$|E

500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> put it anywhere with his passing".
