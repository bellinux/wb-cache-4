Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here is a man who <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want.

In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements of all our industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population." [...] He wanted to bring in Austronesian immigrants from Asia-Pacific nations to save the declining population of the Hawaiian race from completely dying out. Prior labor immigration had been mostly unmarried men, and he hoped to attract unmarried women as potential wives for them, as well as bringing in family groups.|$|E

500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls her tone [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented here <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".|$|E

2500|$|In his keynote address, Powell {{spoke of}} the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial as a {{symbolic}} gesture of thanks to the military veterans it represents, and {{as a tool to}} educate youth on the meaning of military service. He stressed the role of young people in society and acknowledged that it was a teenage Town of Tonawanda resident that initiated the grassroots effort to build the memorial, saying that [...] "sometimes it is the youngest people in our community who understand what's important." [...] Powell further remarked that the memorial's location, in a public park and adjacent to a playground, means that it will be readily visible to local children and that [...] "it <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> them silently, but powerfully." [...] He also discussed his appreciation of military service throughout the history of the U.S. and of his own military service, including his time leading the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

Tesco's head of entertainment Rob Salter said in a statement: [...] "We are delighted that Nadine Coyle has agreed to entrust the first album of her solo career to Tesco. Nadine has delivered a real album with musical integrity and, most of all, that great big warm voice and fantastic songs which we believe <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> all of Tesco's customers." [...] The album itself will be released through Nadine's own label Black Pen Records. [...] "The traditional model for selling an album isn't {{the only way of}} doing things," [...] Nadine said. [...] "To be able to create an album where you are in complete control of your own work is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an artist." [...] Nadine is said to have turned down offers from various major labels, including Universal Music.|$|E
2500|$|Orthodox and Conservative Jews {{hold that}} the prophecy of Moses is {{held to be}} true; he is held to be the chief of all prophets, even of those who came before and after him. [...] This belief was {{expressed}} by Maimonides, who wrote that [...] "Moses was superior to all prophets, whether they preceded him or arose afterwards. [...] Moses attained the highest possible human level. [...] He perceived God to a degree surpassing every human that ever existed....God spoke to all other prophets through an intermediary. [...] Moses alone did not need this; [...] {{this is what the}} Torah means when God says [...] "Mouth to mouth, I <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] The great Jewish philosopher Philo understands this type of prophecy to be an extraordinarily high level of philosophical understanding, which had been reached by Moses and which enabled him to write the Torah through his own rational deduction of natural law. [...] Maimonides, in his Commentary to the Mishna (preface to chapter [...] "Chelek", Tractate Sanhedrin), and in his Mishneh Torah, (in the Laws of the foundations of the Torah, ch. 7), describes a similar concept of prophecy, since a voice that did not originate from a body cannot exist, the understanding of Moses was based on his lofty philosophical understandings.|$|E

2500|$|While the audience's {{behaviour}} at the archery event provoked {{criticism from}} the English team, the silver medallist, Alison Williamson, praised it on the other hand. Earlier reports held that the English team was upset because the loud chant of the crowd during the women's recurve event had distracted the archers. In an action condemned in the Indian media, an English archery official allegedly abused an Indian coach, telling him to [...] "f*** off." [...] The comment came after the Indian team registered a one-point win over England to claim the gold medal. The Indian archery head coach, Limba Ram, walked over {{to shake hands with}} officials of the rival team. In response, an English official showed his elbow in a gesture before uttering the remarks. Britain's archery team leader said she was unaware of the incident and added, [...] " [...] must find out whether the person was one among us. If he was not wearing a red jersey, he would not be part of the side. I <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the Indian coach about it." [...] Limba Ram said that he failed to identify the person as he had chosen to ignore the one-off incident. There have also been accusations that Ram was called a monkey on two different occasions by an English official.|$|E
2500|$|With Rosetta the Dardennes {{turned their}} {{focus to the}} burdens – philosophical, spiritual, {{psychological}} – of unemployment. Émilie Dequenne, who had not acted in film before, and was awarded the Best Actress Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, is the title character, a young woman living with her alcoholic mother in a trailer park. The film is about Rosetta's search for purpose and to Rosetta purpose can only be found through work – she makes her way through Seraing's fringes for the most menial of positions; she catches fish in the muddy, murky stream by her trailer park. Rosetta was the first Belgian film ever to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, coming in ahead of films by David Lynch, Pedro Almodóvar, Takeshi Kitano, and Raoul Ruiz. The film provided some impetus for a labor law designed to protect young workers like Rosetta shortly after the film's release. [...] "’t was pure chance,’ Jean-Pierre insists. ‘There was already a bill going through, and the minister took advantage of our award {{to call it the}} Rosetta Law. But we never intended to get laws changed.’ Luc adds: ‘Of course, we always hope our films <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> people, disturb them, but we never hoped to change the world’." ...|$|E
2500|$|Booster and Skeets {{appeared}} {{as members of}} the Justice League in the DC animated universe series Justice League Unlimited voiced by Tom Everett Scott, while Skeets was voiced by Billy West. Booster appeared in several episodes with non-speaking roles. He spoke in one episode, [...] "The Greatest Story Never Told", which focused on him. In the episode, a self-promoted Booster, who was excluded from the League's fight against Mordru and was assigned to crowd control during the battle, noticed that physicist Dr. Tracy Simmons' experiment had gone wrong, causing her partner Dr. Daniel Brown, to uncontrollably walk around while having a black hole on his chest. Booster tried to stop Daniel on his own, but repeatedly failed. Realizing he could not be a hero just looking for fame, he decided to become a true hero and finally stopped Daniel and closed the black hole, which had almost swallowed the city. Despite finally being heroic, no one knew what he had achieved. Following Mordru's defeat, Batman approached Booster wondering why he left crowd control. When he is unable to explain what happened while the other superheroes were fighting Mordru, Batman tells him that he <b>will</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him later. To Booster's delight, Tracy asks him out to thank him. In his subsequent appearances in the series, Booster performs his duties in a more professional manner.|$|E
