30|$|Until 2006, a “bad weather-component” {{was also}} part of the AZR. The number of lost hours and the {{affected}} employees due to bad weather were recorded {{to the extent that the}} BA paid benefits until 2006. The loss of working hours through bad weather was by definition only possible in the construction sector. In 2007 the bad weather compensation (Winterbauförderung) was replaced by the seasonal short time <b>working</b> <b>allowance</b> (see above). Therefore the time-series on working hours lost due to bad weather end in 2006 (see Appendix A, Table A. 1) and are captured in line with the total short time <b>working</b> <b>allowance</b> component from 2007 on.|$|E
40|$|A {{clamping}} robot serving {{for several}} NC machines can recognize the best fit in manny blank parts. Forthermore, the shape information acquisition and pose measurment {{can be achieved}} by its computer vision system. The key question is that the clamping robot automatively choices the best fit part by statistical result of geometric dimension of all parts. The best fit part is the one that its length and its diameter are mostly proximate to the processing requirement. This choice method can save staff, reduce <b>working</b> <b>allowance,</b> and lessen finished cost. According to the shape information and position information, the robot can confirm the grab order, grab angle and finger joint distance. Firstly, the part image is smoothing by noise reduction technology, secondly, the feature points are extracted. The feature points present the information of the location of the mass center, the dip angle and diameter. Finally, the clamping robot can grab the most fit bar part by means of rotational motion, rectilinear motion, and finger open-close movement when the shape information and location information of the bar part have been confirmed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

30|$|Table  1 {{shows the}} most {{important}} features of the German model. The central pillars of the system are effectively corporist structures and a strong social partnership, a relatively generous social security system {{that is at the}} core of Bismarck-type social security (status-oriented and mainly financed by social contributions). The economy is geared toward export-oriented manufacturing, benefiting from a well-developed system of dual vocational training and a well-educated workforce. Fluctuations are relatively minor. Wage bargaining takes place at the intermediate (sectoral, regional) level; however, through wage-leadership (Lohnführerschaft), the outcomes at the aggregate level are rather similar. Although union coverage takes place only at the intermediate level, the strong role of unions in the bargaining process leads to a solidaristic wage policy (low wage dispersion). Federal institutions are engaged in active labor market policy and the buffering of labor market shocks through short-term <b>working</b> <b>allowances</b> and other instruments. The financing of companies depends on a house-bank system. Finally, the German system relies on a solid infrastructure, especially with respect to transport and logistics but also in relation to the legal system.|$|R
3000|$|... (i) Robert Boyer {{emphasizes}} the “strong complementarity between product strategy and human resource management” (Boyer 2006, p.  137). An important characteristic of labor {{relations in the}} German model is the priority of within-firm flexibility relative to external flexibility 5. The preference for retaining a qualified workforce even during severe recessions stems from the high importance of firm-specific capital, which originates from the needs of export-oriented diversified quality production. This product strategy requires the flexible use of equipment by highly skilled workers that is crucial for specialized firms facing highly volatile product demand in the world market. Labor hoarding during periods of slack demand is a suitable instrument, especially if this behavior is publically supported through generous short-term <b>working</b> <b>allowances.</b> However, labor hoarding in combination with massive reductions in working hours and temporary earnings moderation requires mechanisms of social partnership and trust. Work councils serve as intermediaries to arbitrate between the conflicting interests of management and workers. Hence, this institution {{plays a key role}} in organizing within-firm flexibility through various measures to stabilize employment. Moreover, a social partnership is also required in regard to fostering training measures and high workplace security standards. Traditionally, the system of well-functioning labor relations in Germany is especially developed in the manufacturing sector, where there are high levels of unionization and collective bargaining coverage.|$|R
40|$|Student {{employment}} is usually thought to curb academic achievement. Our research relating {{to a survey}} at a French university in 2012 emphasizes {{the significance of the}} intensity of student <b>working</b> hours. <b>Allowance</b> for the endogeneity of student employment reinforces the negative effects, particularly for young people working more than 16 hours a week. However, the academic achievement of those working fewer than 8 hours per week seems unaffected. The type of employment also affects the chances of success: students with public sector jobs appear to be less prone to failure, possibly because of more flexible working hours...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study is}} {{intended}} to analyze: a) the issue of higher education under funding; b) the “disguised subsidizing” of higher education based on tuition fees; c) the supplementary revenues sources for universities; d) the funding mechanisms of higher education. We aim to incite debate on {{the relation between the}} educational policy and the funding strategy of higher education at both national and operational levels, instancing the case of the Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. The fundamental guide marks of this analysis are: the average cost per student, the budgetary allowance and the tuition fee. What sources of supplementary revenues for universities are there? What kind of scientific research provides incomes? Which university services generate supplementary resources? How can the university infrastructure be “exploited”? In what measure the cooperation and partnership opportunities with the economic and social environment are being identified? Which are the facilities, the steering directions, the conditions and the benefits of accessing European Structural Funds? With the purpose of answering these questions we have conceived a funding strategy model, entailing: regulations, institutional infrastructure, <b>working</b> instruments, budgetary <b>allowance</b> distribution models, educational costs estimation methods, funding mechanisms, all these operating in a gearing meant to attain, by solving the problems, the objectives of higher education policy.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a descriptive {{analysis on the}} role of motivation on academic staff performance. Following the neglect of motivation practices in many higher learning institutions, the academic staff have opted to move on as usual at the expense of students who need their expertise. The paper acknowledges that higher learning institutions have several motivational packages to boost the performance but these were depicted as being not enough to incite a sense of commitment towards teaching, research, publication and supervision. To arrive at this, part of the sample i. e. 75 respondents comprising Associate Professors, Senior Lecturers, Lecturers, Assistant Lecturers, and Tutorial Assistants was obtained using simple random sampling and 4 key informants; two Deputy Principals and two Faculty Deans were purposively sampled out to constitute a sample of 79 respondents for the study. The study was guided by three research questions. A self-developed 4 -Point Likert structured questionnaire, semi-structured interview questions, discussions and documentary reviews were the main instruments used in collecting data. Quantitative data collected were analyzed with descriptive statistics using a 4 -Point Likert scale and qualitative using Content Analysis. Low monthly salaries were the major factor that dissatisfied academic staff and reduced motivation for high performance at the University. It is concluded and recommended that motivational aspects like salary, <b>allowances,</b> <b>working</b> conditions, recognition and career advancement once well managed and provided then better performance of academic staff is guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|Background To explore {{factors that}} motivate members of staff at Adventist health {{facilities}} in Malawi {{to maximize their}} potential for work and improve their welfare. This was a qualitative study that utilized group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care staff members. Methods Four group discussions with health care workers and support staff were conducted. Results: Both motivating and demotivating factors were found. The motivating factors were spiritual nourishment of the institutions and working conditions with long term benefits for individuals and their families. The demotivating factors were unfair treatment without respect to staff by management. Specific areas like <b>working</b> condition, housing, <b>allowances,</b> training, communication, and personal support were highlighted {{as some of the}} factors that poorly motivated staff to stay at the health facility Further, issues related to the loose of purpose, where Christian values were seen to be deteriorating were observed to be undermining mission of the institutions. Conclusions Staff motivation is vital in any working condition in as far as good performance at the work environment is concerned. Poor working conditions have not been exceptions among the Adventist health institutions. Based on these findings, the study recommended that conditions of services for the Adventist health facilities need to be revised and implemented accordingly; training of staff for further facility development to be intensified, communication between management and health care staff through scheduled routine meetings need to be strengthened. Spiritual nourishment through staff interaction with church officials and pastors should always be considered. A further study is needed to look at the community perceptions towards the services offered in the Adventist health facilities...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the {{argument}} are those who contend that no surplus value was generated from labour activity or from commodity markets in the socialist planned economies and therefore claim that there was no exploiting class, even if inequalities existed. Since prices were controlled and set below market clearing levels there was no element of ‘value added’ at the point of sale as occurs in capitalist market economies. Prices were built up from the average cost of inputs, including wages, taxes, interest on stocks and <b>working</b> capital, and <b>allowances</b> to cover the recoupment of investment and for depreciation, so there was no ‘profit margin’ in the price charged to customers. Wages did not reflect the purchase price of labour since labour was not a commodity traded in a market and the employing organizations did not own the means of production. Wages were set at a level that permitted a decent standard of living and rewarded specialist skills and educational qualifications. In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers’ own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society. Furthermore, the presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the USSR communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although they received privileges not commonly available and thus some additional income in kind there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers. Enterprise managers and workers received only the wages and bonuses related to the production targets that had been set by the planning authorities. Outside of the cooperative sector, which enjoyed greater economic freedoms and whose profits were shared among all members of the cooperative, there was no profit-taking class.|$|R
