Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E

25|$|Male M. rosenbergii prawns have {{a strict}} hierarchy: the {{territorial}} BC males dominate the OCs, {{which in turn}} dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will keep growing until it {{is larger than the}} largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming. All three male stages are sexually active, though, and females which have undergone their premating molt <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> with any male to reproduce. BC males protect the females until their shells have hardened; OCs and SMs show no such behavior.|$|E
25|$|As female fetuses {{have two}} X {{chromosomes}} and male ones a XY pair, the chromosome Y is the responsible for producing male differentiation on the defect female development. The differentiation process {{is driven by}} androgen hormones, mainly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The newly formed testicles in the fetus {{are responsible for the}} secretion of androgens, that <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> in driving the sexual differentiation of the developing fetus, including its brain. This results in sexual differences between males and females. This fact has led some scientists to test in various ways the result of modifying androgen exposure levels in mammals during fetus and early life.|$|E

25|$|Adventure {{games have}} strong storylines with {{significant}} dialog, and sometimes make {{effective use of}} recorded dialog or narration from voice actors. This genre of game is known for representing dialog as a conversation tree. Players are able to engage a non-player character by choosing a line of pre-written dialog from a menu, which triggers a response from the game character. These conversations are often designed as a tree structure, with players deciding between each branch of dialog to pursue. However, there are always {{a finite number of}} branches to pursue, and some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one. Conversing with characters can reveal clues about how to solve puzzles, including hints about what that character would want before they <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the player. Other conversations will have far-reaching consequences, deciding to disclose a valuable secret that has been entrusted to the player. Characters may also be convinced to reveal their own secrets, either through conversation or by giving them something that will benefit them.|$|E
500|$|Fastow {{disclosed}} to Enron's {{board of directors}} on October 22 that he earned $30 million from compensation arrangements when managing the LJM limited partnerships. That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as [...] "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of [...] "share settled costless collar arrangements," [...] "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts," [...] and strategies that served [...] "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." [...] Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business. Regarding the SEC investigation, chairman and CEO Lay said, [...] "We <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> fully with the S.E.C. {{and look forward to}} the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Nuptial flight occurs {{throughout}} the year in humid and warm climates. The alates begin to emerge from their nest and immediately climb onto tall structures (such as tree trunks, fence-posts, or long flora) where they begin to fly and copulate. Depending on the species, a queen either mates with a single male or with multiple males. Observations show that meat ant males begin to fly first, followed by the queens. Groups of 20 to 40 queens will approach {{the top of the}} nest and fly once they are warm enough, and this would proceed multiple times for many days until the climate changes or all of the queens have withdrawn from the nest. After mating, the males soon die and the queens proceed to search for a suitable nest to establish her colony. Finding a location to nest is dangerous, as birds and other ants prey on them; disease and starvation are other causes of death in queens. While most queens will establish a nest by herself, nests can be established when queens cooperate with each other, are adopted into an existing colony, or by [...] "budding" [...] (also called [...] "satelliting" [...] or [...] "fractionating"), where a subset of the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site. 10% of queens <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> with another queen during colony foundation.|$|E

50|$|Monergism {{states that}} the {{regeneration}} of an individual {{is the work of}} God through the Holy Spirit alone, as opposed to Synergism, which, in its simplest form, argues that the human <b>will</b> <b>cooperates</b> with God's grace in order to be regenerated. To most synergists, regeneration is a process that begins when a man responds to God's initiative, repents, and begins the labor of loving God and his neighbor. Monergists believe that regeneration takes place as a single act in which God regenerates a man from his fleshly state and, thus now enabled, a man can believe, and that he inevitably and invariably will do so.|$|R

2500|$|The {{interaction}} between two neighbours can be modelled as an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. In this view, a territory owner that acts non-aggressively towards a neighbour {{can be thought}} of as cooperating, while a territory owner that acts aggressively towards its neighbour can be considered to have defected. A necessary condition for the prisoner’s dilemma game to hold is that an aggressive individual should enjoy greater benefits than a non-aggressive individual when each is faced with a non-aggressive opponent. This stipulation is plausible, as an aggressive individual might enlarge their territory or steal food or matings from a non-aggressive individual. [...] When cooperation involves a cost, a possible mechanism for achieving stable co-operation is reciprocal altruism, where pairs of individuals trade bouts of cooperative behaviour with one another. [...] Dear enemy cooperation could be explained by reciprocal altruism if territorial neighbours use conditional strategies such as tit-for-tat. In the tit-for-tat strategy, a subject <b>will</b> <b>cooperate</b> when its partner (neighbour) cooperates and defect when the partner defects.|$|E

60|$|Since, however, it is {{apparent}} that here, as in every other state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side. While under this general recommendation provision for defending our seacoast line readily occurs to the mind, I also in the same connection ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defense and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report, upon the same general subject. I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of east Tennessee and western North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the Union by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the construction of such road as speedily as possible. Kentucky no doubt <b>will</b> <b>cooperate,</b> and through her legislature make the most judicious selection of a line. The northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasville to the Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville, or on some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Government cooperating, the work can be completed in a very short time, and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.|$|E
