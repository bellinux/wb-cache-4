5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, whose <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> {{have played}} the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project.

Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by Jury was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E

Filming started {{in the morning and}} finished by sixp.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his <b>wife</b> <b>would</b> dine at Chasen's).
