5|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} Misch {{from further}} service; {{he was free}} to leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of the last people remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping Misch, Schädle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.|$|E

25|$|O'Donoghue hid {{a number}} of unused grenades on the farm {{and the two men}} went their {{separate}} ways. At about 2AM at least eight armed men entered the house and <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside and were asked their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire. Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea, was wounded by gunfire. According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents. It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used bloodhounds to follow the scent to the Delaney home.|$|E

The singer took several cast members and some friends home with her for a small party. She <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> to bed at about 3 a.m. Miranda undressed, placed her platform shoes in a corner, lit a cigarette, placed it in an ashtray and went into her bathroom to remove her makeup.

In the same season Pakistan visited Sri Lanka, and played three Tests against them. During the second Test, Two unpleasant incidents occurred: when an umpire started rubbing the new ball replaced with the older one on the ground, during Pakistan's second innings after sixteen overs to get the similar characteristics; Pakistan manager came to the umpire and showed him the 1985 Wisden's relevant Law; and Miandad's disagreement to the umpire's decision of lbw against him. Later on someone from the crowd threw a stone upon Miandad, and he <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> into the crowd to take revenge from the spectator.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the museum}} was {{equipped}} with motion detectors, the thieves' movements throughout the museum were recorded. After tying up the guards, the thieves <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> to the Dutch Room. As one of them approached Rembrandt's Self-Portrait (1629), a local alarm sounded, which they immediately smashed. They pulled the painting {{off the wall and}} [...] attempted to take the wooden panel out of its heavy frame. Unsuccessful at the attempt, they left the painting on the floor. They cut Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee out of the frame, as well as A Lady and Gentleman in Black. [...] They also removed Vermeer's The Concert and Govaert Flinck's Landscape with an Obelisk from their frames. Additionally, they also took a Chinese bronze gu from the Shang Dynasty.|$|E

NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E
500|$|The {{first problem}} with the {{evidence}} {{is the use of}} inmate informant evidence, such as that from Michael Wainwright, described as [...] "the most disreputable [...] of all", {{despite the fact that it}} was one of the key pieces of evidence in the trial. Glen Banks, a man with whom Park had briefly shared a cell and who claimed in court that Park had admitted his guilt to him, was described as [...] "highly suggestible", frequently changed his story, and also claimed that Park had admitted to killing Carol while sailing to Blackpool. Wainwright, the other informant, was said to be a heavy cannabis smoker and admitted to hearing voices. He claimed that Gordon had said that he <b>went</b> <b>upstairs,</b> found Carol in bed with another man, and killed her in a fit of rage. This seemed unlikely, as the Parks lived in a bungalow, and the supposed lover has never come forward. Park also claimed to have never actually met Wainwright.|$|E

2500|$|He {{stayed there}} for four seasons and played firstly under Ron Atkinson and then former Leeds {{teammate}} Gordon Strachan. McAllister was a big name recruit to Big Ron's team of 1996–97. Yet the side, well garnished with typical Atkinson flair {{in the form of}} Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby never seemed to quite 'click' in the way of league results. Atkinson <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> to become 'Director of Football' in late 1996 in order to make way for Strachan. Strachan's team continued to struggle that season but would go on to stage one of [...] the Premiership's greatest ever escapes. With McAllister captaining the side, the Sky Blues would secure an away draw against Arsenal and wins against Chelsea, Liverpool (away) and Tottenham Hotspur (away) to secure a seemingly impossible salvation.|$|E

[...] On April 25, 1958, King made her first appearance at a concert that year at Peter High School Auditorium in Birmingham, Alabama. With a performance sponsored by the Omicron Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, King changed a few songs {{in the first part of}} the show but still continued with the basic format used two years earlier at the New York gala as she told the story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience [...] "an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation." ...|$|E

This {{was going to be an}} extensive stay, as his wife accompanied Short on the trip. The racing season was about to begin and Johnson and Short both owned a string of horses that would be running at Washington Park in Chicago. During his several visits to Chicago, Short and Hattie always stayed at the Leland Hotel. Short was accosted in the lobby of the Leland by a drunken attorney named James J. Singleton during late October 1891. According to the report, Short did not have his pistol, but managed to give Singleton a few kicks which knocked him down, and then Short picked him up, and pushed him out [...] "into the frosty night air." [...] Short then <b>went</b> <b>upstairs</b> for his gun in case Singleton decided to return. While Short was gone, an actor named William F. Hoey (1854–1897) walked into the hotel lobby. The actor turned out to resemble closely the lawyer Short had just kicked out. Short saw Hoey, thought he was Singleton, and charged at him with his pistol. A quick-thinking hotel clerk named Ed Kennedy jumped between the two men and prevented a homicide. When Short realized his mistake, he apologized to the actor and treated him to drinks and a late supper.|$|E
