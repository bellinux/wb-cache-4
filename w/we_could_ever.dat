500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have imagined." [...] On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage {{for the first time at}} the Cabaret Metro.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences {{announced}} {{the retirement of}} the award category. President and CEO Neil Portnow stated that the Academy needed {{to do so in}} order to remain a [...] "relevant and responsive" [...] organization within a [...] "dynamic music community". Polka musicians and fans were disappointed with the category elimination. Three-time award winner Walter Ostanek admitted he [...] " [...] sorry for the future artists" [...] that would fail to be recognized by the Academy. Carl Finch of the group Brave Combo stated the following: [...] "Having a polka category was the most important step to legitimacy that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> hope to achieve. To have that taken away, it's like it was all for nothing." [...] Apart from ensuring that the [...] "awards process remains representative of the current musical landscape", the Academy cited dwindling competition as one reason for the category retirement. Others speculated that Jimmy Sturr's eighteen wins led to the elimination. Due to the elimination of a polka-specific category, polka musicians are likely to submit recordings in the folk and world music categories.|$|E
500|$|Tonight {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album has a total score of 70/100 on Metacritic, based on 32 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews". It {{did not receive}} the amount of critical acclaim their first two studio albums received. Critics often praised the album's sound and the instrumentation of the songs on the album. The album's sound was also subject to criticism by some critics, {{as well as the}} lyrics and album production. Clash magazine commented that it could be [...] "the band's most complete work to date. Worth the wait, and in all honesty better than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have hoped for." [...] The Financial Post states that [...] "Tonight is the band's best album: Paradoxically, they've allowed themselves a degree of release from their characteristic tension by creating structures within which they can cut loose." [...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything that has made the band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one. Smart and danceable, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand proves that Franz Ferdinand are the masters of dance-rock." [...] NBC commented on how 'Franz Ferdinand has once again managed to outdo themselves with their best album to date.' ...|$|E

500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> discover!" ...|$|E

During the opening days in Afghanistan, we deployed some SF teams without a CCT, {{and the difference between}} those that had controllers and those that didn’t was dramatic. Quite frankly no one wants to go to war without them. They are admired, capable, and requested at a rate far greater than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> provide.

2500|$|Frederick Buechner's lifelong {{love affair}} with Bermuda began with his family's escape from the trauma of his father's suicide. [...] In Telling Secrets, Buechner {{described}} [...] "the blessed relief of {{coming out of the}} dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." [...] Bermuda was [...] "a place where healing could happen in a way that perhaps {{would not have been possible}} anywhere else and to a degree that—even with all the endurance, will, courage we might have been able to muster had we stayed —I do not think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have achieved on our own." [...] For a child who had never known familial stability even before his father's death, Bermuda became home. [...] As Buechner explained, [...] "In that never-never land, that Oz of an island, where we had no roots, I found for the first time a sense of being rooted." [...] "All in all it seems to me, looking back, that I lived there with a greater sense of permanence than any place we had lived earlier." ...|$|E
