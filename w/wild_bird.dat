40|$|ABSTRACT As natural hosts for avian {{influenza}} virus (AIV), <b>wild</b> <b>birds,</b> particularly aquatic birds, {{are the primary}} reservoir for transmission of AIV to domestic poultry. Therefore, understanding the dissemination and maintenance of AIV in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> is important for un-derstanding the {{factors that contribute to}} transmission of AIV from <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> to poultry. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} ecology of the virus in <b>wild</b> <b>birds,</b> and the depth of data are inconsistent worldwide. Also, the biology of the virus itself is very important, because AIV is highly adaptable to different hosts and likely to the environment as well. Some insight may be gained from the Asian H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic AIV lineage, because surveillance for this virus has increased considerably in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> worldwide since 2005. Also, numerous species that have not previously been repre-sented in AIV testing have been included in surveillance for the Asian H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic AIV, allowing for a more complete understanding of the distribution of AIV in <b>wild</b> <b>birds.</b> The ecology of {{avian influenza}} virus in wild birds: What does this mean for poultry?...|$|R
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{originated}} in the Middle East and spread, along with agriculture, to most of Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Since the mid-19th century, it has reached most of the world, chiefly due to deliberate introductions, but also through natural and shipborne dispersal. Its introduced range encompasses most of North America, Central America, southern South America, southern Africa, part of West Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and islands throughout the world. It has greatly extended its range in northern Eurasia since the 1850s, and continues to do so, as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of Iceland and Rishiri Island, Japan. The extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> on the planet.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI), which originate in poultry upon transmission of low pathogenic viruses from <b>wild</b> <b>birds,</b> have occurred relatively {{frequently in the}} last decade. During our ongoing surveillance studies in <b>wild</b> <b>birds,</b> we isolated several influenza A viruses of hemagglutinin subtype H 5 and H 7 that contain various neuraminidase subtypes. For each of the recorded H 5 and H 7 HPAI outbreaks in Europe since 1997, our collection contained closely related virus isolates recovered from <b>wild</b> <b>birds,</b> as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin gene and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. The minor genetic and antigenic diversity between the viruses recovered from <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> and those causing HPAI outbreaks indicates that influenza A virus surveillance studies in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> can help generate prototypic vaccine candidates and design and evaluate diagnostic tests, before outbreaks occur in animals and humans. <b>Wild</b> <b>birds,</b> predominantly ducks, geese, and shorebirds, form the reservoir of influenza A viruses in nature (1, 2). Influenza A viruses are subtyped {{on the basis of}} the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins, expressed on the surface of virus particles. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been detected in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> and poultry throughout the world (3, 4). Viruses containing HA of subtypes H 5 and H 7 may become highly pathogenic after introduction in poultry and cause outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, formerly termed fowl plague) (1, 2).

Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997.

40|$|A {{large number}} of occurrences of the highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> were reported in Europe. The relationship between the occurrence pattern and environmental factors has, however, not yet been explored. This research uses logistic regression to quantify the relationships between anthropogenic or physical environmental factors and HPAI H 5 N 1 occurrences. Our results indicate that HPAI H 5 N 1 occurrences are highly correlated with the following: the increased normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in December; intermediate NDVI in March; lower elevations; increased minimum temperatures in January; and reduced precipitation in January. A predictive risk map of HPAI H 5 N 1 occurrences in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> in Europe was generated {{on the basis of}} five key environmental factors. Independent validation of the risk map showed the predictive model to be of high accuracy (79 %).

We therefore deduced that HPAI H 5 N 1 occurrences in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> in Europe are probably caused by contact with other <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> and not by contact with domestic poultry.
