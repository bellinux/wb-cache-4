500|$|At 10:00 on 26 August, the Archer-class {{protected}} cruiser Racoon {{arrived at}} Zanzibar Town and was anchored {{in line with}} Thrush and Sparrow. At 14:00, the Edgar-class protected cruiser St George, flagship of the Cape and East Africa Station, steamed into the harbour. On board were Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson and further British marines and sailors. At {{around the same time}} Lord Salisbury's reply arrived authorising Cave and Rawson to use the resources at their disposal to remove Khalid from power. The telegraph read: [...] "You are authorised to adopt whatever measures you may consider necessary, and will be supported in your action by Her Majesty's Government.

500|$|With {{his left}} hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States {{successfully}} {{at the start of}} 1930, propped up by his recent European success. That year Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet On the Dnieper, Op. 51, a work commissioned by Serge Lifar, who had been appointed maitre de ballet at the Paris Opéra. In 1931 and 1932, he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos. The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song, Op. 57, which Prokofiev's friend Myaskovsky – thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union – told him [...] "isn't quite for us... it lacks that which we mean by monumentalism – a familiar simplicity and broad contours, of <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> extremely capable, but temporarily are carefully avoiding." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Bhelpuri" [...] {{was filmed}} on the lead pair near Pangong Tso, Ladakh in May 2014 under the {{supervision}} of choreographer Dinesh. Few portions were filmed at Leh for ten days with great difficulty {{under the supervision}} of choreographer Prem Rakshith. Tamannaah called it [...] "one of the most difficult songs I have ever done", adding that it is a [...] "full on dance number, unlike a song in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> walking away and looking pretty". During the shoot, the car used by Vaitla and his team got stuck in the Nubra Valley for seven hours. The manager lost his voice and the others developed severe headaches. The song was filmed for ten days at that altitude and Vaitla flew 300 people in a flight for the same.|$|E

500|$|Sony {{received}} {{criticism for}} canceling the wide release. Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote {{that it was}} an [...] "unprecedented defeat on American turf", but that [...] "North Korea will find that their bullying edict will haunt them." [...] In the Capital and Gizmodo suggested the cancellation caused a Streisand effect, whereby the attempt to remove or censor a work has the unintended consequence of publicizing it more widely. In a press conference, U.S. President Barack Obama said that though he was sympathetic to Sony's need to protect employees, he thought Sony had [...] "made a mistake. We cannot have a society in which some dictator in some place can start imposing censorship in the United States. I wish they'd spoken to me first. I would have told them: do not get into the pattern in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> intimidated." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> allowed to decide a few things on your own, you have free time between classes [...] you can do your own things, {{and there is a lot}} of musical culture in the school. It tends to allow you to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E
