40|$|Examination of the {{contents}} of the three types of silo in use at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station showed the following chemical changes during the actual period of silage formation. 1. Non-reducing sugar was rapidly changed to reducing sugar, and the latter then decreased in amount but did not disappear completely. 2. The amount of volatile acids increased daily. 3. In the concrete silo, as already demonstrated for the hollow tile and <b>wooden</b> stave <b>silos,</b> the racemic lactic acid produced showed a daily increase. 4.

40|$|A {{system to}} turn a {{potentially}} harmful stream of solid waste into a set of substreams with either commercial value or highly concentrated residual streams is presented. The waste which is considered is metal impregnated (in particular Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) treated) wood waste and timber, such as telephone poles, railway sleepers, timber from landscape and cooling towers, <b>wooden</b> <b>silos,</b> hop-poles, cable drums and wooden playground equipment. These waste streams sum up to several 100, 000 tons of material per year currently to be dumped in every major country of the European Community (EC). Technologies {{need to be developed}} to reduce this CCA treated wood waste, such that all of the metals are contained in a marketable product stream, and the pyrolysis gases and/or pyrolysis liquid are used to their maximum potential with respect to energy recuperation. Pyrolysing the CCA treated wood waste may be a good solution to the growing disposal problem since low temperatures and no oxidising agents are used, which result in lower loss of metals compared to combustion. An experimental labscale pyrolysis system has been developed to study the influence of the pyrolysis temperature and the duration of the pyrolysis process on the release of metals and the mass reduction. The macrodistribution and microdistribution of the metals in the solid pyrolysis residue is studied using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM-EDXA). Furthermore, a complete mass balance is calculated over the pyrolysis system. Based on these results a semi-industrial pyrolysis system (pilot plant scale) has been developed consisting of three stages: grinding, packed bed pyrolysis and metal separation. Special types of equipment have been developed to carry out the three stages. A new grinding system has been developed, based on a crushing mechanism rather than a cutting mechanism. The crushed wood is introduced by means of a screw feeding system into a reaction column. In this pyrolysis reactor the wood is heated by subjecting it to a flow of hot gases. This causes an adiabatic pyrolysis, which results in volatilisation of the volatile compounds whereas the mineral compounds (containing the metals) remain entrapped in a coal-type residue which is very rich in carbon. The condensable compounds in the pyrolysis gas condense while leaving the reaction zone due to the inverse temperature gradient. The pyrolysis gas leaving the reactor is used as fuel for the hot gas generator. The charcoal which is extracted {{at the bottom of the}} reactor, is cooled, compressed, removed and stored, ready to feed the subsequent stage. A specially developed grinder is used to remove the metal particles from the charcoal and the separation between metal and charcoal particles is accomplished in a pneumatic centrifuge as a result of the difference in density. Using this system the ultimate waste is less than 3 % of the initial wood mass. Results obtained with a semi-industrial scale prototype confirm the effectiveness of the process. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on the {{comparative}} analysis of temperature variation within wooden and metal grain silos under a typical tropical weather condition in Nigeria. Temperature variations {{within and outside the}} silos were monitored for 130 days (July to November) during storage of maize. Results showed that the grain temperature at the centre of the silos ranged between 24. 0 - 32. 7 Â°C and 23. 8 - 35. 0 Â°C for wooden and metal silos respectively. Also, at the silo walls, grain temperatures ranged between 24. 5 - 35. 8 Â°C and 24. 0 - 34. 7 Â°C respectively. The standard error of estimate between the results of the silos at the centres and walls were 1. 65 Â°C and 1. 16 Â°C respectively. The temperatures {{at the top of the}} metal silo (grain surface) were 1. 9 Â°C and 4. 1 Â°C higher than those of the <b>wooden</b> <b>silo</b> and ambient respectively. It can be concluded that <b>wooden</b> <b>silo</b> is more effective at temperature control than metal silo under the tropical conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance of <b>wooden</b> <b>silo</b> for long-term (wet and dry seasons) storage of maize (Zea mays) under tropical climate. A one tonne capacity, 1. 4 m diameter and 1. 1 m height hexagonal <b>wooden</b> <b>silo</b> was constructed and erected in Minna. The silo was of Iroko (Melicia excelsa) ribs and exterior grade (redwood) plywood stress-skin panel as sheathing material. It had double-layered wall panels with a small air gap in-between the layers, for adequate heat insulation. A loading door and discharge chute were located on the wall panels and a triangular loading door on the top panels. The silo floor rested on wooden pile foundation. Grain and ambient temperature measurements and silo evaluation were done for 9 months. The ambient temperatures during the dry season were 40 C- 70 C higher than during the wet season. The minimum and maximum ambient temperatures were 20. 90 C (31 st day of storage, wet season) and 380 C (189 th day of storage, dry season) respectively. There were no incidences of moisture condensation within the silo. The structure possessed adequate structural integrity except for slight incidences, colour change, delaminating and peelings of sheathing materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{transient heat}} conduction equation was solved by finite-difference method to predict temperature variations within the maize (Zea mays) bin. The mathematical model comprises the center, {{interior and exterior}} heat transfer equations. Variables used include bin diameter, bin-wall material, grain temperatures, grain thermal and air properties. Software was developed for the model in Visual Basic. Temperatures within the silo were predicted at radii 0. 0 m (silo center), 0. 35 m, and 0. 7 m (Silo Wall) and depths 0. 0 m (Silo Floor), 0. 30 m, 0. 70 m and 1. 1 m (Silo Top). To validate the model, a 1 - ton capacity, 1. 4 m diameter and 1. 1 m height <b>wooden</b> <b>silo</b> was constructed to measure grain temperatures at the same radii and depths within the silo and ambient temperatures between July 1998 and March 1999 (9 months). Predicted and measured temperatures at the various radii and depths were in good agreement and not significantly different using F- test at 5 % level of significance. Temperature gradient decreases from the wall towards the center and from the top to the floor. Wooden bin maintained lower temperatures than ambient temperatures at all seasons...|$|E
