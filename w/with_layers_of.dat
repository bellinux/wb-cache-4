5|$|In prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, {{although}} in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded {{and most of}} the cell cytoplasm is filled <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> light-gathering membrane.

5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired molecules from the cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic concept}} of Gibanica, a cake or pie {{involving}} {{a combination of}} pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) {{is part of the}} cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the axial and flexural strength of reinforced concrete (RC) columns with no-rounded corners wrapped with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) under eccentric loading based on an experimental program. The main parameters under investigation are the number <b>of</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> CFRP wrap. Thirty-six concrete cylinders with a standard size of (150 × 300) mm were cast and tested in this study to get the modulus of elasticity and compressive strength of concrete. Of these 36 concrete cylinders were divided into four groups, unwrapped, wrapped <b>with</b> one <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> CFRP, wrapped <b>with</b> two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> CFRP, and wrapped <b>with</b> three <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> CFRP. Twelve rectangular reinforced concrete columns were also cast and tested in this study.   The column specimens had dimensions (75 × 75 × 750) mm with no-rounded corners of the column section.   The column specimens were also divided into four groups, unwrapped, wrapped <b>with</b> one <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> CFRP, wrapped <b>with</b> two <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> CFRP, and wrapped <b>with</b> three <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> CFRP. The experiment results show that the load-carrying capacity of the wrapped column increased by the increasing number <b>of</b> CFRP <b>layers.</b> Comparing the experimental results with the compressive strength concrete and the maximum load-carrying capacity of wrapped RC Column predicted by the theories proposed by several researchers with the concern of no-rounded corners were also presented. </p...|$|R

The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted {{at the time of the}} formal dedication on September 30, 1935—a crew of 500men remained to finish it and other structures.

5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.

5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D.

Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer.

On March 22, the crew filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported. A day later, Parker and the crew filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress each plant <b>with</b> <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed. The crew also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R.
