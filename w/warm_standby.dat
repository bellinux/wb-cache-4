50|$|Minimize standby latency {{and ensure}} standby correctness:Standby latency {{is defined as}} the time between when a standby is told to become active and when it is {{actually}} providing service. “Hot” standby systems are those that actively update internal state in response to active system checkpoints, resulting in millisecond down times. “Cold” standby systems are offline until the active fails and typically restart from a “baseline” state. For example, many cloud solutions will restart a virtual machine on another physical machine if the underlying physical machine fails. “Cold” fail over standby latency can range from 30+ seconds to several minutes. Finally, “warm” standby is an informal term encompassing all systems that are running yet must do some internal processing before becoming active. For example, a <b>warm</b> <b>standby</b> system might be handling low priority jobs - when the active fails it aborts these jobs and reads the active's checkpointed state before resuming service. <b>Warm</b> <b>standby</b> latencies depend on how much data is checkpointed but typically have a few seconds latency.|$|E
