5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E
5|$|Six more temples were {{discovered}} in the city, including the temple called the Massif Rouge (to <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dedicated is unknown), and temples dedicated for Ninni-Zaza, Ishtarat, Ishtar, Ninhursag and Shamash. All the temples were located {{in the center of}} the city except for the Ishtar temple and the area between the Enceinte Sacrée and the Massif Rouge is considered the administrative center of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the city, a royal palace was built which also served as a temple. Four {{successive}} architectural levels from the second kingdom's palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated P3, while the latest is P0), and the last two levels are dated to the Akkadian period. The first two levels were excavated; the findings include a temple named Enceinte Sacrée, which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dedicated. Also unearthed were a pillared throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} East Anglia was {{devastated by the}} Vikings, who {{destroyed}} any contemporary evidence of his reign. Later writers produced fictitious accounts of his life, asserting that {{he was born in}} 841, the son of Æthelweard, an obscure East Anglian king, <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said Edmund succeeded when he was fourteen (or alternatively that he was the youngest son of a Germanic king named 'Alcmund'). Later versions of Edmund's life relate that he was crowned on 25 December 855 at Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk), which at that time functioned as the royal capital, and that he became a model king.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the manor}} was {{passed on to}} William Dyer in 1444, who was a trustee of a lord named Robert Lee. Ownership was then {{transferred}} in 1485 to Maud, Anne, Elizabeth, Jane, and Ellen, daughters of John Lee, who had claimed {{the issues of the}} manor was under the will of their father, and complained that they had been prevented from enjoying them by Reginald Sandes and Robert Norton, who were also trustees. In 1567, William Lee sold the manor to Anne Twynne, and in 1591 Richard Miller sold it to Sir William of Kingswll. It was sold again in 1628 by Sir William's son and successor Edward Kingswell to Sir Richard Young of Weybridge, of <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> purchased in 1632 by Sir Humphrey Benett. Benett then compounded his estate in 1649, and sold the manor of Shalden in 1653 to Anne Mynne.|$|E
5|$|The player's character, the part-slug and {{part-cat}} Slugcat, uses {{spears and}} rocks {{to survive a}} hostile, ruined, and obtuse 2D world {{in search of the}} family from <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> separated. The player is given little explicit guidance and is free to explore the world in any direction via pipes and passages that pass through 1600 static screens, each with randomized enemies. The Slugcat can jump and use debris as weapons to avoid and hurt other creatures while foraging for sparse food, which is used to hibernate in scarce, designated safe rooms. Hibernation resets the day cycle and saves the player's progress. The player can move between regions by having the Slugcat hibernate multiple times without dying. If the player does not reach the hibernation point quickly, a crushing rain will pour, both flooding the world and possibly pummeling the Slugcat to death.|$|E

5|$|September 3rd – I {{went and}} saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – I went this morning on foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E
