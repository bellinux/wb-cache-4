5|$|Apt Pupil is a 1998 American thriller film {{directed}} by Bryan Singer and starring Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro. It {{is based on}} the 1982 novella of the same name by Stephen King. In the 1980s in southern California, high school student Todd Bowden (Renfro) discovers fugitive Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminal</b> Kurt Dussander (McKellen) living in his neighborhood under the pseudonym Arthur Denker. Bowden, obsessed with Nazism and acts of the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share his stories, and their relationship stirs malice in each of them.|$|E

25|$|<b>War</b> <b>criminals</b> prosecuted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were {{initially}} excluded from enshrinement after the war. Government authorities began considering their enshrinement, along with providing veterans' benefits to their survivors, following {{the signature of}} the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, and in 1954 directed some local memorial shrines to accept the enshrinement of <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> from their area. No convicted <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> were enshrined at Yasukuni until after the parole of the last remaining incarcerated <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> in 1958. The Health and Welfare Ministry began forwarding information on Class B and Class C <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> (those {{not involved in the}} planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of the war) to Yasukuni Shrine in 1959, and these individuals were gradually enshrined between 1959 and 1967, often without permission from surviving family members.|$|R
40|$|In 1953, the Australian {{government}} repatriated convicted Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> These {{were the}} last <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> held by the wartime allies {{to be returned to}} Japan. The Australian government's decision to repatriate <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> was made after a complex series of negotiations with other wartime allies and within the government itself. At play was the need to balance domestic opinion and the interests of the Australian government with a desire to have similar policies on <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> to those of key allies such as the United States. Moreover, after 1952, Japan and Australia entered a new era of diplomatic and economic relations, far removed from the immediate postwar years. Official sources reveal that the Australian government aimed {{to strike a balance between}} maintaining a tough stance on Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> and not hampering the emerging new era of foreign relations with Japan...|$|R

5|$|On 15 October 1944, Marinić filed {{charges against}} Pulherija and Gaudencija before the Land Commission for the Determination of Crimes by the Occupiers and Their Supporters. Pulherija fled to Austria {{before the end}} of the war, the only one of the nuns to do so. Gaudencija {{remained}} at the Children's Home, eventually moving to Ljubljana. No extradition of Pulherija was ever attempted, and neither nun was ever declared a <b>war</b> <b>criminal.</b> According to Fumić, the inhumane actions of Pulherija and other nuns and their role in the deaths of many children has never been condemned by the Catholic Church. Pulherija died in Austria in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a <b>war</b> <b>criminal,</b> he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E
5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that {{was responsible for}} the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a <b>war</b> <b>criminal</b> because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After he made his way to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
40|$|When Allied governments passed {{sentence}} on Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> from 1945 onwards, {{they expected}} that those convicted {{would stay in}} prison for their full terms. Within a comparatively short time, however, each government controlling Japanese war criminals’ sentences had granted them some form of clemency, {{and by the end}} of 1958, the last remaining <b>war</b> <b>criminals,</b> including those sentenced to life imprisonment, had been released with the agreement of the prosecuting governments. This article examines the ethical, political and pragmatic considerations that led to the granting of parole and clemency to convicted Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> between 1945 and 1958, the bureaucratic processes through which clemency was arranged, and the shifting political positions of the Japanese and Allied authorities in regard to <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> In so doing, it contributes to the extension of studies of war crimes justice to the post-sentencing phase, and highlights the role of the Japanese authorities and the Japanese public in determining the fate of <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> in the Pacific theatre of the war...|$|R
5000|$|The focus {{changed from}} the top wartime leaders to [...] "ordinary" [...] <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> (Class B and C in Japan), and an intense and broadly-supported {{campaign}} for amnesty for all imprisoned <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> ensued.

5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won {{the right}} to a pension {{following}} a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Living With a <b>War</b> <b>Criminal),</b> which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS <b>war</b> <b>criminal</b> Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was {{in sharp contrast to the}} party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{realized}} that Batista {{would lose the}} war, and fearing that Castro would displace U.S. interests with socialist reforms, decided to aid Batista's removal by supporting a rightist military junta, believing that General Cantillo, then commanding most of the country's armed forces, should lead it. After being approached with this proposal, Cantillo secretly met with Castro, agreeing that the two would call a ceasefire, following which Batista would be apprehended and tried as a <b>war</b> <b>criminal.</b> Double-crossing Castro, Cantillo warned Batista of the revolutionary's intentions. Wishing to avoid a tribunal, Batista resigned on 31 December 1958, informing the armed forces that they were now under Cantillo's control. With his family and closest advisers, Batista fled into exile to the Dominican Republic with over US$ 300,000,000. Cantillo then entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members of the government.|$|E

5|$|As UN {{air raids}} against the North Koreans intensified, Dean {{was moved to}} Sunan, north of P'yongyang, to a hut where he lived with several guards. They began daily interrogations {{primarily}} aimed at forcing military intelligence from him or making him sign a written condemnation of the UN intervention in Korea, but Dean adamantly refused to do so. Senior North Korean military leaders continued such interrogations through October 1950 but eventually gave up when Dean would not cooperate and was not intimidated by their threats. Dean continued to suffer from illness related to poor food {{but he was not}} given another interpreter and was not interrogated after October 1950. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Dean took to playing chess with his guards often and he was allowed to exercise daily. He was kept alone, however, and was never with other American prisoners for the remainder of his confinement. Dean later wrote extensively of his capture and imprisonment in his 1973 autobiography, General Dean's Story. He claimed the North Koreans considered him a <b>war</b> <b>criminal</b> and had many discussions with him about the problems with capitalism in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Japan's formal {{surrender}} in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto {{was promoted to}} his final rank of commander. On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas. Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a {{witness for the prosecution}} in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported from Tokyo to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or <b>war</b> <b>criminal,</b> but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front page news that day in the New York Times and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E
5|$|When Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil was {{published}} {{as part of}} his collection Different Seasons in 1982, producer Richard Kobritz optioned feature film rights to the novella. Kobritz met with actor James Mason to play the novella's <b>war</b> <b>criminal</b> Kurt Dussander, but Mason died in July 1984 before production {{as a result of a}} heart attack. The producer also approached Richard Burton for the role, but Burton also died in August that same year. By 1987 production on the film began with Nicol Williamson cast as Kurt Dussander, and 17-year-old Rick Schroder was cast as Todd Bowden. In that year, Alan Bridges began direction of the film with a script co-written by Ken Wheat and his brother Jim Wheat. After ten weeks of filming, the production suffered from a lack of funds from its production company Granat Releasing, and the film had to be placed on hold. Kubritz sought to revive production, but when the opportunity came a year later, Schroder had aged too considerably for the film to work. Forty minutes of usable footage was abandoned.|$|E
