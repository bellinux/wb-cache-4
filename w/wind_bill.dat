Working with a large and growing network of allies, the group has helped pass the Offshore <b>Wind</b> <b>Bill</b> in Maryland, {{one of the strongest}} statewide carbon caps in the country in Maryland, Clean Cars bills in Maryland and the District of Columbia, {{renewable}} energy standard bills in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Through litigation, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network has helped reduce mercury pollution from a coal power plant in Wise County, Virginia, by 94 percent. The organization was also instrumental in shutting down several of the region's coal plants and preventing the construction of new fossil fuel projects.|$|E

The storm was moving west-northwestward under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge to the north.

40|$|In April 2011, House Bill 347 was {{proposed}} in the Idaho legislation to extend the sales tax rebate for purchases of equipment used to generate electricity from alternative energy sources (i. e. <b>wind).</b> The <b>bill</b> unfortunately did not pass the Idaho State Senate and the rebate has expired. The premise of this research poster asks if the tax rebate was extended, what would the benefits and costs be for the following stakeholders: Idaho residents that live in proximity of wind farms, Idaho Power consumers, Idaho’s local municipalities, the Idaho state government, the Idaho economy and the environment. In order to quantify {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the proposed legislation, a simple cost-benefit analysis was used with a common metric of dollars. Conclusively, this analysis shows that the tax rebate would be beneficial for almost all of the stakeholders that are examined in this model, except Idaho Power 2 ̆ 7 s consumers.

50|$|The Chihuahuan raven (Corvus cryptoleucus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was {{formerly}} known as the American white-necked raven, and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (44 - 51 cm long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Australian raven, {{it is one of the}} smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, white-necked raven and brown-necked raven, with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other Corvus species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong <b>wind).</b> The <b>bill,</b> legs and feet are black.|$|R
5000|$|Until June 2017, Adams was Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Biomass Group and in 2013 {{he wrote}} an article {{describing}} the benefits of biomass.

Drax and Eggborough power stations are major UK electricity producers in his constituency. Both power stations are capable of burning biomass.

5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the <b>wind.</b> Chuck Burks (<b>Bill</b> Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|R
