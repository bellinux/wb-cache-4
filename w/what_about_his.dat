I don't think he ever wanted to avoid me. But {{it is a fact}} that he used to disappear out of the river in a very mysterious manner sometimes.

6000|$|Yes, {{the game}} was up, and she was glad, Grizel said to herself, {{as they made their}} melancholy pilgrimage of what had once been an enchanted land. But she felt that Tommy had been very forbearing to her, and that she did not deserve it. Undoubtedly he had ordered her about, but in so doing had he not been making half-pathetic sport of his old self--and was it with him that she was annoyed for ordering, or with herself for obeying? And why should she not obey, when it was all a jest? It was as if she still had some {{lingering}} fear of Tommy. Oh, she was ashamed of herself. She must say something nice to him at once. About <b>what?</b> <b>About</b> <b>his</b> book, of course. How base of her not to have done so already! but how good of him to have overlooked her silence on that great topic! ...|$|E

There will be--there must be--some brutalisation. But old soldiers are not usually inhumane--on the contrary, they are often very gentle beings. I distrust {{the influence of the}} war on those who merely write and read about it. I think editors, journalists, old gentlemen, and women will be brutalised in larger numbers than our soldiers. An intelligent French soldier said to me of his own countrymen: [...] "After six months of civil life, you won't know they ever had to 'clean up' trenches and that sort of thing." [...] If this is true of the Frenchman, it will be more true of the less impressionable Briton. If I must sum up at all on what, {{for want of a better}} word, I have called the [...] "spiritual" [...] count, I can only say that there will be a distinct increase of [...] "character," [...] and leave it to the reader to decide whether that falls on the debit or the credit side.|$|E
6000|$|High {{up in one}} of {{the topmost}} {{chambers}} of the Hotel Plaza, Nikasti, after his conference with Von Schwerin and Fischer, sought solitude. He opened the high windows, out of which he could scarcely see, dragged up a chest of drawers and perched himself, Oriental fashion, on the top, his long yellow fingers intertwined around his knees, his soft brown eyes gazing over the wooded slopes of the Park. He was away from the clamour of tongues, from the poisoned clouds of sophistry, even from the disturbance of his own thoughts, incited by specious arguments to some form of reciprocity. Here he sat in the clouds and searched for the true things. His eyes seemed to be travelling over the battlefields of Europe. He saw the swaying fortunes of mighty armies, he looked into council chambers, he seemed to feel the pulses of the great world force which kept going this most amazing Juggernaut. He saw the furnaces of Japan, blazing by night and day; saw the forms {{of hundreds of thousands of}} his fellow creatures bent to their task; saw the streams of ships leaving his ports, laden down with stores; saw the great guns speeding across Siberia, the endless trains of ammunition, the rifles, food for the famine-stricken giants who beat upon the air with empty fists. He saw the gold come streaming back. He saw it poured into the banks, the pockets of the merchants, the homes of his people. He saw brightening days throughout the land. He saw the slow but splendid strength of the nation rejoicing in its new possibilities. And beyond that, what? Wealth was the great means towards the great end, but if the great end were once lost sight of, there was no more hideous poison than that stream of enervating prosperity. He remembered his own diatribes concerning the decadence of England; how he had pointed to the gold poison, to the easy living of the poor, the blatant luxury of the rich. He had pointed to the soft limbs, the cities which had become pools of sensuality, to the daily life which, calling for no effort, had seen the passing of the spirit and the triumph of the gross. And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own people? Mankind was the same the world over. The gold which was bringing strength and life to the nation might very soon exude the same poisonous fumes, might very soon be laying its thrall upon a people to whom living had become an easier thing. However it might be for other, the Western nations, for his own he firmly believed that war alone, with its thousand privations, its call to the chivalry of his people, was the one great safeguard. China! The days had gone by when the taking of China could inspire. It was to greater things they must look. Australia. New Zealand! Had any Western race the right to flaunt her Empire's flag in Asiatic seas? And America! Once again he felt the slow rising of wrath as he recalled the insults of past years ... the adventurous sons of his country treated like savages and negroes by that uncultured, strong-limbed race of coarse-fibered, unimaginative materialists. There was a call, indeed, to the soul of his country to avenge, to make safe, the homes and lives of her colonists. Across the seas he looked into the council chambers of the wise men of his race. He saw the men whose word would tell. He watched their faces turned towards him, waiting; heard the beginning of the conflict of thoughts and minds--blind fidelity to the cause which they had espoused, or a rougher, more splendid, more selfish stroke for the greatness of Japan and Japan only. [...] "If we break our faith we lose our honour," [...] one murmured. [...] "There is no honour save the care of my people," [...] he heard one of his greatest countrymen reply.|$|E

There is a common myth that bad things can only done by people who are born bad and take sadistic pleasure in inflicting pain and suffering on others. It was thought that the innate evil qualities of Nazi war criminals would be indicated across the various psychological tests given them around the Nuremberg trials.
