5|$|Although {{the first}} {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities.

5|$|Aristotle Onassis's second {{marriage}} exacerbated the tensions already inherent in his relationship <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> He also disapproved of Alexander's secret relationship with Fiona Thyssen (née Campbell Walter), a British fashion model some 16 years his senior {{and the former}} wife of industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.

5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> One day, Naoyuki, while arguing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>son,</b> slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E
