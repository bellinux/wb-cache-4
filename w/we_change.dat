25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets {{are those that}} can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot {{be divided into two}} pieces that are far apart. The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If <b>we</b> <b>change</b> the definition of open set, <b>we</b> <b>change</b> what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice of definition for open set is called a topology. A set with a topology is called a topological space.|$|E

For while the problems facing higher education and the world are complex, the solutions need not be. Amidst the jostle and the fray and the haranguing static and noise that often surround our academic endeavor, stands our foundation: the simple gifts of the liberal arts. These profound gifts — the ability to act, to see, and to speak — are the bedrock that underpin teaching and learning at Wabash College.|$|E

Five years ago, it was much worse— we'd be {{choosing}} about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier— except that the race generally goes faster now, so we're under a bit more pressure. Every year, there's new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it's getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre {{we need to think}} of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame? ...|$|E

The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, <b>we</b> <b>change</b> with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|The 2003-04 {{comic book}} miniseries Wanted, by Mark Millar and J. G.

By 2004, producer Marc Platt had gotten the film rights, and lobbied the studio to get Russian-Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov, as Platt considered that the visual style and sensibility Bekmambetov showed in Night Watch and Day Watch [...] fit Wanted as “the comic is dark and edgy but it also has an ironic, comedic tone beneath its violent action”. In December 2005, Bekmambetov was hired to helm the project, his first English-language film, and writers Derek Haas and Michael Brandt were assigned the script. Bekmambetov described the original comic as [...] "risky and very provocative", with [...] "a twist and good characters", and declared that the thing that attracted him the most in Wanted was how it went through various film genres in its plot: [...] "It’s a comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a melodrama. Every scene, <b>we</b> <b>change</b> genres and that’s why our movie is different.” ...|$|E

500|$|Each journal {{covers a}} {{different}} period of Mountstuart's life, {{and they are}} usually geographically named: The School Journal, London I, etc. Boyd varied the narrator's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart's character. In the first London Journal he is, according to Boyd, a [...] "modernist aesthete", becoming a [...] "world-weary cynic" [...] in New York and finding [...] "serene and elegiac serenity" [...] in the final French journal. To support the book's historical themes and documentary premise, there is a feigned editorial apparatus: an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters, an editor's introduction (by Boyd), an authorial preface (by Mountstuart) {{and a list of}} works attributed to Mountstuart. An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor (Boyd), who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes, cross-references and attempts at dating. Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day, Mountstuart's moods change as events affect him. The form lends itself to [...] "plotlessness", since the author/narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story. Plot lines which [...] "fizzle and fade" [...] emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life. Boyd adds other aspects to the work, such as parenthetical musings that are never answered, to re-enforce the style. His tone of voice gradually changes as he ages: Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that <b>we</b> <b>change</b> and grow throughout life: [...] "I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes as you read on: from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent, to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic, to sage and serene octogenarian, and so forth." ...|$|E
