5|$|A Windows {{compatible}} Kinect 2.0 {{was released}} on July 15, 2014. Kinect 2.0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014; it is bundled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> copy of Dance Central Spotlight. The Kinect {{was the source of}} controversy due to the huge price of the system as a result of being bundled with the system. It was removed from the Xbox One bundle in May 2014 and production stopped entirely on October 25, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Captain America: The First Avenger was {{released}} on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and DVD on October 25, 2011. The three-disc set includes the film on Blu-ray in high-definition 3D and in high definition 2D, {{as well as on}} standard definition DVD <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> copy. The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack includes a high-definition presentation of the film and a standard-definition presentation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> copy. Both sets include over an hour of bonus material, including the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, a sneak peek of The Avengers, six behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes with commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson and editor Jeff Ford. In its first week of release, Captain America: The First Avenger topped the Blu-ray and DVD sales charts, selling 1.54 million Blu-ray units and 726,000 DVD units and making a combined total of $52.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Inside Man was {{director}} of photography Matthew Libatique's second film with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting), Libatique chose to shoot Inside Man in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses.|$|E

5|$|Streetly Electronics was {{subsequently}} reactivated by Les Bradley's son John and Martin Smith. After Les Bradley's death in 1997, {{they decided to}} resume full-time operation as a support and refurbishment business. By 2007, the stock of available instruments to repair and restore was diminishing, {{so they decided to}} build a new model, which became the M4000. The instrument combined the features of several previous models, and featured the layout and chassis of an M400 but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> bank selector that emulated the mechanical original in the Mk II.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E

5|$|Multi-scale {{camouflage}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} camouflage combining patterns at two or more scales, often (though not necessarily) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> camouflage pattern created with computer assistance. The function is to provide camouflage over a range of distances, or equivalently over a range of scales (scale-invariant camouflage), in the manner of fractals, so some approaches are called fractal camouflage. Not all multiscale patterns are composed of rectangular pixels, even if they were designed using a computer. Further, not all pixellated patterns work at different scales, so being pixellated or digital does not of itself guarantee improved performance.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk was {{released}} on Blu-ray and DVD on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening. The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> copy of the film. The Blu-ray edition compresses {{the content of the}} first two DVDs onto one, while the second disc contains the digital copy.|$|E

5|$|The {{challenges}} and quests {{were developed to}} keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E
5|$|Three albums were {{released}} by Hollywood Records on July 29, 2014: The film's score, Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score), which features the music composed by Bates for the film; , which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums. By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape {{had reached the}} top of the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart. Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to Record Store Day participants. The cassette, which is the first cassette Disney Music Group has released since 2003, comes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> download version of the album.|$|E
5|$|Vehicles also {{received}} digital enhancement. For {{the scene in}} which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL-215 amphibious plane into a cave, the effects team intended to use Miniature effects, filming using a 1/3 scale model of the 90-feet wing span plane. Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally. The plane itself was also digitally modified, adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil. A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design. A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves {{and so it was}} digitally removed entirely and replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> recreation that better fit the scene's requirements. The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added. WWFX later enhanced it more, modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight. The Sangs Mi-8 helicopter was a civilian variant, but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant, the Hip-E, to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme's villainous mercenary, with a black reflective coating and armaments. The T-72 tank used to assault the Expendables would have devastated the set with the resulting concussive wave if it had fired a single shot, so it was replaced in most shots <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> version that performed the shooting.|$|E

5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>digital</b> audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
