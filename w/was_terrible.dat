5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish and French land force {{continued}} to bombard Gibraltar, inflicting further {{damage on the}} town's somewhat weak fortifications but were unable to make any progress against the reinforced garrison. They were being vigorously opposed with counter-bombardments, which killed many of their number, and by sallies, two of which were carried out successfully by the confederates on 23 and 31 December. Relations steadily worsened between the Spanish and French components of the besieging force, a trend that was exacerbated {{by the lack of}} progress they were making, the appalling conditions they were enduring in the open and the steady stream of casualties being caused by the counter-bombardment and outbreaks of epidemic disease. The weather, too, <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> with storms and heavy rain making life a misery. By the New Year of 1705, the besieging force was disintegrating and had dropped in numbers from around 7,000 men to only 4,000, the remainder having either become casualties or simply deserting.|$|E

25|$|It {{was smaller}} than Bunce Court, so a group of the {{youngest}} children were sent temporarily to a school in Surrey. Even so, there <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> overcrowding and after a year, the chicken coop and the stables were converted into dormitories, creating enough room to allow the younger children to return. Even so, some bedrooms doubled as classrooms {{and had to be}} rearranged for use every morning. More time consuming, however, was having to cover every window in the evening to comply with the orders for a complete blackout, a task which had to be carried out for years.|$|E
25|$|L.T. Griffin was the zoo's first {{supervisor}} and in effect its first director. He went to Africa in 1923 to acquire species {{for the newly}} formed zoo. What followed was an aggressive policy of expansion {{over the next few}} years, including the zoo's first animal star, the female Indian elephant, Jamuna, whose influence is still seen today by Jamuna plaza {{in the rear of the}} modern zoo. The zoo originally had two keepers who worked seven-day weeks. The early mortality rate of animals in the zoo <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> especially considering modern standards. However, this was normal for the time.|$|E
25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers of the other side, the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Hughes {{told his}} aides {{that he wanted}} to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened {{screening}} room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk, and was surrounded by dozens of Kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> He had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to allodynia, which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighties}} NAC relegated two times. After the second relegation, it {{appeared}} the financial situation of NAC <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> NAC was almost bankrupt {{and had to}} sell its belongings to survive. For years NAC struggled to survive, {{but at the end}} of the eighties NAC’s situation improved and the club began to play in the top of the Eerste Divisie. On June 7, 1989, NAC player Andro Knel died in a plane accident. It was a shock to the club, especially since Knel was one of the popular players. Hundreds of fans of both NAC Breda and Sparta Rotterdam, Knel’s former club, came together in memorial of Knel. A temporary Knel monument was revealed and the numbers of supporters visiting the monument proved his popularity. Due to the sad moments of Knel's death a special relationship between fans of NAC and Sparta was created.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{reaction}} of some fans was dismay, {{as there were}} concerns that The Next Generation would continue to lift stories from The Original Series. Staff writer Maurice Hurley said of [...] "The Naked Now," [...] "I didn't like that show at all. It just wasn't very good. What it did show, though, was that the new ensemble could interact, {{and that there were}} relationships between them that worked. But doing it <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> It was a warmed over premise. Why do it?" [...] The liaison between Data and Yar stood out as being controversial, with Data referring to himself as being [...] "fully functional" [...] in a sexual sense.|$|E
500|$|Leuthen {{was not a}} big village. Troops were {{so closely}} packed they stood 30 to 100 ranks deep and the killing <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> Lamoral commented later that his battalion, usually some 1,000 strong, plus some Hungarians and some {{grenadiers}} who had been separated from their own companies, gave him almost (and only) 200 men. [...] He drew {{them back to the}} height {{at the edge of the}} village, where there was a windmill around which they could shelter. Eventually, though, the Prussian Life Guards, commanded by Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf, then a captain, broke through the village cemetery, and forced them to abandon their post.|$|E
500|$|Lord Sandwich 2, master William Author, sailed on 6 May 1776 from Portsmouth in a {{fleet of}} 100 vessels, 68 of which were transports, which was under orders to support Howe's {{campaign}} to capture New York.

The crossing <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> and two Hessians {{who were in the}} same fleet have left us accounts of the voyage. The scattered fleet assembled at Halifax and then sailed to Sandy Hook where other ships and troops assembled. On 15 August 1776 Lord Sandwich 2 was anchored at Sandy Hook; also assembled there was Adventure [...] (which had sailed with Resolution on Cook's second voyage), now a storeship, captain John Hallum.

500|$|After Harrison turned 18 and the {{immigration}} problems had been solved, the Beatles {{went back to}} Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club, playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961. To secure their return, Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities, which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter. Fellow musician, Tony Sheridan, later remembered the living conditions at the club: “John, George, Paul, Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn. We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks. It <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> really, now I look back. We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry. But we had great times and I’m afraid we used to tease {{the life out of}} the old lady who [...] us.” ...|$|E
500|$|This was Gazan's last field command. Gazan's pre-emptive {{withdrawal}} {{created a}} gap in French line, exposing D'Erlon's army in the center. D'Erlon held his position {{as long as he}} could, but the line collapsed around him. Joseph's planned orderly withdrawal turned into a rout. Gazan abandoned all his artillery. The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan's wife and children, although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, the plight of the French army <b>was</b> <b>terrible.</b> Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike [...] "were reduced to the clothes on their backs and most of them were barefoot," [...] but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease. When Soult took command of the new Army of the Pyrenees, Gazan became his chief of staff until Napoleon's abdication.|$|E

500|$|Money {{was very}} tight in Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility <b>was</b> <b>terrible!</b> Unless you were leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{video game}} journalists and enthusiasts {{including}} Thomas, Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack, GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer, and 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, {{refer to the}} fourth installment as {{a turning point for}} the quality of titles in the Mega Man series. Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game, likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System {{at the time of its}} release. Parrish proclaimed, [...] "Here's where the series starts to go off the rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out was silly, the music <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> the bosses and weapons were uninspired, and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game-breaking innovation." [...] Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless, one of the concepts that set the Mega Man games apart from other action-platformers.|$|E

[...] "I <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> and crazy nervous. I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd," [...] he told Rolling Stone several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis, and the remaining tour dates were postponed indefinitely. His manager, John Scher, informed Simon's camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, leading to poor relations between the two. Despite tensions, Simon continued to publicly wish his old friend Artie better health and gave him praises for his then angelic voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength {{over the course of the}} next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.|$|E
