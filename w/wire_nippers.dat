60|$|Once more, for the {{hundredth}} time, Emett {{came to our}} rescue with his inventive and mechanical skill. He took the largest pair of hobbles we had, and with an axe, a knife and Jones' <b>wire</b> <b>nippers,</b> fashioned two collars with swivels that for strength and serviceableness improved somewhat on those we had bought.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} cases of {{jaundice}} and many suffered from boils. Most {{of the party}} were suffering from stomach troubles, and the remainder from malaria; but nothing could he done for them as no medicines were available, except to make them comfortable. Their sickberth steward acted as doctor for the party, but with little equipment, {{he was forced to}} improvise. He used the blade of a safety razor for minor surgical operations, and extracted teeth with a pair of <b>wire</b> <b>nippers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to rock lath, there were {{various types of}} metal lath which is categorized according to weight, type of ribbing, and whether the lath is galvanized or not. Metal lathing was spaced across a 13.5 inch center, attached by tie <b>wires</b> using lathers' <b>nippers.</b> Sometimes, the mesh was dimpled to be self-furring.|$|R

A terrible {{bombardment}} shook the earth, the shells raining upon the ditches. Presently that from the English guns ceased and out of the trenches in front of them thousands of men were vomited, who ran forward through a hail of fire in which scores and hundreds fell, across an open piece of ground that was pitted with shell craters. They came to barbed wire defenses, or what remained of them, cut the <b>wire</b> with <b>nippers</b> and pulled up the posts. Then through the gaps they surged in, shouting and hurling hand grenades. They reached the German trenches, they leapt into them and from those holes arose a hellish din. Pistols were fired and everywhere bayonets flashed.|$|R
