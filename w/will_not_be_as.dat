5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> good and more errors will occur. This distortion {{can lead to a}} richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

25|$|When {{you take}} a tree that {{is rooted in the}} ground, and {{transfer}} it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit.

Adult Iriomote cats have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on tigers' ears.

25|$|The {{class has}} been criticised in Parliamentary {{evidence}} for: lacking a helicopter hangar (even a telescopic hangar), {{something that will}} limit utility of the helicopter deck by preventing embarkation of a helicopter for anything other than very short periods; lacking a medium calibre gun (such as 76mm); and poor value for money. It is argued {{that because of the}} lacking features (which could have been incorporated for the price) the vessels <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> capable in the ocean-going patrol capacity as claimed.|$|E
25|$|DirectX 12 was {{announced}} by Microsoft at GDC on March 20, 2014, and was officially launched alongside Windows 10 on July 29, 2015. DirectX 12 APIs are {{also expected to}} feature on the Xbox One and Windows Phone. The version of DirectX that runs on the Xbox One, DirectX 11.X, already includes {{a subset of the}} features in DirectX 12. However, the DirectX 12 code is not intended to be directly portable between PC and Xbox One due to inherent differences between the two platforms. Microsoft has stated that the performance improvements of DirectX 12 on the Xbox One <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> substantial as that on the PC.|$|E
25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E

2500|$|Relationship {{maintenance}} activities are {{a critical component}} to maintaining high quality relationships. [...] While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one {{may be in a}} skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted. [...] This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors. [...] As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.|$|E

In low scale disaster with few victims involved, immediate CPR is started {{in attempt to}} revive the vital signs. In larger events with more victims, the head is positioned to open the airway, the body is rolled onto its side and the responder will {{move on to the}} next victim. The positioning is done so if the body's vitals return, vomiting <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> likely to choke the victim. The bodies will not be collected until all surviving individuals have been removed from the immediate disaster area. There will be a body collection staging area set up away from any medical staging areas. Usually this will begin the recovery phase.|$|E

2500|$|The Garnaut Climate Change Review notes many {{barriers}} to increased global biosequestration. [...] "There must be {{changes in the}} accounting regimes for greenhouse gases. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions {{will need to be}} developed to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special efforts will be required to unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries." [...] Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global emissions trading scheme because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations. Collett likewise maintains that REDD credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their deforestation rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex market approach to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{component}} of the patriotic sentiment is the religious note the play often strikes. On the whole, everything Catholic is represented as bad, everything Protestant is represented as good: [...] "The play's popularity [...] has to be {{seen against the backdrop}} of an extraordinary efflorescence of interest in political history {{in the last two decades}} of the sixteenth century fed by self-conscious patriotic Protestantism's fascination with its own biography in history. It is not for nothing that Part One is persistently anti-Catholic in a number of ways despite the fact that in the fifteenth century the entire population of England was nominally Catholic (though not, of course, in 1592). The French are presented as decadently Catholic, the English (with the exception of the Bishop of Winchester) as attractively Protestant." [...] Talbot himself is an element of this, insofar as his [...] "rhetoric is correspondingly Protestant. His biblical references are all from the Old Testament (a source less fully used by Catholics) and speak of stoicism and individual faith." [...] Henry V is also cited as an example of Protestant purity: [...] "He was a king blest of the King of Kings./Unto the French the dreadful judgement day/So dreadful <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> was his sight./The battles of the Lords of Hosts he fought" [...] (1.1.28–31). [...] "King of kings" [...] is a phrase used in 1 Timothy, 6:15. [...] "Lords of Hosts" [...] is used throughout the Old Testament, and to say Henry fought for the Lord of Hosts is to compare him to the warrior king, David, who also fought for the Lords of Hosts in 1 Samuel, 25:28.|$|E
