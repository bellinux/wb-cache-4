5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to {{cause it to}} dissipate on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north of}} Bermuda. Located over warm <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler <b>waters,</b> <b>and</b> became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for about 18hours. On November21, a cold front {{moving through the}} Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast. The combination of cooler <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> wind shear from the front weakened Kate to an intensity of 100mph (160km/h) by the time the hurricane struck Crooked Island near Mexico Beach, Florida late on November21. After landfall, Kate continued to the northeast, crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm. Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November22. Encountering even colder <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> continued shear, the storm weakened further while turning to the east-southeast. On November23, Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda, terminating at 1800UTC that day.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy in South Africa, {{and the capacity}} constraints and restrictions of both resources, {{have led to a}} rapid increase in their cost. The manufacturing industry remains South Africa’s third-largest consumer of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> second- largest consumer of national energy. The improvement of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important theme for both organisational success and national economic sustainability. This paper presents the ‘lean based <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy stream mapping framework’ developed for the manufacturing industry, with the specific objective of decreasing its <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy intensity. As with the traditional value stream mapping tool, the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy stream mapping focuses on eliminating water- and energy-specific wastes within a process. <b>Water</b> <b>and</b> energy waste categories that will be used in conjunction with the framework will also be discussed. The key objective {{of this paper is to}} detail the process of creating the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy stream mapping, and the statistical forecasting methodology used to develop the baseline <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy demand data. The outcome of the implementation of the framework is the future state <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy stream mapping, which is effectively a blueprint for increased <b>water</b> <b>and</b> energy efficiency within a studied process...|$|R

5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} coolers <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> began to deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} {{and the associated}} convection started weakening. Increasingly colder <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into a swirl of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|E
