40|$|Abstract — Nowadays special {{attention}} should {{be paid to the}} management of all costs more than ever. All managers take intensive actions to this purpose, {{no matter what kind of}} organization they lead, making efforts to reduce the cost level to the lowest limit. Major decreases have been recorded in the industry of car service as far as the volume of activities is concerned, and implicitly the level of incomes in the field of car sales, spare parts and services. There are several questions we are trying to answer at the end of this study? o <b>Which</b> expenses <b>should</b> we completely give up? o <b>Which</b> expenses <b>should</b> we reduce? o <b>Which</b> expenses <b>should</b> we maintain? o <b>Which</b> directions <b>should</b> we invest to despite the economical crisis...|$|R

5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, <b>which</b> <b>should</b> take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, <b>which</b> <b>should</b> take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled {{down the side of}} the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E

Using different setups Hoek actually obtained a null result, confirming Fresnel's dragging coefficient.

5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, <b>which</b> <b>should</b> rarely be restricted.|$|E
