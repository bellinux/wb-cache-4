5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E

5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining the <b>whole</b> <b>body.</b> Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (goodness), Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> and nourish it.|$|E

5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used {{due to its}} apparent effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn.

5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E

30|$|As stated earlier, {{this study}} {{was a matter of}} {{reconnaissance}} and discovery related {{to the question of whether}} Se would be found in the <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of fish throughout the Fountain Creek watershed and if so, to what extent was the accumulation? (However, not anticipated was finding mercury in all fish). Our initial plan was to collect, as much as possible, a single fish species from 14 sites for comparisons of contamination by site, or at least, comparison of stream segments; however, collecting a single species was not possible because upper Fountain and Monument Creeks begin as cold water streams with markedly different assemblages of fish. Therefore, this report will focus on baseline data for selenium and mercury in the tissues of brown trout, a cold-water species and five warm-water species plus an initial study on the localization of Se and Hg in four selected tissues including the ovaries. We were not able to subject the data to rigorous statistical analysis but we were able to indicate trends of tissue-Se and tissue-Hg in fish <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> and selected tissues. We used regression analysis to determine whether a direct or inverse relationship existed between concentrations of Se and Hg in the <b>whole</b> <b>bodies</b> of fish at the 14 sites.|$|R

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v.

5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
