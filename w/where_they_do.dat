5|$|Importation or {{classical}} {{biological control}} involves {{the introduction of}} a pest's natural enemies to a new locale <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} {{has nine}} subspecies, although {{the differences are}} small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in morphology, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern S. c. carolinensis has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls {{of the three groups}} differ, as described above. The Great Basin and Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not seem to mix.|$|E

5|$|A 1998 {{estimate}} {{suggests the}} total annual worldwide consumption of Boletus edulis and {{closely related species}} (B.aereus, B.pinophilus, and B.reticulatus) to be between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it {{does not account for}} informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the wholesale price to over $200 per kilogram.|$|E

25|$|Aminoallyl NTPs {{are used}} for {{indirect}} DNA labeling in PCR, nick translation, primer extensions and cDNA synthesis. These labeled NTPs are helpful because of their application in molecular biology labs <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not {{have the capacity to}} handle radioactive material. For example, 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-Uridine(AA-UTPs) are more effective for high density labeling of DNA than pre-labeling the DNA. After the enzymatic addition of the NTPs, amine reactant fluorescent dyes can be added for detection of the DNA molecule. When incorporated into DNA or RNA molecules by DNA/RNA polymerase, 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP provide a reactive group for the addition of other chemical groups. Thus aminoallyl modified DNA or RNA can be labeled with any compound which has an amine-reactive group.|$|E
25|$|A {{person can}} have a high {{self-esteem}} and hold it confidently <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not need reassurance from others to maintain their positive self view, whereas others with defensive, high self-esteem may still report positive self-evaluations on the Rosenberg Scale, as all high self-esteem individuals do; however, their positive self-views are fragile and vulnerable to criticism. Defensive high self-esteem individuals internalize subconscious self-doubts and insecurities, causing them to react very negatively to any criticism they may receive. There {{is a need for}} constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth. The necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful, arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual's self-worth, an example of threatened egotism.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they feel that this is the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E
