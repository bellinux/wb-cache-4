40|$|Introduction: Food-borne {{pathogens}} are {{causes of}} poisoning and gastrointestinal infections. In recent years, {{it is recommended}} to use natural materials like plant extracts and essences instead of chemical preservatives in food industry. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to identify the phenolic compounds of ethanolic <b>walnut</b> <b>kernel</b> and its antimicrobial effect on some food-borne pathogens. Methods: In this experimental study, after collection of <b>walnut</b> <b>kernel,</b> its ethanolic extract was prepared. Then its antimicrobial activity on salmonella typhimurium, shigella disentriae, listeria monocytogenes was examined as Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) using microdilution method. Chloramphenicol (30 µg) was used as the reference antimicrobial agent. Total phenols, flavonoids and flavonols were also determined by colorimetric method. Results: The results showed that MIC was between 0. 625 and 1. 25 mg/ml and MBC was between 1. 25 and 2. 5 mg/ml for ethanolic extract. Total phenols were 365 ± 14. 71 mg/g gallic acid equivalent, and total flavonoids and flavonols were 285 ± 12. 25 and 132 ± 1. 63 mg/g rutin equivalent, respectively.

40|$|The {{content of}} walnut {{metabolites}} {{is related to}} its nutritive value and physiological characteristics, however, comprehensive information concerning the metabolome of walnut kernels is limited. In this study we analyzed the metabolites of walnut kernels at five developmental stages from filling to ripening using GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics; of a total 252 peaks identified, 85 metabolites were positively identified. Further statistical analysis revealed that these 85 metabolites covered different types of metabolism pathways.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{research}} was conducted to provide a theoretical basis and experimental {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that insect larvae can be preferentially heated in dry nuts and fruits by radio frequency (RF) heating for pest control. We selected codling moth larvae as the target insect and in–shell walnuts as the host material for this study, and focused our attention on one RF frequency (27 MHz) and one microwave frequency (915 MHz). Dielectric properties measurements showed that the loss factor ratio between codling moth larvae and <b>walnut</b> <b>kernels</b> at 20 C was 397 at 27 MHz and 4 at 915 MHz. The theoretical prediction for a 3 min treatment at 0. 27 kW/kg suggested 12. 0 C preferential heating of insect larvae for the loss factor ratio of 397 (corresponding to 27 MHz) and 0. 1 C for the ratio of 4 (corresponding to 915 MHz), when the heat transfer coefficient between insects and walnuts was set at 500 W/m 2 C. To prove differential heating predicted by the theoretical model, a gellan gel with dielectric properties similar to those of insects was used as a model insect. When <b>walnut</b> <b>kernels</b> were heated at 27 MHz from 20 C to 53 C, the model insects were differentially heated from 12. 6 C to 21. 2 C higher than the kernel temperature, depending on the power used and the treatment time. These values corresponded to a heating rate for the model insect of 1. 4 to 1. 7 times greater than that for <b>walnut</b> <b>kernels.</b> As predicted by the theoretical model, microwave heating at 915 MHz caused no differential heating of insects.

The overall assessment scores of the Tasmanian walnuts was 73 (out of 100) compared to 65 for walnuts grown in Canterbury. While most of the attributes between the two groups of nuts were similar, the overall crackout score of the Tasmanian nuts received a perfect score of 20 while the Canterbury walnuts scored a mean of 14 for all of the six cultivars. The two groups of walnuts were then subjected to organoleptic assessment using 59 untrained tasters. The tasters recorded their impressions of the taste and after taste of all the nuts using a five point hedonic scale. The overall taste and after taste scores for the Tasmanian and Canterbury walnuts were very similar but individual cultivars Earnscleugh, Vina and Fernette achieved higher scores for taste when compared with all of the other cultivars evaluated while Fernette grown in Tasmania was given the highest overall score for the attribute after taste. Overall the cultivar Fernette grown in Tasmania had the best mean scores for both taste (3. 5) and after taste (3. 5) which were significantly greater than all of the other cultivars. All the walnuts were subjected to general proximate analysis, individual fatty acid analysis, tocopherol and phytosterol profile, and total and free phenolic analysis.

[...] In turn, the boatmen themselves referred to the Dan as the [...] "Black River", emphasizing the bandit problem.At that time, three relatively large families controlled shipping; those of Ling Laosi (凌老四) from Jingziguan Town (荆紫关镇)，Guo Laopo (郭老婆) from Laocheng Town (老城镇) and Liguanqiao Town's (李官桥镇) Jin Yulou (金玉楼), head of the Red Guild (红帮会). They were all considered leeches and exploiters by the boatmen. Records show that cargoes carried on the Dan River included kerosene, tobacco, chinaware, silk, medicinal ingredients, <b>walnuts,</b> peach <b>kernels</b> (used in Chinese medicine) and specialty products from the mountains.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of the moisture content, loading velocity and compression position on the force, specific deformation, absorbed energy and required power to achieve the initial rupture of the walnut shell. Iran is the third walnut producing country in the world. Separation of <b>walnut</b> <b>kernel</b> from the shell is a very time consuming and costly task. A proper cracking machine for walnut has not yet been manufactured. It seems that the determination of mechanical properties of different walnut varieties is the pre-requisite step for this purpose. Thus, 108 local walnut samples, (a local cultivar) obtained from the seedling trees of Urmia district, with almost equal dimensions were selected. These samples were compression loaded by an Instron test machine until the shell rupture was initiated. During this experiment, rupture force, specific deformation, required energy and power for shell rupture, in 9, 21 and 27 % (w. b.) walnut moisture levels, 50, 200 and 500 mm min - 1 loading velocities and at 3 major compression directions namely, length (X), suture (Z) and width (Y), were determined. The results of this experiment indicated that, the highest force, energy and power values, required for walnut rupture, occur when the force is applied at the length direction of the fruit and the lowest of these values were required at either width or suture line. Specific deformation of walnut shell increased with increasing loading velocity, regardless of its moisture content and loading direction. Furthermore, moisture content of walnut shell increased the specific deformation for 21 % moisture, but did not cause further changes at the higher level of 27 % of moisture. However, the strain values (specific deformation) appeared to be the same at all loading position. Increasing the loading velocity, although increased the required rupture energy and power, but reduced the fracture force. Furthermore, in higher loading velocities (about 500 mm min - 1), the specific deformation increased which indicates more flexibility in walnut shell. Flexible shell may protect the fruit against fracture in the walnut cracking process...|$|E
50|$|Fruit pit carving (simplied Chinese:果核雕刻; {{traditional}} Chinese：果核雕刻; pinyin： guǒhédiāokè) is a Chinese folk handicraft {{in which}} the pits of peach, apricot, olive, Myrica rubra <b>kernels,</b> <b>walnuts,</b> and others are used to create minute patterns of the Buddha, nature, or the Chinese zodiac that are said to repel evil spirits. The carved pits are also used to create jewelry and decorations. Olive core carving has recently been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritage in Guangdong Province, China. However, the art is now facing extinction because few black olive trees are planted in China and {{there are very few}} people interested in learning this art.|$|R
30|$|In this study, to our {{knowledge}} the application of bio materials as a potential viscosity reduction agent for crude oil were reported first time. Four types of materials were used: palm tree fiber, <b>walnut</b> shell and <b>kernel</b> of dates (roasted and unroasted). Each material was washed thoroughly with water, dried using hot air oven at 60  °C, and then grounded. The grounded bio material was sieved to obtain powder with two different particle sizes; 75 and 150  µm. Each bio material was used in amount of 10, 20 and 100 ppm crude oil. These bio materials and crude oil were thoroughly mixed using digital magnetic stirrer. Each material was soaked in crude oil for 24  h before the experiment. The work was conducted at a temperature of 22  °C.|$|R
40|$|Navel orangeworrns, Amyelois transitella (Walker), {{completed}} {{development in}} sunburned walnuts {{late in the}} growing season, but moths did not emerge until after harvest. Sunburned walnuts were not attractive to ovipositing moths until considerable hull damage occurred. Only sunburned <b>walnuts</b> with undamaged <b>kernels</b> were suitable for larval development. Navel orangeworrn infestation levels up to 38 % were recorded in sunburned walnut samples from the San Joaquin Valley, CA. Nut hull tissue damaged by sunburn was not selected over undamaged hull tissue for moth oviposition. Mean kernel temperatures of sunburned walnuts were higher than both undamaged walnuts and ambient air temperature. Premature hullsplit occurred in sunburned walnuts of both early and later maturity varieties. These data suggest that, although sunburned walnuts contribute to the seasonal buildup of navel orangeworms, the late development of navel orangeworms in these nuts reduces the incidence of infestation in hullsplit, new crop nuts...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} conducted in native walnut population during 2003 - 2004 years in Bitlis, 17 <b>walnut</b> genotypes having <b>kernel</b> weight over 5 g were selected and pomologically defined.

The kernel fullness of all genotypes except for one was good, kernel rottenness was not run into all genotypes. In addition, kernel colors of genotypes were light, dark, yellow and extreme dark. Findings pointed out that Central Bitlis district had valuable walnut genetic resources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Walnut</b> and almond <b>kernels</b> {{are highly}} nutritious mainly {{due to their}} high oil contents. In this study, 32 {{factorial}} experimental designs were used to optimize processes for oil extraction by screw-pressing at industrial scale. Experimental designs included seed moisture content (SMC), and restriction die (RD) as the main processing parameters. Theoretical models were scanned against experimental data in order to optimize oil extraction conditions. The response variables analyzed were oil yield (OY), fine solid content (FC) in oil, and oil quality parameters. Fitted models for OY indicated maximum predicted values similar to the highest experimental values. Walnut oil extractions showed a maximum OY (84. 5 ± 2. 3 %) at 7. 21 % SMC, and 10 mm RD. For almond kernels, maximum OY (71. 9 ± 3. 5 %) was obtained at 9. 42 % SMC, and 12 mm RD. Chemical quality parameters from both oils were in the ranges stated in Codex (FAO/WHO) standards for virgin (non-refined) oils...|$|R
