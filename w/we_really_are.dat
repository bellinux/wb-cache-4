In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired us when we were growing up, people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E

[...] She has also stated to Interview that she identifies with polar bears because [...] "they're very cuddly and cute and quite calm, but if they meet you {{they can be very}} strong." [...] Freeze Frame wrote: [...] "She's is the hunter-gather [...] that we evolved from, still with us and still a part of us. It's about shedding the denial and embracing what we are - what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> even thought it's sometimes hard to tell."

2500|$|Chang is {{currently}} the Producing Artistic Director of Pan Asian Repertory Theatre, a theatre group that she established in 1977 to help the emergence of Asian American theater. [...] She has said that [...] "the extraordinary talent and dedication of the actors [...] inspired me to formalize the group into Pan Asian Repertory Theatre." [...] The money she earned from The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel, which she starred in that year, was used to fund the establishment. Chang's main principle with Pan Asian {{has always been to}} [...] "promote opportunities for Asian-American actors to be seen in context of who <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> and what we are capable of achieving as artists." [...] According to Chang, Asian Americans had difficulties finding roles in New York City before she established Pan Asian. They were usually limited to playing stereotypical Asian characters such as geisha girls and houseboys. It was easier to get roles in Los Angeles, where the East West Players theatre group had been founded in 1965. Many people in the theatre business doubted that Pan Asian would be successful and wondered if anyone would pay to come and see their plays. Chang has said that [...] "because we were considered a curiosity or something very new and unique, people did come." [...] TV Times wrote in 1981 that Pan Asian was [...] "the most respected experimental theatre group in New York City." [...] As of 2009, it is the world's largest producer of Asian American theatre.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, {{near the}} height of the dot com boom, The New York Times {{approached}} Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on [...] "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity." [...] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to [...] "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..." [...] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut {{in the midst of the}} slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, [...] "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen." [...] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, [...] "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels." [...] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as [...] "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>are</b> in effect speaking across the transom here." [...] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, [...] "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing." ...|$|E
