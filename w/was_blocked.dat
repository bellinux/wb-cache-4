50|$|Regardless of the {{anaesthetic}} agent (drug) used, {{the desired effect}} <b>is</b> to <b>block</b> the transmission of afferent nerve signals from peripheral nociceptors.

Thin unmyelinated C-fibres associated with pain <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> first, while thick, heavily myelinated A-alpha motor neurons <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> moderately. Heavily myelinated, small preganglionic sympathetic fibers <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> first. The desired result is total numbness of the area. A pressure sensation is permissible and often occurs due to incomplete blockade of the thicker A-beta mechanoreceptors. This allows surgical procedures to be performed with no painful sensation to the person undergoing the procedure.|$|R
