5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E

5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs {{from the head}} of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> raven, and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise no difference in plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now {{thought to have been}} an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E

5|$|In Neuer's debut for Newark, {{he allowed}} nine walks, eight runs, and made two errors; his {{pitching}} was noted as the direct {{cause of the}} 8–5 loss. By the beginning of June, Newark returned him to New York; in his short time in the Eastern League, Neuer set the record for most strikeouts in a game and most walks in a game, with 13 each. Griffith sent him back to Newark almost immediately, and they in turn {{sent him to the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, who in turn released him. He then signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and pitched for them before being released on August 1.|$|E

5|$|Outside, Madonna rummages debris, {{tries to}} make a phone-call from a payphone, gets frustrated, and starts smashing objects {{in front of her}} with the rod. Her actions catches the {{attention}} of a man, played by Howard. He picks up his sniper rifle to shoot at the object of disturbance, but seeing Madonna through the lens, runs after her. They meet each other at a destroyed building where both of them notice each other and circle around with weapons in their hand. They come close and instead of attacking they throw away the weapons, embrace each other and engage in a dance-routine. After they complete their dance, and the song ends, the couple notice a little boy watching them from the destroyed building. The video ends with the couple leaving the city <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> boy hand-in-hand together with a large dog, and a panorama of the destruction.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven can {{be found}} in a wide range of natural and {{modified}} habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include eucalypt-dominated sclerophyll forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia, the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas. Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vie for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there. It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from Port Stephens northwards. The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common corvid in Canberra, Sydney and Perth; in Melbourne and Adelaide it is replaced by the little raven, and by the Torresian crow in Brisbane. Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and shield bugs (Pentatomidae), beetles such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm Pandanus spiralis.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E
