5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to <b>wait</b> <b>it</b> out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E

After a long <b>wait,</b> <b>it</b> was restored and has been operating on Lake Minnetonka from 1996 to 2004 by the Minnesota Transportation Museum and since then by the Museum of Lake Minnetonka.

500|$|Jefferies {{has since}} given {{his account of}} what happened, and {{revealed}} to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: [...] "At the time {{it felt as if}} the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the <b>wait.</b> <b>It</b> was a form of psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She laughs at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly written show. Oh <b>wait,</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|E
500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to <b>wait</b> <b>it</b> out and see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the studio}} version, {{released}} on A Moon Shaped Pool, were also mostly positive. Rolling Stone and Arizona Republic named [...] "True Love Waits" [...] the best song of May 2016; Arizona Republic critic Ed Masley {{wrote that the}} new arrangement [...] "heightens the sense of desperate yearning in Yorke's vocal as he begs his lover not to leave." [...] Pitchfork named it the week's best new track, with critic Jillian Mapes writing: [...] "You don't throw true love away. You don't walk out. People who mean this much to each other <b>wait</b> <b>it</b> out, they fight. We should be grateful that Yorke {{did the same with}} 'True Love Waits'." [...] In December 2016, Pitchfork placed the song #9 in its list of the best songs of the year; critic Nathan Reese wrote: [...] "'True Love Waits' is an elegiac coda to one of Radiohead's most inward-facing albums and a fitting treatment to a song that many already considered a classic. The wait was worth it." ...|$|E

[...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much.

2500|$|If {{something}} {{were not}} done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and preempt Leno. Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno {{to a few}} nights per week. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of The Jay Leno Show, moving their [...] "10 at 10" [...] segment to later in the broadcast. Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working {{on a plan to}} cut The Jay Leno Show to a half-hour, leading into Conan's Tonight Show around midnight. The biggest calamity in this scenario would be Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, which would get bumped to 1am. The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35 (this plan would effectively cancel Late Night). Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to <b>wait</b> <b>it</b> out for the new year, as to not [...] "ruin anybody's holiday season".|$|E
