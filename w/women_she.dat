5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the <b>women</b> <b>she</b> counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the <b>women</b> <b>she</b> had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the <b>women</b> <b>she</b> counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

If she is a sleepy <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> is probably dreaming by this time, and may not discover until morning that her lord and master is not by her side. If she is a bad-tempered <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> will probably lie for an hour or two, thinking over what she shall say to him when he comes in. If she is a nervous <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> will get up and go downstairs.|$|R
