"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Therefore <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> at page 25 of [...] "Progress and Poverty" [...] must be {{regarded}} as a welcome lapse into clearness of apprehension:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take a look}} {{at those}} hills across the river first," [...] said I, [...] "and see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find.</b> I am still {{doubtful}} about variations. I have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole." ...|$|E
60|$|It is a crisis, gentlemen; {{and time}} to think of it. I have roughly and broadly put it before you in its darkness. Let us look <b>what</b> <b>we</b> may <b>find</b> of light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something gay? There {{is nothing}} very gay in this solemn old Louvre. But <b>we</b> will see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can <b>find.</b> You speak French to-day like a charm. My father has done wonders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What HAVE we found?' cried Wegg, {{delighted to}} be able to acquiesce. 'Ah! There I grant you, comrade. Nothing. But on the contrary, comrade, <b>what</b> MAY <b>we</b> <b>find?</b> There you'll grant me. Anything.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{this case}} {{as in the}} other {{we expect them to}} {{understand}} at once, without instruction, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> it extremely difficult to learn ourselves; for a large portion of mankind prove themselves utterly unable ever to discriminate between sound arguments and those which are utterly inconsequent and absurd.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Mr. Dusterdeevil, we will divide equally <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find,</b> like {{brother and}} brother. Now, {{look at this}} board that I just flung into the dark aisle out o' the way, while Monkbarns was glowering ower a' the silver yonder. He's a sharp chiel Monkbarns--I was glad to keep the like o' this out o' his sight. Ye'll maybe can read the {{character}} better than me--I am nae that book learned, at least I'm no that muckle in practice." ...|$|E
6000|$|And this tallies {{with the}} whole strain of his character. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> everywhere, with an {{abundant}} use {{of the name of}} God, is the conception of a formless Infinite whether in time or space; of a high inscrutable Necessity, which it is the chief wisdom and virtue to submit to, which is the mysterious impersonal base of all Existence,--shows itself in the laws of every separate being's nature; and for man in the shape of duty. On the other hand, I affirm, we do know whence we come and whither we go!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{sure you}} would never guess {{in a hundred years}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did <b>find.</b> You see that stain on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{must all}} eat something,” {{declared}} Patsy, “else you won’t be fit {{to continue the}} search. Go to the library—all of you—and Beth and I will see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> in the kitchen.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't likely. You see, it snows up hyar. Mebbe we'll be snowed in fer a spell. An' thet {{valley is}} open down thar. In deep snow <b>what</b> could <b>we</b> <b>find?</b> We'll wait an' see." ...|$|R
60|$|Recollect what I said in {{my first}} paper: that water drops its pebbles and coarser {{particles}} first, while it carries the fine clayey mud onward in solution, and only drops it when the water becomes still. Now currents of such tremendous violence as to carry these boulder stones onward, would have carried the mud for many miles farther still; and we should find the boulders, not in clay, but lying loose together, probably on a hard rock bottom, scoured clean by the current. That is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> in the beds of streams; that is just what we do not find in this case.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{is there}} any better {{foundation}} for Mr. Seeley's somewhat peremptory assertion that previous writers all miss what he considers the true point in our history during the eighteenth century. It is simply contrary to fact to assert that 'they do not perceive that in that century the history of England is not in England, but in America and Asia.' Mr. Green, for instance, was not strong in his grasp of the eighteenth century, and that period is in many respects an extremely unsatisfactory part of his work. Yet if we turn to his History of the English People, this is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> at the very outset of the section that deals with modern England:-- ...|$|E
60|$|And it is observable, {{that before}} this clause {{was put into}} this commission, Peter was pardoned his horrible revolt from his Master. He that revolteth in the day of trial, {{if he is not}} shot quite dead upon the place, but is {{sensible}} of his wound, and calls out for a surgeon, shall find his Lord at hand to pour wine and oil into his wounds, that he may again be healed, and to encourage him to think that there may be mercy for him: besides <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> recorded of Peter, you read in the Acts, some were, through the violence of their trials, compelled to blaspheme, and yet are called saints; Acts xxvi. 9-11.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma foi," [...] {{answered}} the man, shrugging his shoulders, [...] "we were in rags. The commissariat was demoralised, and supplies were not forthcoming. We {{had to take}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could <b>find,</b> or else go naked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Bobby, you can trot along home, and I hope {{all that}} green corn you have eaten {{will not give}} you the stomach ache. To-morrow <b>we</b> will see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> out about Buster Bear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! Do as you like," [...] he replied, with {{affected}} carelessness; [...] "only I thought, as {{we cannot}} {{afford to go}} elsewhere this Christmas, it might be well {{for us to take}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could <b>find</b> here." ...|$|R
60|$|I placed {{before you}} in a few words, some little time ago, a {{statement}} of the sum and substance of Milton's hypothesis. Let me now try to state as briefly, the effect of the circumstantial evidence bearing upon the past history of the earth which is furnished, without the possibility of mistake, with no chance of error as to its chief features, by the stratified rocks. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> is, that the great series of formations represents a period of time of which our human chronologies hardly afford us a unit of measure. I will not pretend to say how we ought to estimate this time, in millions or in billions of years. For my purpose, the determination of its absolute duration is wholly unessential. But that the time was enormous there can be no question.|$|E
60|$|When we {{impose a}} proper name, we perform an {{operation}} in some degree analogous {{to what the}} robber intended in chalking the house. We put a mark, not indeed upon the object itself, but, so to speak, upon {{the idea of the}} object. A proper name is but an unmeaning mark which we connect in our minds with the idea of the object, in order that whenever the mark meets our eyes or occurs to our thoughts, we may think of that individual object. Not being attached to the thing itself, it does not, like the chalk, enable us to distinguish the object when we see it; but it enables us to distinguish it when it is spoken of, either in the records of our own experience, or in the discourse of others; to know that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> asserted in any proposition of which it is the subject, is asserted of the individual thing with which we were previously acquainted.|$|E
60|$|I {{have heard}} it represented, that if the Light of a Candle be refracted by a Prism to the Eye; when the blue Colour falls upon the Eye, the Spectator shall see red in the Prism, and when the red falls upon the Eye he shall see blue; and if this were certain, the Colours of the Globe and Rain-bow ought to appear in a {{contrary}} order to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find.</b> But the Colours of the Candle being very faint, the mistake seems to arise from the difficulty of discerning what Colours fall on the Eye. For, on the contrary, I have sometimes had occasion to observe in the Sun's Light refracted by a Prism, that the Spectator always sees that Colour in the Prism which falls upon his Eye. And the same I have found true also in Candle-light. For when the Prism is moved slowly from the Line which is drawn directly from the Candle to the Eye, the red appears first in the Prism and then the blue, and therefore each of them is seen when it falls upon the Eye. For the red passes over the Eye first, and then the blue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> do <b>we</b> <b>find?</b> As {{soon as we}} get {{a whisper}} of civilization in Greece, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> Dædalus {{successful}} in flying. The pragmatic interpreters pretend that the fable does but point to the discovery of sails for ships; but I put it to you, is that probable?" ...|$|R

"The Lord knows <b>what</b> <b>we</b> may <b>find,</b> dear lass, [...] And the deuce knows <b>what</b> <b>we</b> may do-- [...] But we're {{back once}} {{more on the}} old trail, our own trail, the [...] out trail, [...] We're down, hull down on the Old Trail--the trail that is always new." ...|$|R

60|$|Even {{where men}} were not sacrificed to the gods, the tourist among the temples would learn that these bloody rites {{had once been}} customary, and ceremonies existed by way of commutation. This is {{precisely}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> in Vedic religion, in which the empty form of sacrificing a man was gone through, and {{the origin of the}} world was traced to the fragments of a god sacrificed by gods.(1) In Sparta was an altar of Artemis Orthia, and a wooden image of great rudeness and antiquity--so rude indeed, that Pausanias, though accustomed to Greek fetish-stones, thought it must be of barbaric origin. The story was that certain people of different towns, when sacrificing at the altar, were seized with frenzy and slew each other. The oracle commanded that the altar should be sprinkled with human blood. Men were therefore chosen by lot to be sacrificed till Lycurgus commuted the offering, and sprinkled the altar with the blood of boys who were flogged before the goddess. The priestess holds the statue of the goddess during the flogging, and if any of the boys are but lightly scourged, the image becomes too heavy for her to bear.|$|E
60|$|Whether a thing {{be wrong}} or right, guilt may pursue him that doth {{contrary}} to his conscience. But suppose {{a man should}} deny his God, or his Christ, or relinquish a good profession, and be under the real guilt thereof, shall he, therefore, conclude he is gone for ever? Let him come again with Peter's tears, and no doubt but he shall obtain Peter's forgiveness; for the text includes the biggest sinners. And it is observable, that before this clause was put into this commission, Peter was pardoned his horrible revolt from his Master. He that revolteth in the day of trial, {{if he is not}} shot quite dead upon the place, but is sensible of his wound, and calls out for a chirurgeon, shall find his Lord at hand to pour wine and oil into his wounds, that he may again be healed, and to encourage him to think that there may be mercy for him; besides <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> recorded of Peter, you read in the Acts, some were, through the violence of their trials, compelled to blaspheme, and yet are called saints (Acts 26:9-11).|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray allow me," [...] {{said the}} stranger, {{approaching}} a step nearer, and laying his gloved {{hand on my}} sleeve. [...] "One other favor I must ask of you. You have a young person here at Blithedale, of whom I have heard,--whom, perhaps, I have known,--and in whom, at all events, I take a peculiar interest. She {{is one of those}} delicate, nervous young creatures, not uncommon in New England, and whom I suppose to have become <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> them by the gradual refining away of the physical system among your women. Some philosophers choose to glorify this habit of body by terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather the effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of outdoor exercise, and neglect of bathing, on the part of these damsels and their female progenitors, all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia. Zenobia, even with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality, is far the better model of womanhood. But--to revert again to this young person--she goes among you by the name of Priscilla. Could you possibly afford me the means of speaking with her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A fore-and-aft {{schooner}} in sight! Probably some trader. May be a schooner which I {{heard the}} French had brought for missionary purposes. <b>What</b> if <b>we</b> <b>find</b> a priest {{or two at}} Port Patteson! However, my course is clear any way: work straight on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you'll hear it, if you wake in time. Now get your hat, and <b>we</b> will see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> {{down by the}} brook.

6000|$|... "Can't {{understand}} it? Why, it's perfectly clear. This is {{the coincidence}} for which, in my capacity of Gridley Quayle, I was waiting. I can now resume inductive reasoning.

6000|$|Now this is {{the first}} {{weakness}} {{in the case of the}} Eugenists: that they cannot define who is to control whom; they cannot say by what authority they do these things. They cannot see the exception is different from the rule--even when it is misrule, even when it is an unruly rule. The sound sense in the old Lunacy Law was this: that you cannot deny that a man is a citizen until you are practically prepared to deny that he is a man. Men, and only men, can be the judges of whether he is a man. But any private club of prigs can be judges of whether he ought to be a citizen. When once we step down from that tall and splintered peak of pure insanity we step on to a tableland where one man is not so widely different from another. Outside the exception, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> is the average. And the practical, legal shape of the quarrel is this: that unless the normal men have the right to expel the abnormal, what particular sort of abnormal men have the right to expel the normal men? If sanity is not good enough, what is there that is saner than sanity? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{this reason}} greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies which {{assimilate}} {{the universe to}} Man. Knowledge {{is a form of}} union of Self and not-Self; like all union, it is impaired by dominion, and therefore by any attempt to force the universe into conformity with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> in ourselves. There is a widespread philosophical tendency towards the view which tells us that Man is the measure of all things, that truth is man-made, that space and time and the world of universals are properties of the mind, and that, if there be anything not created by the mind, it is unknowable and of no account for us. This view, if our previous discussions were correct, is untrue; but in addition to being untrue, it has the effect of robbing philosophic contemplation of all that gives it value, since it fetters contemplation to Self. What it calls knowledge is not a union with the not-Self, but a set of prejudices, habits, and desires, making an impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond. The man who finds pleasure in such a theory of knowledge is like the man who never leaves the domestic circle for fear his word might not be law.|$|E
60|$|What we {{have found}} as regards space {{is much the same}} as <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> in {{relation}} to the correspondence of the sense-data with their physical counterparts. If one object looks blue and another red, we may reasonably presume that there is some corresponding difference between the physical objects; if two objects both look blue, we may presume a corresponding similarity. But we cannot hope to be acquainted directly with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red. Science tells us that this quality is a certain sort of wave-motion, and this sounds familiar, because we think of wave-motions in the space we see. But the wave-motions must really be in physical space, with which we have no direct acquaintance; thus the real wave-motions have not that familiarity which we might have supposed them to have. And what holds for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data. Thus we find that, although the relations of physical objects have all sorts of knowable properties, derived from their correspondence with the relations of sense-data, the physical objects themselves remain unknown in their intrinsic nature, so far at least as can be discovered by means of the senses. The question remains whether there is any other method of discovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects.|$|E
