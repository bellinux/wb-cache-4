[...] The Frenchmen consented, for they were now unarmed and could offer no further resistance, as their hands were bound behind them with cords of the arquebuses and with the matches of the soldiers, probably taken from the very arms they had surrendered.|$|E

Again, he was handcuffed, {{but this time}} he was also {{shackled}} and towed a [...] boat, according to his obituary in Los Angeles Times in 2011 and his website. However, according to an account of this event published the day after it occurred in the Los Angeles Times, written by Philip Hager, a Times staff writer, LaLanne was neither handcuffed nor shackled if each of those terms has the conventional meaning of [...] "tightly binding the wrists or ankles together with a pair of metal fasteners". Hager says that LaLanne [...] "had his hands and feet bound with cords that allowed minimal freedom". [...] But [...] "minimal" [...] clearly did not mean [...] "no" [...] freedom, since elsewhere in the article Hager describes LaLanne's method of propulsion through the water as [...] "half-breast-stroke, half-dog paddle" [...] which is how you swim <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> tied.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, an {{anonymous}} {{phone call to}} the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) stated that several heavily armed people were staying at the caller's daughter's house. That afternoon, more than 400 LAPD officers, {{under the command of}} Captain Mervin King, along with the FBI, California Highway Patrol, and Los Angeles Fire Department surrounded the neighborhood. The leader of a SWAT team used a bullhorn to announce, [...] "Occupants of 1466 East 54th Street, this is the Los Angeles Police Department speaking. Come out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> up!" [...] A young child walked out, along with an older man. The man stated that no one else was in the house, but the child intervened stating that several people were in the house with guns and ammo belts. After several more attempts to get anyone else to leave the house, a member of the SWAT team fired tear gas projectiles into the house. This was answered by heavy bursts of automatic gunfire, and a violent gun battle began. The police were firing semi-automatic AR-15 and AR-180 rifles. The SLA members were armed with M1 Carbines, which had been converted to fully automatic fire. Police also reported that the SLA had created homemade grenades from 35mm film canisters, and had thrown them at responding officers.|$|E
