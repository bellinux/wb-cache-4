5|$|Female {{friendship}}s {{are central}} to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, {{but it is the}} friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New <b>Woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E
5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One <b>Woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} exactly when chariot racing began, but It {{may have been}} as old as chariots themselves. It is known from artistic {{evidence}} on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world, but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer, at the funeral games of Patroclus. The participants in this race were Diomedes, Eumelus, Antilochus, Menelaus, and Meriones. The race, which was one lap around the stump of a tree, was won by Diomedes, who received a slave <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cauldron as his prize. A chariot race also {{was said to be}} the event that founded the Olympic Games; according to one legend, mentioned by Pindar, King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race, but was defeated by Pelops, who founded the Games in honour of his victory.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 2006, {{a private}} party {{was held at}} the Jena Fair Barn. Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front of the <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black {{students}} to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students. Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with battery {{for his role in the}} fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head, but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a woolen mask, the ukukus (spectacled bear) {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims. Some also {{go up to the}} glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of glacier ice and carry them on their backs to their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
