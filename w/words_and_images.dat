25|$|Information from {{religious}} sources {{is limited by}} a system of traditional restrictions on what they could describe and depict. The murder of the god Osiris, for instance, is never explicitly described in Egyptian writings. The Egyptians believed that <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> could affect reality, so they avoided the risk of making such negative events real. The conventions of Egyptian art were also poorly suited for portraying whole narratives, so most myth-related artwork consists of sparse individual scenes.|$|E

500|$|Early reviews were positive. [...] The book's {{marketing}} consisted initially of word-of-mouth and in fanzines {{and trade}} periodicals, as mainstream {{newspapers and magazines}} did not normally review comics at the time. [...] Comic book writer Dennis O'Neil called Contract [...] "a masterpiece" [...] that exceeded his expectations. [...] O'Neil wrote {{that the combination of}} <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> mimicked the experience of remembering more accurately than was possible with pure prose. [...] O'Neil's review originally appeared in The Comics Journal, and was used to preface later editions of Eisner's book. [...] Critic Dale Luciano called the book a [...] "perfectly and exquisitely balanced... masterpiece", and praised Kitchen Sink Press for reprinting such a [...] "risky project" [...] in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Agrippa (A Book of the Dead) {{is a work}} of art {{created by}} science fiction novelist William Gibson, artist Dennis Ashbaugh and {{publisher}} Kevin Begos Jr. in 1992. The work consists of a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem by Gibson, embedded in an artist's book by Ashbaugh. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title is taken from a photo album). Its principal notoriety arose {{from the fact that the}} poem, stored on a 3.5" [...] floppy disk, was programmed to encrypt itself after a single use; similarly, the pages of the artist's book were treated with photosensitive chemicals, effecting the gradual fading of the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> from the book's first exposure to light.|$|E

This language is composed of composite words from some sixty to seventy world languages, combined to form puns, or portmanteau words and phrases intended to convey several layers of meaning at once.

500|$|Between 1955 and 1969 over 2,000 {{books were}} {{published}} using lesbianism as a topic, {{and they were}} sold in corner drugstores, train stations, bus stops, and newsstands all over the U.S. and Canada. Most were written by, and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men. Coded <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> were used on the covers. Instead of [...] "lesbian", terms such as [...] "strange", [...] "twilight", [...] "queer", and [...] "third sex", {{were used in the}} titles, and cover art was invariably salacious. A handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians, including Ann Bannon, Valerie Taylor, Paula Christian, and Vin Packer/Ann Aldrich. Bannon, who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction, later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art. Many of the books used cultural references: naming places, terms, describing modes of dress and other codes to isolated women. As a result, pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers.|$|E
500|$|The planet Earth is {{referred}} to as facing the social and environmental problems expected in contemporary society. The generation that boarded the ship intended their descendants to understand and value a terrestrial existence, but over time the <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> associated with being on a planet begin to lose meaning to those on the ship, who become adapted to a shipboard existence, and struggle to understand the motivations of the zeroth generation. Aboard the Discovery, the major religions of Earth are depicted as having gradually lost meaning, but have been replaced by the religious cult of Bliss, with members known as angels. The adherents of the cult believe that their purpose in life is to overcome their connections to a terrestrial existence. They do not see their belief as a religion, and believe that the world outside the ship is an illusion. Only the voyage itself, and not the origin or destination, matters. In contrast to much of Le Guin's science fiction, which explores interactions between humans and extraterrestrial beings, the characters in [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] deal with being literally [...] "extra-terrestrial", or disconnected from terrestrial life.|$|E

500|$|Lennon's love of wordplay and {{nonsense}} {{with a twist}} found a {{wider audience}} when he was 24. Harry writes that In His Own Write (1964) was published after [...] "Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles {{came to me and}} I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about". Like the Daily Howl it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, [...] "Good Dog Nigel", tells the tale of [...] "a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail—until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories [...] "remarkable... also very funny... the nonsense runs on, <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy". Book Week reported, [...] "This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge." [...] Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers [...] "took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me".|$|E

2500|$|Memory {{encoding}} strength {{derived from}} higher levels-of-processing {{appears to be}} conserved despite other losses in memory function with age. Several studies show that, in older individuals, the ability to process semantically in contrast with non-semantically is improved by this disparity.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} sleep the dreamwork disguises the repressed or [...] "latent" [...] content of the dream in an interplay of <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> which Freud describes in terms of condensation, displacement and distortion. This produces the [...] "manifest content" [...] of the dream as recounted in the dream narrative. For Freud an unpleasant manifest content may still represent the fulfilment of a wish {{on the level of}} the latent content. In the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content in order to facilitate access to its latent content. Freud believed interpreting dreams in this way could provide important insights into the formation of neurotic symptoms and contribute to the mitigation of their pathological effects.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{following}} {{the example of}} Metrodorus of Scepsis, vaguely described in Quintilian's Institutio oratoria, Giordano Bruno, a defrocked Dominican, used {{a variation of the}} art in which the trained memory was based in some fashion upon the zodiac. Apparently, his elaborate method was also based in part on the combinatoric concentric circles of Ramon Llull, in part upon schematic diagrams in keeping with medieval Ars Notoria traditions, in part upon groups of <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> associated with late antique Hermeticism, and in part upon the classical architectural mnemonic. According to one influential interpretation, his memory system was intended to fill the mind of the practitioner with images representing all knowledge of the world, and was to be used, in a magical sense, as an avenue to reach the intelligible world beyond appearances, and thus enable one to powerfully influence events in the real world. [...] Such enthusiastic claims for the encyclopedic reach of the art of memory are a feature of the early Renaissance, but the art also gave rise to better-known developments in logic and scientific method during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.|$|E

2500|$|To {{develop the}} {{characters}} for Animorphs, Applegate {{would go through}} teenage magazines such as YM and Seventeen (both of which are referenced in the books when describing Rachel), cutting out pictures and piecing them together {{to get an idea}} of what sort of children the Animorphs would look like. Applegate stated in an interview online that many of the names for her alien creatures, races, and locations are actually scrambled names of local street signs or companies that she happens to notice. For instance, the word nothlit was derived from the hotel name Hilton. According to the Anibase, Applegate did not make up the titles for the Animorphs books: it was up to the Scholastic editors to create the titles for the books based on the outlines provided by the author, having to select a word that not only fit the book's storyline, but sounded good with the characteristic [...] "The" [...] preface. One of the author's favorite books, The Lord of the Rings, lent several <b>words</b> <b>and</b> <b>images</b> to Animorphs: the elvish word for Orc, [...] "yrch", became Yeerk; the flaming red Eye of Sauron inspired the Crayak, and Ax's middle name, [...] "Esgarrouth", is based on a town in the books called Esgaroth. The human name of Ax's brother, Elfangor, is Alan Fangor and his last name is in reference to the Fangor region or Fangorn Forest. Also there was a minor reference to Gondor, in the form of a fictional company named [...] "Gondor Industries" [...] in the 14th book. (It may also be significant that Visser Three's host is named Alloran, a rough homonym of Gandalf's Valinorean name [...] "Olórin", and that one of the minor alien races is called [...] "the Five", which is also a term used in The Lord of the Rings for the Istari.) ...|$|E

The only images that form an actual part of such beliefs are, as a rule, images of <b>words.</b> <b>And</b> <b>images</b> of words, for the reasons considered in Lecture VIII, cannot be distinguished with any certainty from sensations, when, as is often, if not usually, the case, they are kinaesthetic images of pronouncing the words.|$|E
