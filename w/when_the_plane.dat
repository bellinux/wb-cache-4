5|$|According to the Aviation Safety Network, Ethiopian Airlines records {{there have}} been 60 {{accidents}} and incidents since 1965, plus six more for Ethiopian Air Lines, the airline's former name. , these occurrences resulted in 337 deaths. One hijacking is the carrier's deadliest accident, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> plunged into the Indian Ocean due to fuel starvation in 1996. The second-deadliest accident occurred in 2010, when an aircraft crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, killing all 90 people on board. The crash of a Boeing 737-200 in 1988 led to 35 fatalities and ranks as the third most deadly accident experienced by the company. Despite this, Ethiopian Airlines has a good safety record, in contrast to other African airlines.|$|E
5|$|In all, 15 hijackings {{similar to}} Cooper's—all unsuccessful—were {{attempted}} in 1972. With {{the advent of}} universal luggage searches in 1973 (see Airport security), the general incidence of hijackings dropped precipitously. There were no further notable Cooper imitators until July 11, 1980, when Glenn K. Tripp seized Northwest flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, demanding $600,000 ($100,000 by an independent account), two parachutes, and the assassination of his boss. After a 10-hour standoff, he was apprehended, but on January 21, 1983—while still on probation—he hijacked the same Northwest flight, this time en route, and demanded to be flown to Afghanistan. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> landed in Portland, he {{was shot and killed}} by FBI agents.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E
5|$|Mulder visits Max's trailer {{again and}} looks through his mail, finding a luggage claim ticket.

Mulder uses the claim ticket to obtain the third device at a New York airport and heads on a plane to return to Washington. Garrett, who is also aboard, sits next to him. Mulder soon realizes who Garrett is and holds him at gunpoint. Garrett does not care, telling Mulder that if he shoots him the plane will depressurize and {{he will be able to}} escape with a parachute he has with him. Mulder imprisons Garrett in the airplane bathroom but Garrett soon emerges with a zip gun and orders him to hand over the device. Suddenly the plane starts shaking and bright lights shine in through the windows. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> touches down and Mulder gets out both Garrett and the device are gone and Mulder is missing nine minutes, having no memory of what happened.

Enraged, Adrian estimates that the wave will hit the arks in 28 minutes.
