5|$|In April 2008, Arafiles {{arrived at}} WCMH. He {{had earned a}} medical degree in the Philippines {{before coming to the}} United States; he {{continued}} his training in Baltimore and Buffalo. Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998. The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about the manner in which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> applied the clinic's patient care protocols.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} the oppressive regime imposed on them by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Starr and {{his wife}} left on 1 March, after a ten-day stay; McCartney left after one month due to other commitments; Lennon and Harrison stayed about six weeks, then left {{abruptly}} following financial disagreements and rumours of inappropriate behaviour by the Maharishi. Harrison later apologised for the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Lennon had treated the Maharishi, and he gave a benefit concert in 1992 for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party. In 2009, McCartney and Starr performed at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation, which raises funds for the teaching of Transcendental Meditation to at-risk students.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War {{began in}} 1861, {{the demand for}} horses {{increased}} and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them {{as far away as}} New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861 Anderson traveled south with brother Jim and Judge Baker, in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had stated to a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons, rather than loyalty to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.|$|E

5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt in any <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le Mérite.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the only <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E
25|$|Happy {{coincidence}} {{also plays}} its part, {{as when a}} time travel story arc saw Bolland's work coincide with the plot in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to produce a recreated cover from an alternate angle to shed new light on an initially inconsequential image.|$|E
40|$|As {{the author}} {{states at the}} outset, 2 ̆ 2 this book is about the {{impression}} Francis made [...] intentionally {{and in spite of}} himself [...] on contemporaries and on the early generations after his death, and the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and they expressed it. 2 ̆ 2 It makes perfect sense that such a study should focus on Francis given not only the wealth of images, textual and visual, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> inspired after his death, but the wonderfully creative <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> presented himself to his audiences as a preacher and an urban ascetic. Indeed, as the author observes, it was precisely Francis 2 ̆ 7 s image that 2 ̆ 2 bewitched successive generations, as it bewitched contemporaries, into thinking <b>that</b> <b>he</b> brought a new revelation with him 2 ̆ 2 when in fact his spiritual program was highly derivative...|$|R
60|$|Thus appealed to, {{as if he}} was an {{authority}} in such matters, Ben looked wonderfully wise, but refused to give any decision until after he had written the word down on a bit of paper, spelling it in various <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might see which looked correct.|$|R

25|$|Catiline {{spoke with}} an eloquence that demanded loyalty from his {{followers}} and strengthened the resolve of his friends. Without doubt Catiline possessed {{a degree of}} courage that few have, and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died is considered a particularly honorable death in Roman society. Unlike most Roman generals of the late republic, Catiline offered himself to his followers both as a general and as a soldier on the front lines.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the first}} missionaries in Katanga did not {{decide to go}} there at their own initiative. Msiri's {{strategy}} worked: the missionaries' advice prevented him being taken in by the first British and Belgian expeditions (see below). It {{is also possible that}} Msiri had the idea to hold the missionaries hostage in case of any war with the Europeans, in the same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held hostage the women of subject tribes.|$|E
25|$|Biafra {{became a}} spoken word artist in January 1986 with a {{performance}} at University of California, Los Angeles. In his performance he combined humor with his political beliefs, {{much in the}} same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of the Dead Kennedys.|$|E

25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} {{a pocket}} watch. The watches which {{were made in}} Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, in the same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|The Geelong Keys were {{discovered}} around 1845 by Governor Charles La Trobe on Corio Bay. They were {{embedded in the}} stone in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed {{that they had been}} there for 100150 years, possibly dropped by Portuguese explorers. In 1849, Fyans was nominated as the inaugural Mayor of the Geelong Town Council. An early settler of Geelong, Alexander Thomson, for which the area of Thomson in East Geelong is named, settled on the Barwon River, and was Mayor of Geelong on five occasions from 1850 to 1858.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Bleichrodt {{was held}} by the Allies on war crimes charges {{pertaining}} to {{the sinking of the}} City of Benares. Bleichrodt was accused of sinking the ship with the full knowledge that it had been transporting evacuees. He reaffirmed the German position that there was no <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or the crew of the submarine could have known who was on board. It was upheld and he was acquitted. However, Bleichrodt refused to apologise to the survivors, despite several crew members of U-48, including the radio operator, expressing their shock and regret once the facts became known.|$|E

25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never would have thought {{if he had not}} portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should not worry about going mad.|$|E
25|$|Joan {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} at Dourdan in the {{aftermath}} of the Parlement acquittal amidst suggestions that she might also have been having an adulterous affair herself, but enjoyed the continuing support of her husband, Philip. Philip campaigned for her release, which was forthcoming the next year and Joan returned to court. It is unclear why Philip stood by her in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did. One theory has been that he was concerned that if he was to abandon Joan, he might also lose Burgundy, which he had gained through their marriage; another theory suggests that he was in truth very deeply in love with her. With the death after a few days of the baby King John I of France, Joan served as Philip's queen consort for several years; after Philip's death, she inherited the County of Artois from her mother and finally died in 1330.|$|E
