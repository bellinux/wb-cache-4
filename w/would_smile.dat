2500|$|When Gladstone first joined Palmerston's {{government}} in 1859, he had opposed further electoral reform, but {{he changed his}} position during Palmerston's last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns; the policy caused friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement. [...] At {{the beginning of each}} session, Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him. [...] At a lull in Gladstone's speech, Palmerston <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> rap the table with his knuckles, and interject pointedly, [...] "Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business".|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{described}} by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of [...] "inexpressible benignity". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he <b>would</b> <b>smile</b> in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he {{is reported to have}} had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up [...] outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.|$|E

60|$|In her {{compassion}} {{she almost}} <b>smiled.</b> She <b>would</b> have <b>smiled</b> {{if there were}} any such thing as a smile.|$|R
60|$|And your mouth, it <b>would</b> never <b>smile</b> For a long, long while, Then it rippled {{all over}} with {{laughter}} Five minutes after.|$|R

60|$|BECKET. He hath the Pope's last letters, {{and they}} {{threaten}} The immediate thunder-blast of interdict: Yet he can scarce be touching upon those, Or scarce <b>would</b> <b>smile</b> that fashion.|$|E
60|$|Achmet Zek scowled and Werper's heart sank; but Werper did {{not know}} Achmet Zek, who was quite apt to scowl where another <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> and smile where another would scowl.|$|E
60|$|Do what he <b>would,</b> a <b>smile</b> <b>would</b> {{come into}} Mr. Pickwick's face; the smile {{extended}} into a laugh; the laugh into a roar; the roar became general. So, {{to keep up}} their good-humour, they stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to, and ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all round, with a magnum of extra strength for Mr. Samuel Weller.|$|R
60|$|Conroy <b>would</b> have <b>smiled,</b> but {{the chill}} that foreran {{the coming of}} the Lier-in-Wait was upon him, and his hand closed warningly on hers.|$|R
60|$|The lady <b>would</b> have <b>smiled</b> bravely, had the {{strength}} been given her. She tried. And then, with a shudder, she hid {{her face in her}} hands.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>would</b> <b>smile</b> vaguely; murmur a conciliatory [...] "How absurd." [...] But once, out of patience, {{she said}} quite sharply [...] "Leave off. It hurts me. One would think you hate me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{not for me}} to say," [...] was Amy's grim reply, but {{her lips}} <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced at}} Hilda and Lady Meadowcroft. I must say their bearing under these trying {{circumstances}} was thoroughly worthy of two English ladies. They stood erect, looking as though all Tibet might come, and they <b>would</b> <b>smile</b> at it scornfully.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a temptation}} which the captain never resisted; indeed, {{he did not}} regard it as a temptation at all, and <b>would</b> have <b>smiled</b> {{at the idea of}} resistance.|$|R
60|$|Barbara <b>would</b> have <b>smiled</b> at {{any other}} time, for she knew what the ranges were in winter, but, as it was, her face was expressionless and her voice unusually even.|$|R
6000|$|Her lips twitched {{as though}} she <b>would</b> have <b>smiled.</b> [...] "What we have decided," [...] she said, [...] "we have decided. Nothing can alter that, not even the will of Mr. Peter Ruff." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{would attack}} him thus (or {{somewhat}} thus) he <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> and sigh {{like a man}} misunderstood. Once, I remember, he defended himself more at large and had some curious sophistries, worth repeating, for a light upon his character.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have gone}} over the ground myself. It {{could be done in}} even less time. You should ask a few of our friends to that war game, Baron. How they <b>would</b> <b>smile!</b> You read the {{newspapers}} of the country?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{would find}} it for him eventually; {{as often as not}} he was sitting on it. And then he <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> not genially, but with the weariness that comes to a man who feels that fate has cast his lot among a band of hopeless idiots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Spartan girl! Proud Lucy!" [...] she <b>would</b> say, <b>smiling</b> at me. [...] "Graham {{says you}} are the most peculiar, capricious little woman he knows; but yet you are excellent; we both think so." ...|$|R
60|$|He smiled {{this time}} till I thought his <b>smile</b> <b>would</b> swallow him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Donatello hesitatingly; [...] "if it <b>would</b> only <b>smile</b> so {{like the}} {{sunshine}} as you sometimes do. No, it is sadder than I thought at first. Cannot you make yourself smile a little, signorina?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At home Ned {{never spoke}} of his punishments; and if his father {{observed}} a sudden movement which told of a hidden pain, and would say cheerfully, [...] "What! have you been getting it again, Ned?" [...] the boy <b>would</b> <b>smile</b> grimly and nod, but no complaint ever passed his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "if I were to {{tell you}} that there are more {{so-called}} 'sets' in American Society than in your own.

6000|$|... "Forgive me for {{bringing}} you here," [...] he <b>would</b> say, <b>smiling</b> after his crooked fashion, and lifting his hat politely, [...] "but I wish {{to ask you}} if you have not changed your mind as to being mesmerized?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will if I {{can find}} time. It's a hard winter {{and we have}} so much to do," [...] she <b>would</b> answer <b>smiling,</b> and then go home to {{struggle}} back into the patient mood she tried to make habitual.|$|R
60|$|At {{any other}} time Will Osten <b>would</b> have <b>smiled</b> at the solemn manner in which this was said, but there was {{something}} in the hour, and also in the tone of his friend's voice, which tended to repress levity and raise a feeling of anxiety in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be not impatient, sire," [...] he was saying. [...] "Give me two days, {{or three}} at the most, {{and we shall}} make as brave a show at the muster as any.

60|$|I had sat {{listening}} to these jolly folk {{for all this}} time, and I had not heard old Sindbad say a word, and yet I knew very well {{he was full of}} a story, for every now and then I could see his lips move, and he <b>would</b> <b>smile,</b> and anon he would stroke his long white beard and smile again.|$|E
6000|$|ANT.

60|$|You see, if the Laughing Brook {{would never}} laugh any more, and the <b>Smiling</b> Pool <b>would</b> never <b>smile</b> any more, {{there was nothing}} to do but to go down to the Big River to live, and no one wanted to do that, {{especially}} Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle.|$|R
6000|$|Peregrine {{could not}} refrain from boasting to his hostess {{how he had}} once grimaced from outside the church window at Havant, and at the women shrieking that the fiend was there.
