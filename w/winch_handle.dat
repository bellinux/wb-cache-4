They then swept out of the room, followed by the two men with the papers. At the same instant several rough-looking fellows in stout jerkins came bustling in and removed first the red carpet, and then the boards which formed the dais, so as to entirely clear the room. When this screen was removed I saw some singular articles of furniture behind it. One looked like a bed with wooden rollers at each end, and a <b>winch</b> <b>handle</b> to regulate its length. Another was a wooden horse. There were several other curious objects, and a number of swinging cords which played over pulleys. It was not unlike a modern gymnasium.|$|E

50|$|According to the Trajan's column {{representation}} (Scene XL), the carroballista was manoeuvred by one man {{mounted on}} the cart with the ballista and by another man positioned behind the cart and operating probably some sort of <b>winch</b> <b>handle.</b> The presence of the mules {{in front of the}} cart suggests that the carroballista could be easily moved through the battle-field whilst shooting bolts.

50|$|During {{the journey}} {{it became clear}} that repairs had been inadequate. Chains were aded to the {{mainmast}} to help support its topmast, and it was noticed that rivets holding the collar around the mainmast were becoming loose. The ship's carpenter proposed drilling through the mast and inserting a <b>winch</b> <b>handle</b> to ensure the collar stayed in place, but the captain refused. Only the skysail yards were taken down to reduce loading on the masts.|$|E

50|$|Simpson was {{reclassified}} a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-97, effective 23 May 1945. All her armament was removed, and she {{was fitted}} with racks for exercise torpedoes and a <b>winch</b> for <b>handling</b> towed targets. She arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 16 June 1945 and provided training services there for nearly a year. On 11 May 1946, the veteran ship arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard for inactivation. Struck from the Navy list on 19 June 1946, Simpson was sold on 21 November 1946 to Northern Metals Company, Philadelphia, for scrapping.|$|R

50|$|After {{eleven years}} of inactivity, San Carlos {{was taken out}} of reserve on 11 July 1958 and {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navys Military Sea Transportation Service for conversion to an oceanographic research ship by Mobile Ship Repair Company of Mobile, Alabama. Alterations to her original design included the installation of six laboratories, a machine shop, a darkroom, a superstructure deck locker for experimental stowage or work, and a deep-sea <b>winch</b> capable of <b>handling</b> up to 40,000 ft of wire rope and 20 LT of equipment.

50|$|In her 1930s heyday, she {{represented}} {{the most advanced}} technical design for spars, rigging, sails, deck gear and ropes. Her masts were aluminium, made by bending plates and riveting them together.

The standing rigging was solid rod, even in the 1930s, but with so much stretch in the rigging and systems {{it was inevitable that}} J Class masts could not be held in column and would collapse in stronger winds. In anything above a force 3, there was serious concern about holding the rig in place without collapse.|$|R
50|$|Manual hoists, or hand winches, are {{typically}} {{composed of a}} drum, gear box, and crank (operating handle). A worm gear is commonly used to provide mechanical advantage as the crank is turned, which coils a single line around a smooth or helically-grooved drum. The drum line {{is connected to the}} lift lines with a clew, triangular plate with holes used for line terminations. From the clew, the lift lines run over a head block and loft blocks down to a batten. The clew may be wire-guided to limit lateral play. Drill-operable hand <b>winches</b> permit the <b>handle</b> to be removed so that an electric drill may operate the hoist.|$|R
2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both <b>winches</b> that <b>handled</b> the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the state of}} the art for driving technologies of anchor <b>handling</b> <b>winches</b> for offshore operations. These systems are necessary for anchor handling operations associated with installation of many types of moored floating offshore structures. To perform these operations, it is necessary to use specialized vessels known as AHT (Anchor Handling Tug) or AHTS (Anchor Handling Tug Supply) vessel, which incorporate specific equipment such as towing winches, but with higher performance than conventional tugs both in size and in technical performance. There are nowadays two main options for driving the Anchor Handling/Towing winches: hydraulic with low or high pressure motors, and electrical with AC motors driven by Variable Frequency Drives. Additionally, a new technology is appearing in the industrial sector which is starting to be applied in the marine sector, and in some cases for anchor handing winches: the permanent magnet motor. The aim of this paper is to discuss these driving technologies and their importance in the future of this part of the marine sector...|$|R
40|$|According to Norwegian law it is {{forbidden}} to discard dead or dying fish. With recent {{new information about}} mortality of pelagic fish species that have been crowded and released from purse seines, the Norwegian authorities have introduced new regulations for “slipping” (i. e. release of catch from purse seines while the fish {{is still in the}} water) in late phases of hauling a seine. The main objective of this project has been to develop technologies and methods that reduce the extent of unaccounted mortality after crowding and slipping in purse seine fisheries for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and herring (Clupea harengus). The project has been guided by a combined steering and reference committee consisting of active purse seine fishermen, personnel from the fishing gear industry and from fisheries management, who have had the mandate to prioritize research tasks within the frames identified by the project plan. According to recommendations from the steering committee the work has focused on the following two main research areas: 1) To develop methods and equipment for identification of species and catch quality/size in a seine during hauling. The aim was to give the skipper tools to decide whether a catch should be slipped or kept at a stage of hauling where the fish is still viable if released. 2) to develop methods, equipment and procedures for lenient catch regulation from a seine set, with as little stress, physiological load and damage to released fish as possible. The aim was to give the skipper methods and equipment for releasing catch in a responsible manner if slipping is necessary. It is also a goal that the slipping procedure may be approved as a standard method by the authorities. Initially we tried to develop sampling methods based on permanent installations in the net and devices attached to it (i. e. bags built into the net walls and maneuverable landing nets), but with limited success. More successful is the development of a small sampling trawl that is shot into the seine with a line-thrower during net hauling, which was towed back to the vessel by using a small power block. This method showed a promising potential for use as a handy tool for catch identification, and it has now been developed to a stage where it can be tested by the fishing fleet at a commercial level. UV camera systems {{to be used as a}} tool for observing the seine net and the fish inside the net for scientific purposes have also been developed and tested. These systems may also in the future be further developed to commercial products for catch identification, but this has still a long way to go before it reaches a commercial level. Much effort has been put into developing lenient slipping methods, based on technologies traditionally used by seine fishermen for live storage of pelagic fish. One key feature of a responsible slipping technique is that the net can be rapidly opened to make an escape route that is wide enough for the fish to swim freely out of the net. It is also important that it gives the fishermen the opportunity to shut the net when the desired amount has been released. This project has shown that by minor adjustments to components of the bunt (end section) of the seine, this goal may be achieved. This slipping system has the potential to be further refined into a standardized slipping method that may be accepted both by the authorities and the fishing fleet. The costs of adapting existing seines to the new method are low. The most expensive part will be connected to installing an extra <b>winch</b> for <b>handling</b> the opening ropes, if necessary. Further work on standardizing slipping technology is now being planned...|$|R
