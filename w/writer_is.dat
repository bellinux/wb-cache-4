5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fan <b>Writer</b> <b>is</b> the Hugo Award given {{each year}} for writers of works related to science fiction or fantasy which {{appeared}} in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year. There is no restriction that the <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.|$|E
5|$|The report <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> a {{declarative}} {{facility for}} creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout {{and the data}} required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and footings.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} numerous {{death threats}} in the mail, Bart becomes paranoid. It is {{revealed that the}} <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> his enemy, Sideshow Bob, who is incarcerated in Springfield State Prison. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; the parole board is easily convinced that Sideshow Bob {{is no longer a}} threat. When the Simpson family goes to the cinema, Sideshow Bob sits {{in front of them and}} acts obnoxiously. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and Marge angrily tells him to stay away from Bart.|$|E
30|$|The {{approach}} has been evaluated {{on a part of}} the IAM database, where 100 <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> involved. Fifty <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> used to generate the intra-class distances and the rest to generate the inter-class distances. We used three samples per word for the intra-distances. The <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> represented through a single handwriting word made of 5 to 13 characters in length.|$|R
50|$|Even in the US, {{the amount}} that writers get paid can vary. Some American <b>writers</b> <b>are</b> only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have {{to take up a}} second job. Other American <b>writers</b> <b>are</b> more {{successful}} when working for essay mills. Some of the better <b>writers</b> <b>are</b> able to make up to $5,000 per month.|$|R
5000|$|... "Our Country and Our Culture" [...] (Partisan Review Symposium) - Mailer {{discusses}} how <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> not respected as war {{writers and}} {{that a lot of}} <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> feeling alienated during this symposium. He talks about whether or not <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> ever more alienated than that day. Mailer also discusses how the literary history of that time was mostly produced by the newer, younger writers.|$|R
5|$|Another figure, to {{the right}} of Ma≈Çachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian {{confederation}} and the second Sejm marshal. He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing. Between Ma≈Çachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known <b>writer,</b> <b>is</b> visible. He appears to be carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is Micha≈Ç Zabie≈Ç≈Ço (7).|$|E
5|$|Around May 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that Stone had {{turned down the}} opportunity to direct the film, even after months of being pressured {{to do so by}} Douglas, among others. However, in April 2009 Fox confirmed that Stone would be returning as both director and producer, alongside Douglas and Edward R. Pressman. Stone stated that he reconsidered passing on directing the film after the stock market crash. The film was co-produced by Eric Kopeloff with Alessandro Camen and Celia D. Costas serving as executive producers. In addition to screenwriter Loeb, the film's overall <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> Schiff. Bryan Burrough received credit as a consultant, and may have done uncredited work on the story.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> still an issue of debate.|$|E
50|$|This season's <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> Dan Aykroyd, Anne Beatts, Tom Davis, Jim Downey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Al Franken, Brian McConnachie, Lorne Michaels, Don Novello, Herb Sargent, Tom Schiller, Rosie Shuster, Walter Williams and Alan Zweibel. The head <b>writer</b> <b>was</b> Herb Sargent.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} written by Olde English Comedy members Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Dave Segal, and Adam Conover‚Äîas well as former member Joel Clark and OE {{collaborator}} Chioke Nassor. The order of the <b>writers</b> <b>was</b> chosen randomly, and each <b>writer</b> <b>was</b> given a week to write their 15-page section. Since the movie is one-third documentary, the <b>writers</b> themselves <b>are</b> major characters in the film.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{first two}} titles, <b>Be</b> a <b>Writer</b> and <b>Be</b> a Better <b>Writer,</b> <b>were</b> written by Steve Peha, {{president}} of Teaching That Makes Sense.|$|R
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if the <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> {{in a hurry}} and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The only {{discontinued}} awards {{which were}} instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, {{which are not}} voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did. An additional award, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New <b>Writer,</b> <b>is</b> presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award. Beginning an 2018, an unnamed Best Young Adult Book award, also not formally a Hugo Award, will be run similar to the Campbell Award.|$|E
5|$|The John W. Campbell Award for Best New <b>Writer</b> <b>is</b> an American award given {{annually}} {{to the best}} new writer whose first professional work of science fiction or fantasy was published within the two previous calendar years. The prize is {{named in honor of}} science fiction editor and writer John W. Campbell, whose science fiction writing and role as editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact {{made him one of the}} most influential editors in the early history of science fiction. The award is sponsored by Dell Magazines, which publishes Analog. The nomination and selection process is administered by the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) represented by the current Worldcon committee, and the award is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony at the Worldcon, although it is not itself a Hugo Award. All nominees receive a pin, while the winner receives a plaque. Beginning in 2005, the award has also included a tiara; created at the behest of 2004 winner Jay Lake and 2005 winner Elizabeth Bear, the tiara is passed from each year's winner to the next.|$|E

40|$|It {{might be}} tempting to conclude, giving the {{prominence}} of male writers in the Hungarian canon, that until the late 20 th century the question of women <b>writers</b> <b>was</b> rarely raised, if it all, and the contributions of women <b>writers</b> <b>were</b> peripheral. This conclusion, however, would <b>be</b> unfounded. Women <b>writers</b> have <b>been</b> significant in the Hungarian literary tradition for several centuries, as notable examples clearly illustrate...|$|R

25|$|The third <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> usually {{identified}} as George Peele, educated at Christ Church, Oxford, who, like Greene, was notorious for his chaotic lifestyle. Peele {{may already have}} collaborated with Shakespeare; the early play Titus Andronicus is now generally taken to have been co-written by them.|$|E
25|$|Sir Thomas Gery Cullum, surgeon, botanist, antiquarian, and <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> {{buried in}} the church at Hawstead, Suffolk with many of his {{ancestors}} and descendants. Few churches in Suffolk have as many monuments to their dead, say scholars, as the church in Hawstead.|$|E
40|$|Writers in Africa have {{different}} roles to play {{depending on their}} ideologies, environments and maturity. From preoccupation with the oral backgrounds of Africa, most writers have matured towards representing global issues in their themes. From Amos Tutuola to Ayo Dada, the quests of African <b>writers</b> <b>are</b> sociological {{and may not be}} removed from the amplification of the challenges in their environments. The challenges of African <b>writers</b> <b>are</b> dynamic as they are confronted by different realitie emergence of another. <b>Writers</b> <b>are,</b> therefore, social crusaders, teachers and preachers...|$|R

25|$|The best-known {{novel by}} a Malian <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> Yambo Ouologuem's Le devoir de violence, {{which won the}} 1968 Prix Renaudot but whose legacy was marred by accusations of plagiarism. Other {{well-known}} Malian writers include Baba Traor√©, Modibo Sounkalo Keita, Massa Makan Diabat√©, Moussa Konat√©, and Fily Dabo Sissoko.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} works of Mendele Mocher Sforim, a major 19th-century Russian Jewish <b>writer,</b> <b>is</b> the 1878 Masoes Benyomen Hashlishi (◊û◊°◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊î◊©◊ú◊ô◊©◊ô) (The Wanderings of Benjamin III), which is {{considered}} something of a Jewish Don Quixote and whose title is clearly inspired by Benjamin of Tudela's book.|$|E
25|$|A new {{variant of}} the World Era was {{suggested}} in the Chronicon Paschale, a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year 630 AD by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition. It had for its basis a chronological list of events extending from the creation of Adam to the year AD 627. The chronology of the <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> based on the figures of the Bible and begins with 21 March, 5507.|$|E

25|$|The name {{under which}} the <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> universally known did not {{actually}} originate from his own wishes, but was selected and imposed on the public by Arghezi, only one year before Urmuz committed suicide. The spelling Hurmuz, when used {{in reference to the}} writer, was popular in the 1920s, but has since been described as erroneous. The variant Ormuz, sometimes rendered as Urmuz, was also used as a pen name by the activist and novelist A. L. Zissu.|$|E
25|$|However, the Unicode hyphen is {{awkward to}} enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus {{character}} remains very common. They {{are often used}} instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.|$|E
25|$|The Yogabhashya {{states that}} 'yoga' in the Yoga Sutras has {{the meaning of}} 'samadhi'. Another {{commentary}} (the Vivarana) by a certain Shankara, confirms the interpretation of yogah samadhih (YBh. I.1): 'yoga' in Pata√±jali's sutra has the meaning of 'integration'. This Shankara {{may or may not}} have been the famed Vedantic scholar Adi Shankara (8th or 9th century). Scholarly opinion is still open on this issue. Another later <b>writer</b> <b>is</b> VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra (900‚Äì980 CE) who composed the commentary Tattvavai≈õƒÅradƒ´ on the sutras.|$|E
