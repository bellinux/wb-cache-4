5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|In 2007/08 Omega FM was {{established}} in West London and became actively involved in political discussions. By late 2010 {{it was clear that}} Omega FM was {{following in the footsteps of}} pioneering black political pirate stations such as Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, adopting a similar format playing information documentaries concerning black history and Pan Afrikan ideologies along with Nation of Islam and The Nuwaubian ideologies as well as alternative approaches on current affairs, while also playing mostly Reggae music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> other genres of black music that is often politically orientated.|$|E
5|$|Most famous {{among the}} many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The {{earliest}} structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the yali ("mythical beast") pillared Venkataramana temple built in the late 17th century in the Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.|$|E

25|$|Hunt was {{notorious for}} his {{unconventional}} behaviour {{on and off}} the track, which earned him a reputation for cavalier indulgence in both alcohol and sex.

25|$|Having {{resigned}} {{from the government and}} quit the Shevardnadze-run Union of Citizens of Georgia party, Saakashvili founded the United National Movement (UNM) in October 2001, a center-right political party <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> nationalism, to provide a focus for part of the Georgian reformists leaders. In June 2002, he was elected as the Chairman of the Tbilisi Assembly ("Sakrebulo") following an agreement between the United National Movement and the Georgian Labour Party.

25|$|The ECAL is {{constructed}} from crystals of lead tungstate, PbWO4. This {{is an extremely}} dense but optically clear material, ideal for stopping high energy particles. Lead tungstate crystal is made primarily of metal and is heavier than stainless steel, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> oxygen in this crystalline form it is highly transparent and scintillates when electrons and photons pass through it. This means it produces light {{in proportion to the}} particle’s energy. These high-density crystals produce light in fast, short, well-defined photon bursts that allow for a precise, fast and fairly compact detector. It has a radiation length of χ0=0.89cm, and has a rapid light yield, with 80% of light yield within one crossing time (25ns). This is balanced however by a relatively low light yield of 30 photons per MeV of incident energy. The crystals used have a front size of 22mm×22mm and a depth of 230mm. They are set in a matrix of carbon fibre to keep them optically isolated, and backed by silicon avalanche photodiodes for readout.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{criticism}} that Balan's character might evoke, Luthria clarified, [...] "I wanted Vidya to know that what she's doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> class. What her character does, is not cheap." [...] As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Tempo {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "anti-Sjuman" [...] owing to the differences in styles between father and daughter. Sjumandjaja's films tended to fall under social realism, while Ayu's debut had more of a personal, symbolic aspect <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> surrealism. The film does not show Adjeng's molestation, instead symbolizing it by showing a leech feeding; in one case, when Adjeng is raped in a bathtub, losing her virginity, the scene is represented by blood-red water and numerous leeches feeding.|$|E
500|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of electric vehicles like cars, motorcycles and scooters {{are now in}} the process of evaluating sound systems for their products. To assist them in the prototyping process the SoundRacer EVS modules have functions that will give EV manufacturers the tools to test different sounds and settings. Several files with sounds and parameter settings, such as the speed for muting the sound, sound levels and simulated gear changing, can be created with a computer program and stored on a MicroSD card. Changing sounds and settings during test drives is then performed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button.|$|E
