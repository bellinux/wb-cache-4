2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had imagined her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} be reasonable," [...] she begged, with a little break in her voice. [...] "You {{know very well that}} I ought not to listen to you. I ought not to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> I ought to be strong and close my ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Crewe?" [...] said Mr. Gray, with dignified hospitality, {{while their}} fingers slid over each other's; [...] "I'm glad to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> I've noticed the {{interest}} you've {{taken in the}} State, {{and the number of}} ahem--very useful societies to which you belong." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next morning}} the Swallow Chief, , said to the newcomers, [...] "We <b>welcomed</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> among us. We treated you as kin. Yet {{this is how you}} return our kindness. Now you must leave this world." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Engage you! I {{hope you}} are not going to look upon our little {{arrangement}} in that light," [...] Lady St. Maurice said pleasantly. [...] "For your mother's sake, Margharita, I should have been only too glad to have <b>welcomed</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> at any time as my daughter, and I hope that when we know one another better, you will not be quite so independent. Don't be afraid," [...] she added, [...] "you shall have your own way at first. Some day I hope that you will come round to mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Miss Power, with {{a serene}} deliberateness quite {{noteworthy}} in {{a girl of}} her age; 'I have seen it all since. I was mistaken about you, was I not? Mr. Somerset, I am glad to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> both {{as a friend of}} Miss De Stancy's family, and as the son of your father--which is indeed quite a sufficient introduction anywhere.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were right, and I {{hope you}} will find a happy home," [...] rejoined Colonel Zane. [...] "If life among the Indians, proves to be too hard, we shall <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> Betty, show the girls your pets and Indian trinkets. I am going to take the boys to Silas' cabin to see Mr. Wells, and then show them over the fort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} most happy to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> {{as an old}} friend of Mary's," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff, [...] "if you will come to her wedding." [...] Mr Whittlestaff also had seen the {{necessity}} for open speech; and though he was a man generally reticent as to his own affairs, thought {{it would be better to}} let the truth be known at once. Mary, when the word had been spoken as to her wedding, [...] "blushed black" [...] as her stepmother had said of her. A dark ruby tint covered her cheeks and her forehead; but she turned away her face, and compressed her lips, and clenched her two fists close together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must call}} me the Lady Berberisca,' she answered, sharply; 'and {{this is my}} castle, to which I bid <b>you</b> <b>welcome.</b> <b>You</b> shall live <b>here</b> with me and be my husband.' But at these words the knight let his spear fall, so {{surprised}} was he.|$|R

I missed Malcolm after dinner, and {{wondered}} {{what had become of}} him. But come in and get your wet things off. It is a cold <b>welcome</b> keeping <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> My men will take your horses round to the stable and see that they are well rubbed down and warmly littered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I {{think that there}} should be more mixing between what you call plough horses and animals used simply for play, that I have been so proud to make <b>you</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>here.</b> I hope it may not be by many the last time that you will act as a living {{dictionary}} for me. If you won't have any more wine we will go to them in the drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff, [...] "that Miss Lawrie will be {{very sorry}} {{that there should be}} any ground for a quarrel. I am quite well aware that there was some {{friendship}} between you two. Then you went, as you say, and though the friendship need not be broken, the intimacy was over. She had no special reason for remembering you, as you yourself admit. She has been left to form any engagement that she may please. Any other expectation on your part must be unreasonable. I have said that, as an old friend of Miss Lawrie's, I should be happy to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> to her wedding. I cannot even name a day as yet; but I trust that it may be fixed soon. You cannot say even to yourself that Miss Lawrie has treated you badly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, Macumazahn. These are {{the words}} of Zikali: 'O Watcher-by-Night, the time draws on when the Thing-who-should-never-have-been-born will be as though he never had been born, whereat he rejoices. But first there is much for him to do, and as he told you nearly three hundred moons ago, in {{what must be done}} you will have your part. Of that he will speak to you afterwards. Macumazahn, you dreamed a dream, did you not, lying asleep in the house that was built of white stone which now is black with fire? I, Zikali, sent you that dream through the arts of a child of mine who is named Nombe, she to whom I have given a Spirit to guide her feet. You did well to follow it, Macumazahn, for had you tried the other path, which would have led you back to the towns of the white men, you and those with you must have been killed, how it does not matter. Now by the mouth of Nombe I say to you, do not follow the thought that is in your mind as she speaks to you and go to Natal, since if you do so, you and those with you will come to much shame and trouble that to you would be worse than death, over the matter of the killing of a certain white doctor in a swamp where grow {{yellow-wood}} trees. For there in Natal you will be taken, all of you, and sent back to the Transvaal to be tried before a man who wears upon his head horse's hair stained white. But if you come to Zululand this shadow shall pass away from you, since great things are about to happen which will cause so small a matter to be forgot. Moreover, I Zikali, who do not lie, promise this: That however great may be their dangers here in Zululand, those half-fledged ones whom you, the old night-hawk, cover with your wings, shall in the end suffer no harm; those of whom I spoke to you in your dream, the white lord, Mauriti, and the white lady, Heddana, who stretch out their arms one to another. I wait to <b>welcome</b> <b>you,</b> <b>here</b> at the Black Kloof, whither my daughter Nombe will guide you. Cetewayo, the king, also will welcome you, and so will another whose name I do not utter. Now choose. I have spoken.'" ...|$|E

40|$|It is an honour and a {{privilege}} to <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> all <b>here,</b> and to thank you most sincerely for your encouraging response to UNESCO’s invitation to this second meeting of Higher Education Partners, the first having been held three years ago. Our main purpose during {{the next three days}} is to conduct the mid-term review of the follow-up of the World Conference on Higher Education, five years on. Our perspective, however, should be forward-looking – our aim should be that all higher education partners are as well-prepared as possible {{to meet the challenges of}} the next five years and beyond. In the swirl and flux of rapid change, choices and decisions must still be made and it is here that the World Conference and its follow-up are especially important. Their purpose is to help clarify the options available through a vigorous process of multi-partner debate embracing systems and institutions as well as the local, national, regional and international contexts of higher education. I extend my special thanks to our guest of honour- Her Highness Sheika Moza Bint Nasser Abdallah Al-Misnad, First Lady of Qatar, who is present here today in her capacity as a UNESCO Special Envoy for Basic and Higher Education- and to Professor Cristovam Buarque...|$|R

40|$|Australian Institute of Criminology {{that it has}} {{arranged}} to conduct seminars such as this in capital cities outside the Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra triangle. I am very pleased {{to be able to}} <b>welcome</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> and I am sure that the deliberations of this conference will be of major benefit not only to the participants, but also to Tasmanians generally, in raising the profile of criminology matters in this state. I am a Tasmanian politician, and therefore it is appropriate that I should speak a little about politics, and a little about Tasmania. I want to start by examining some of the political motives for keeping people out of prison, and go on to describe the Tasmanian perspective on the issue, and some of the initiatives which we are taking. There is no doubt that two of the major problems facing Australian governments in the criminal justice area are prison overcrowding and the enormous cost of keeping people in prison. This has forced governments to seek alternatives to imprisonment. I {{would like to be able}} to say that governments have introduced alternatives to imprisonment solely for altruistic reasons, but in the present climate the economic imperative looms very large. Even looking back to the introduction of community service orders in Tasmania (o...|$|E
