She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America: in 1988 and in 1991. <b>When</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running, but private polls were unfavorable and, in the end, he ran and was re-elected for the final time.|$|E

Overall, since 1889 the state has voted for Democratic governors 60 {{percent of the time}} and Republican presidents 40 percent of the time. In the 2008 presidential election, Montana was considered a swing state and was ultimately won by Republican John McCain, albeit by a narrow margin of two percent.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, {{questions}} of {{conflict of interest}} regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay. Further concern arose <b>when</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents [...] "for the price of one".|$|E

From 1968 to 2004, Republicans won the county in every election but one, <b>when</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> carried it in 1992. [...] However, the races have almost always been close, such as in 1980, when Ronald Reagan won by a landslide nationwide, but by a mere one percent in Wake County. Recently, Republican George W.

In 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated John McCain 56 to 43 percent, and in 2012 Obama won Wake County again over Mitt Romney with 54 percent of the vote to Romney’s 44 percent – the first time in almost half a century that a Democrat carried the county in consecutive elections. [...] Obama's performance in Wake mirrored his strong showing along the I-85 Corridor.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{progressive}} {{critics argue}} the DLC's centrism {{has led the}} Democratic party to multiple electoral defeats, DLC candidates, office holders, and their moderate policies have been generally favored by the American electorate.

Bill Clinton ran his 1992 and 1996 campaigns as a New Democrat and (prior to Obama's 2012 presidential re-election) became the only twice elected Democratic president since President Franklin D. Roosevelt. New Democrats made significant gains in both the 2006 midterms and the 2008 elections.

50|$|In the United States, {{a pardon}} of the President was once {{considered}} to be a deed and thus needed to be accepted by the recipient. This made it impossible to grant a pardon posthumously.
