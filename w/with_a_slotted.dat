500|$|Measurements of {{microwave}} {{power can be}} made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter. [...] However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter. [...] The {{microwave power}} source is amplitude modulated with, typically, a [...] signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe {{and sent to the}} VSWR meter. [...] This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated carrier directly, which would result in a DC output, because a stable, narrowband, tuned amplifier can be used to amplify the [...] signal. [...] A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range of the detector diode is no more than [...]|$|E
2500|$|The heavy, cold hammer-forged barrel is screwed {{into the}} {{receiver}} and is equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> [...] "bird cage" [...] type flash suppressor that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades (using standard, live ammunition) or attach a knife bayonet (the bayonet is supported by a lug located {{at the base of the}} gas block). The rifled barrel has 6 right-hand grooves and the Swiss Army specification 254mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate is optimized for Swiss military GP 90 ammunition.

50|$|Mobitex is a packet-switched, narrowband, data-only {{technology}} {{mainly for}} short burst data. Mobitex channels are 12.5 kHz wide. In North America, Mobitex runs at 900 MHz, while in Europe it uses 400 - 450 MHz. The modulation scheme used is GMSK <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> aloha protocol at 8000 bit/s, although user throughput is typically around half of that.|$|E
50|$|The HK21 has a heavy, quick-change barrel fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> flash {{suppressor}} and adjustable iron sights with a hooded foresight {{and an aperture}} rear sight adjustable from 100 through 1200 m in 100 m increments. By simply swapping out several components such as the barrel, bolt and feed unit, the weapon can be quickly converted to the intermediate 7.62×39mm and 5.56×45mm calibers.|$|E
50|$|The {{rifled barrel}} (contains 4 {{right-hand}} grooves with a 305 mm twist rate) terminates <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> flash suppressor {{which can also}} be used to attach a bayonet or serve as an adapter for launching rifle grenades. From the G3A3 the barrel had polygonal rifling. The barrel chamber is fluted, which assists in the initial extraction of a spent cartridge casing (since the breech is opened under very high barrel pressure).|$|E
50|$|ESPN was {{a premium}} sport channel {{offering}} Premier League football among other sports for a monthly fee. The channel could be accessed through a conditional-access module (CAM), {{set top box}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot,</b> <b>an</b> IDTV <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slot</b> or through <b>a</b> Top Up TV Freeview+ box. It replaced Setanta Sports 1 when its parent company went into administration and was closed. Because this channel time-shared with the downloads for the TV Favourites service, it was barred from broadcasting 24 hours a day. Between Setanta Sports 1 closing and ESPN launching, ESPN America filled airtime whilst carriage negotiations were ongoing. The channel is still offered by BT TV under their BT Sport package.|$|R

S. Krichyevskii died suddenly late in 1935.|$|E
5000|$|A {{deep well}} {{typically}} {{consists of a}} borehole fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> liner and an electric submersible pump. As water is pumped from a deep well, a hydraulic gradient is formed and water flows into the well forming a cone of depression around the well {{in which there is}} little or no water remaining in the pore spaces of the surrounding soil. Deep wells work best in soils with a permeability of k = [...] m/s to [...] m/s; the amount of drawdown that a well can achieve is limited only by the size of the fish pump.|$|E

50|$|The ČZ 2000 system weapons share a {{high degree}} of parts commonality, and differ mainly with regards to barrel length and certain minor components, i.e. both the rifle and light machine gun are fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> “birdcage” flash suppressor, whereas the carbine has a conical flash hider. Furthermore, the carbine {{features}} a shorter (than the rifle and LMG) piston operating rod, gas cylinder and handguard. The rifle and LMG can be fitted with a bipod (attached to the muzzle end of the barrel, folded under the barrel) and the rifle {{can also be used to}} mount a bayonet and underslung grenade launcher (the designers did not envision the need for launching rifle grenades).|$|E
50|$|The {{three phase}} {{induction}} regulator {{can be regarded}} as a wound induction motor. The rotor is not allowed to turn freely and it can be mechanically shifted by means of a worm gear. The rest of the regulator's construction follows that of a wound rotor induction motor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slotted</b> three-phase stator and a wound three-phase rotor. Since the rotor is not allowed to turn more than 180 degrees, mechanically, the rotor leads can be connected by flexible cables to the exterior circuit. If the stator winding is a two-pole winding, moving the rotor through 180 degrees physically will change the phase of the induced voltage by 180 degrees. A four-pole winding only requires 90 degrees of physical movement to produce 180 degrees of phase shift.|$|E
