40|$|During the {{earthquakes}} in Japan and California in the 1990 s, cracks {{appeared in}} some <b>weld</b> beam-to-column <b>connections</b> of heavy rigid frame steel buildings. This prompted the necessary {{assessment of the}} performance of <b>weld</b> <b>connections</b> in terms of rotation capacity and crack propagation. In the present study, experimental tests were performed where <b>weld</b> <b>connections</b> were submitted to cyclic loadings with increasing amplitude until a macro crack event was reached. However the crack phenomenon depends on many parameters: the geometry, the material, the welding process…. For this reason, it was interesting to develop a finite element modeling of these connections in order to complete these experiments and perform a parametric study. This paper describes the finite element model development, its material parameter identification and its comparison with experimental results. The <b>weld</b> <b>connections</b> were modeled by using three-dimensional mixed solid elements. The constitutive laws applied were elastoplastic with isotropic hardening identified for the base metal and the weld metal. Crack propagation was modeled by a cohesive zone model. The parameters of this cohesive zone model were identified by an inverse method with the modeling of three point bending tests of precracked samples performed on the base and weld metals. The fatigue damage generated by the cyclic loading was computed by the fatigue continuum damage model of Lemaitre and Chaboche, which was coupled with the cohesive zone model. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Magnetic liquid seals are {{engineered}} for a {{wide range}} of applications and exposure but are generally limited to sealing gases and vapors, not direct pressurized liquid. Each particular combination of construction materials and design features has practical limits with respect to temperature, differential pressure, speed, applied loads and operating environment; however, these limits can generally be overcome by carefully selecting or designing the device for the application. Necessary features may include multiple ferrofluid stages, water cooling, customized materials including metals, permanent magnets and ferrofluid, and exotic bearings.

50|$|Cold forming has {{the effect}} of {{increasing}} the yield strength of steel, the increase being the consequence of cold working well into the strain-hardening range. This increase is in the zones where the material is deformed by bending or working. The yield stress can be assumed to have been increased by 15% or more for design purposes. The yield stress value of cold-formed steel is usually between 33ksi and 80ksi. The measured values of Modulus of Elasticity based on the standard methods usually range from 29,000 to 30,000 ksi (200 to 207 GPa). A value of 29,500 ksi (203 GPa) is recommended by AISI in its specification for design purposes. The ultimate tensile strength of steel sheets in the sections has little direct relationship to the design of those members. The load-carrying capacities of cold-formed steel flexural and compression members are usually limited by yield point or buckling stresses that are less than the yield point of steel, particularly for those compression elements having relatively large flat-width ratios and for compression members having relatively large slenderness ratios. The exceptions are bolted and <b>welded</b> <b>connections,</b> the strength of which depends not only on the yield point but also on the ultimate tensile strength of the material. Studies indicate that the effects of cold work on formed steel members depend largely upon the spread between the tensile and the yield strength of the virgin material.|$|E

Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge deck transverse female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a <b>welded</b> stud <b>connection</b> and a post tensioned connection. A variation of the <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of post tensioning a connection.

40|$|One of {{the widely}} used systems for {{offshore}} oil production in water depths up to 500 - 2500 meters is a steel catenary riser (SCR). Requirements for long-term corrosion resistance of SCR are very stringent, that obliges to manufacture it from expensive steels. Still, the increased water depth leads to increased riser tension, grown pressure, aggravated buckling and oscillation problems. Among alternative materials to manufacture catenary risers, i. e., steel, titanium and aluminum alloys, the aluminum {{is the best}} from the “Strength/Weight/Cost ” aspects with its high corrosion strength. Design of an aluminum catenary production riser (ACPR) was developed in Russia; and comprehensive tests were performed on mechanical characteristics and corrosion resistance properties of ACPR tubes and their connections. Two possible connections of riser sections were considered, i. e., welded and threaded. Strength analysis of threaded connection was performed by FEM. Mechanical testing included: testing of small samples of pipe material and <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> cut out of riser section, testing of full-scale specimens of connection prototypes, and measurement of residual stresses.

40|$|For {{cyclically}} loaded structures, fatigue design {{becomes one of}} the important design criteria. The state of art shows that with modification of the conventional structural design methodology, the use of very high strength steels may {{have a positive effect on}} fatigue strength of <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> However, there is little known about the repair of fatigue cracks in <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> made of very high strength steels. In this study, the fatigue strength of the repaired base material and repaired fatigue damaged V-shape <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> made of very high strength steels is investigated. This thesis consists of four parts. In Part I, the emphasis was put on the effects of the material imperfections on the fatigue strength of materials and this part consists of an extensive literature study and a microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces of the base material of very high strength steels. Part II presents a literature survey on the fatigue crack repair methods and the results of the experimental programme of the current study. The experimental programme comprises fatigue tests on the repaired base material and repaired V-shape <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> made of very high strength steels. The V-shape welded specimens were made of rolled and cast steel plates. In Part III, fatigue strength prediction models were evaluated and a comparison was made between the fatigue strength curves from the prediction models and the fatigue strength curves of the test results. In the last part, conclusions and recommendations from the study are presented.

Although this notion has existed for the static design of such connections, its implementation into design recommendations or specifications has never been checked against existing test data. This is performed herein, using a database of gapped and overlapped CHS-to-RHS N-connection tests undertaken by others, and the suitability of this procedure is examined for both existing and proposed new static design recommendations for RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> For fatigue design, no design guidance exists for CHS-to-RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> Thus, a database of welded CHS-to-RHS T-connection fatigue tests, undertaken by both the authors and others, under branch axial loading or branch in-plane bending, is used to evaluate the replacement of the circular branch with an equivalent square branch, in the context of contemporary fatigue design procedures. It is shown that, for the connection types examined, this substitution of a circular branch member by an equivalent square branch member is a valid operation, with an adequate level of safety, for both the static and fatigue design of such connections. This indicates that existing design rules for planar RHS-to-RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> can likely suffice for the unusual case of CHS-to-RHS <b>welded</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|E
