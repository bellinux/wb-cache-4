50|$|The cyclone also {{disrupted}} {{gold and}} mineral mining work in southern Western Australia, closing landing strips at Leinster and Wiluna. Nickel mining near Leinster, mostly from WMC Resources's Mount Keith Mine, was impeded by rainfall which obstructed extraction of ore from the pit. The Super Pit gold mine at Kalgoorlie, meanwhile, was closed after 156 mm of precipitation fell within a three-day period; all major mines within the vicinity {{were forced to}} halt operations. Meanwhile, the Kanowna Belle, New Celebration, Sons of Gwalia, {{and dozens of other}} open-pit mines also suspended mining activities due to obstructed roads as well as <b>wet</b> <b>pits</b> and facilities. Several mines suffered fuel shortages, with many roads inaccessible to fuel-transporting vehicles. While the North Rankin A and Goodwyn oil platforms were in the path of Bobby, both facilities escaped damage, and in fact drilled considerably higher amounts as a result of increased demand for gas from utilities on land. The adjacent Perseus platform, however, temporarily shut down operations. Australian gold industry officials estimated total economic disruptions amounted to upwards of $50 million (1995 AUD; $38.7 million USD).|$|R
5000|$|The pit {{was known}} as a <b>wet</b> <b>pit,</b> the lower main would flood with {{seawater}} percolating through the roof of the seam from the North Sea above it. A substantial pump was therefore employed to keep the pit workable. As was common practice at that date the pump was a beam engine working the pumps directly. The pumps were in three stages. The lowest stage lifted water from a sump connected to an adit below the low main seam up to the yard seam. There a second stage lifted the water up to a sump in the high main. These first two stages were driven by the main beam. The third stage was driven by a subsidiary beam above the pump staple (C). The pump was a nominal 300 horsepower making it the largest pumping engine in the North of England.

40|$|A single {{campaign}} of mass treatment for bancroftian filariasis with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in Makunduchi, {{a town in}} Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania, combined with elimination of mosquito breeding in pit latrines with polystyrene beads {{was followed by a}} progressive decline over a 5 -year period in the microfilarial rate from 49 % to 3 %. Evidence that vector control had contributed to this long-term decline was obtained by comparison with another town, Moga, where a DEC campaign was used without vector control and where resurgence of microfilariae could be observed 3 - 6 years after the campaign. In Zanzibar town, treatment of 3844 <b>wet</b> <b>pit</b> latrines and cesspits with polystyrene beads reduced the adult mosquito population in houses by about 65 %. Supplementary treatment of open drains and marshes with Bacillus sphaericus produced little or no additional reduction compared to a sector of the town where only pit treatment with polystyrene was carried out.

40|$|Hanford Site {{high-level}} waste tanks are interim stabilized by pumping supernatant and interstitial waste liquids to double-shell tanks (DSTs) through a saltwell pump (SWP). The motor to this SWP is located atop the tank, inside a <b>pump</b> <b>pit.</b> A <b>pumping</b> line extends {{down from the}} pump motor into the well area, located in the salt/sludge solids in the tank below. Pumping of these wastes {{is complicated by the}} fact that some of the wastes generate and retain potentially hazardous amounts of hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and ammonia. Monitoring of flammable gas concentrations during saltwell pumping activities has shown that one effect of pumping is acceleration in the release of accumulated hydrogen. A second effect is that of a temporarily increased hydrogen concentration in both the dome space and <b>pump</b> <b>pit.</b> There is a safety concern that the hydrogen concentration during saltwell pumping activities might approach the lower flammability limit (LFL) in either the tank dome space or the <b>pump</b> <b>pit.</b> The current Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) (CHG 2000) for saltwell pumping requires continuous flammable gas monitoring in both the <b>pump</b> <b>pit</b> and the tank vapor space during saltwell pumping. The FSAR also requires that portable exhauster fans be available by most of the passively ventilated tanks to be saltwell pumped in the event that additional air flow is required to dilute the headspace concentration of flammable gases to acceptable levels. The first objective of this analysis is to review the need for an auxiliary exhauster. Since the purpose of the exhauster is to diffuse unacceptably high flammable gas concentrations, discovery of an alternate method of accomplishing the same task may provide cost savings. The method reviewed is that of temporarily stopping the saltwell pumps. This analysis also examines the typical hydrogen concentration peaks and the rates of increase in hydrogen levels already witnessed in tanks during saltwell pumping activities. The historical data show that these rates and maximum concentrations are so low as to make it unlikely that the LFL concentration would ever be approached. The second objective of this analysis is to review the data provided by two separate flammable gas measurement systems on each tank being saltwell pumped to see if there is an unnecessary redundancy. Eliminating redundant measurement systems would provide cost savings if the quality of data and resultant margin of safety during saltwell pumping activity are not compromised...|$|R

50|$|From {{an early}} {{date to the}} {{beginning}} of the 19th century, coal-mining played an important role in Birchgrove. It was mainly on coal-mining that the villages of the parish grew, and Birchgrove was no exception. Mining played a very important role in the industrial development of the lower Swansea Valley, which was becoming the metallurgical centre of the world. (See History of Swansea.) Coal was replacing wood in the smelting of ores; and it was because of the demand for coal that a pit was sunk in Birchgrove, known as Birchgrove Colliery Company, locally known as the 'Old Pit'. It was situated just below the Birchgrove Post Office. It was sunk in 1845, to a depth of approximately 100 feet. As a result of its prosperity, two further pits were sunk, namely Sisters Pit, and Brothers Pit near Glais. Approximately 200 worked at the Old Pit. This involved many new people coming into the area, to work in both mining and the copper industry. The only cultural recreation was a Reading Room, situated near the colliery. It was not used on Sundays, so the people of the village were given permission to use it for Sunday worship. Services were held there according to the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England (the Church in Wales not being founded until 1920). The services held there were well supported. The Birchgrove Colliery was closed in 1931.There are still relics of Birchgrove's industrial past in the area, The ruins of Scot's <b>pit</b> <b>pump</b> house dominate the lower end of Birchgrove and evidence of mine workings can still be found.|$|R

50|$|Quarries {{in level}} areas with shallow {{groundwater}} or which are located close to surface water often have engineering problems with drainage. Generally {{the water is}} removed by pumping while the quarry is operational, but for high inflows more complex approaches may be required. For example, the Coquina quarry is excavated to more than 60 ft below sea level. To reduce surface leakage, a moat lined with clay was constructed around the entire quarry. Ground water entering the <b>pit</b> is <b>pumped</b> up into the moat. As a quarry becomes deeper, water inflows generally increase and it also becomes more expensive to lift the water higher during removal; this can become the limiting factor in quarry depth.
