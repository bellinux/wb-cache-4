5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
500|$|Just as Pam {{is telling}} the cameras {{that she does not}} think that it would work out between her and Jim, he bursts into the room and asks her out to dinner. [...] Stunned, she agrees, and Jim says, [...] "Alright. Then, it's a date." [...] After Jim exits the room, [...] Pam becomes visibly joyous and forgets <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Jack-Tor": Liz {{tries to}} quote global {{education}} statistics, only {{to mess up}} and realize {{that she does not}} know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|The more {{he thought}} of it, the more this struck Peter as good advice. So he hopped over {{to the foot of}} the fence post on which Winsome Bluebird was sitting. [...] "Jenny Wren says that you and Welcome Robin <b>are</b> cousins. <b>She</b> doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about, does she?" [...] asked Peter.|$|R
5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} the interview, {{she also}} asked whether he had ever smoked [...] "endo," [...] a slang {{reference}} to marijuana. Looking uncomfortable, the host told the singer that he had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about; Madonna called him a liar which led Letterman to make light of the embarrassing question by acting like Johnny Carson.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying on the kitchen floor of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
2500|$|Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes: Maddie Hayes is a chic {{and smart}} former high-fashion model. Left {{bankrupt}} when her accountant embezzles {{all of her}} money, she is forced {{to make a living}} by running the detective agency she had previously owned as a tax write-off. Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Cybill Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a “Hawksian” comedy. [...] The two had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. [...] A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.|$|E
60|$|The captain grunted again, and, in a {{voice that}} he vainly endeavoured to render polite, said {{that he did not know}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
50|$|The bewildered Marquis {{is taking}} the air when he is confronted by a furious Elisa, who accuses him of {{ordering}} the kidnapping. He has no idea who <b>she</b> <b>is</b> or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about, and, assuming her to be mad, rushes off, pursued by Elisa. Carlotta arrives, distressed because <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> unable to find Elisa, but the servants cannot help.|$|R
50|$|Cartman {{then has}} {{a dream of}} Aunt Jemima (a parody {{reference}} to Mother Abigail), who tells him the food pyramids are upside-down, and Cartman has no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about. As the gluten-free toppings at the Papa John's run out, the unnamed resident eats the pizza dough containing gluten, thinking it's all a set up, but he dies.|$|R
5000|$|Elfman filmed her scenes {{first with}} a puppet {{in order for the}} animators to have a {{reference}} point, and then in a later take without anything to show <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to. Dratch did her voice work separately in New York with the scenes already filmed. She said at the TCA press tour, [...] "I have the freedom to go crazy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said I, not {{understanding}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> [...] "I am sure {{he will be}} buried somewhere near his home, and when I go back his grave {{will be one of}} the first places I will visit." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Duncan {{thought the}} girl did look uncommonly {{as if she}} knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington had some such impression, too, as they stared at her. Cynthia's eyes flashed, but her voice was no louder than before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{the power}} to get a divorce? It's just your want of the power that makes the scandal of your {{connexion}} with her. Therefore it's just her want of it that makes that of hers with you. That's all I contend!" [...] Mrs. Wix concluded with an unparalleled neigh of battle. Oh she did know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about!</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|When the African American then State Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, later {{a member}} of the United States House of Representatives, filed a {{complaint}} with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1973, Calvert said in response, that Johnson was a [...] "nigger woman who doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about." [...] The EEOC ruled that racial discrimination could be inferred based on Calvert's response.|$|R
6000|$|Did it? Did <b>what?</b> <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>talking</b> about? I {{tried to}} put the {{question}} to her. I struggled--quite vainly--to say only these words: [...] "What <b>are</b> you <b>talking</b> about?" ...|$|R
50|$|Everybody excitedly {{believes}} that Lew has booked {{them on the}} TV show. Lew continually tries to get in to see Crosby's actual producer, totally in vain. He lies to the singers that Crosby won't book them because he is jealous of Dan's ability as a singer. A furious Nancy barges into the TV studio to berate Crosby and his producer, who have no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{had nothing}} to answer. He was very much afraid that old Jane knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and his mind was {{occupied}} with {{trying to decide what}} he, individually, ought to do about it. Old Jane was now obliged to go to the toll-gate to attend to a traveler, but when she came back she took occasion to say a few more words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, Jegu {{must have}} done this {{in the hope of}} my giving him a dance,' she thought to herself, and when she met him outside the door she stopped and thanked him for his help. To be sure, Jegu only replied roughly that he didn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> but this answer made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.|$|E
60|$|So now, as I say, {{the talk}} rather hung fire. It {{had been all}} very well for me to promise Gussie that I would cut loose to this girl about aching hearts, but you want a cue {{for that sort of}} thing. And when, toddling along, we reached the edge of the lake and she finally spoke, {{conceive}} my chagrin when I discovered that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> was stars.|$|E
40|$|She, {{who writes}} from Iran, {{tells me she}} {{experiences}} the question of emotions, the emotional illiteracy/literacy divide, as a major obstacle {{in the process of}} translation between here and there. I understand <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about as I am on the ‘there’ side of this divide and am concerned about it, about the divide: what ways of relating can we come up with to negotiate it, to bridge this divide...|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is performed successfully. When Amy and Derek's brother walk in, {{he has no}} idea who they are. Outside the room, Cameron apologizes to Amy for the burden of caring for Derek landing so soon before her wedding. However, Amy has no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about as <b>she's</b> not even dating Derek's brother. Meanwhile, House and Wilson meet in rehab. House apologizes to Wilson for everything.|$|R
5000|$|Later Renee reveals <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{physically}} and mentally abused by her father, prompting Lauren to reveal that <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> raped by her grandfather. Bianca, confused about this, starts asking why their mothers [...] "didn't do anything" [...] upsetting Renee who leaves the room shouting at Bianca that <b>she</b> doesn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about. Throughout the program Tyra interviews the girls, as well as Renee's mother after the Bianca and Renee fight segment.|$|R
6000|$|In one of {{the window}} {{recesses}} Rhapsodie Pantril was talking vaguely but beautifully to a small audience {{on the subject of}} chromatic chords; she had the advantage of knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> an advantage that her listeners did not in the least share. [...] "All through his playing there ran a tone-note of malachite green," [...] she declared recklessly, feeling safe from immediate contradiction; [...] "malachite green, my colour--the colour of striving." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} that I could trust him for that. I could not expect any more from him, and indeed {{none of us}} were bound in honour. The fault was with the Duke of Anjou, who, as we all know, was an incorrigible chatter-box all his life, and never was trusted with any State secrets at all; but his mother must have supposed him not {{old enough to understand}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> when she let him overhear such a conversation.|$|E
60|$|The full {{significance}} {{of her words}} did not instantly appear to him. Then it dawned. Good heavens! She was discussing love-making. For a time he heard no more, and stared with stony eyes at a Book-War proclamation in leaded type that filled half a column of the Times that day. Could she understand <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> Luckily it was a second-class carriage and the ordinary fellow-travellers were not there. Everybody, he felt, must be listening behind their papers.|$|E
5000|$|In the Inuyasha dub, {{the name}} Adamant Barrage {{is given to}} an attack that shoots {{diamonds}} at the opponent using the Tessaiga, the sword used by the title character. In the episode The Demon Protector of the Sacred Jewel Shard, a demon named Hosenki is covered in an armor made up {{of what is called}} adamantite. Kagome asks Myoga if he means diamond, but he does not know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|Winsome chuckled. It was a soft, gentle chuckle. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, nodding his head, [...] "we are. You {{can trust}} that little busybody to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about, every time. I {{sometimes}} think she {{knows more about}} other people's affairs than about her own. Welcome and I may not look much alike, but we are cousins just the same. Don't you think Welcome is looking unusually fine this spring?" ...|$|R
5000|$|After <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{considered}} a disappointing election result for UKIP {{in the local}} elections of May 2011, Andreasen called for her leader Nigel Farage to resign. The party responded that it had made gains in the election and that her statement [...] "displays what one might perhaps charitably call a naivety in its analysis of the UK electoral scene". During a TV interview, Farage himself responded that Andreasen was out of touch and [...] "didn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about".|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are we, where, in {{the name}} of all that's damnably, of all that's grotesquely delusive, are we?" [...] he said, without a sign, to himself; which was the form of his really being quite at sea as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> That {{uncertainty}} indeed he could but frankly betray by taking her up, as he cast about him, on the particular ambiguity that his voice perhaps already showed him to find most irritating. [...] "Let it show? 'It,' dear Princess----?" ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. She met Harry at {{the club}} and took rather a fancy to him. When I told her Daisy was a half-caste and people didn't bother much about her she got right up on her hind legs. I told her she'd only just come out to China and didn't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> and then she gave me what she called a bit of her mind. I was obliged to remark that if that was a bit I didn't much care about knowing the rest.|$|E
60|$|Here this {{extraordinary}} woman broke off her speech, or chant, {{which was so}} much musical gibberish to us, for all that we understood of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> and seemed to fix her flashing eyes upon the deep shadow before her. Then in a moment they acquired a vacant, terrified stare, {{as though they were}} striving to realise some half-seen horror. She lifted her hand from Leo's head, and pointed into the darkness. We all looked, and could see nothing; but she saw something, or thought she did, and something evidently that affected even her iron nerves, for, without another sound, down she fell senseless between us.|$|E
5000|$|Sometime {{later that}} day, Tom ponders Jared's {{disappearance}} and emotes to Marilyn, who is crying next to him. When Tom asks what is wrong, Marilyn responds, [...] "You should have saved me." [...] Tom begins to ask <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about, {{only to be}} interrupted by the Driver revving his engine. Tom {{looks out the window}} and into the truck's cab, seeing Marilyn in the passenger's seat next to the Driver. Tom rushes out onto the empty highway and looks around, realizing that Marilyn is dead.|$|R
60|$|She {{would stand}} behind Phillips's chair with her fat arms round his neck, nodding her {{approval}} and encouragement; while Joan, seated opposite, would strain every nerve {{to keep her}} brain fixed upon the argument, never daring to look at poor Phillips's wretched face, with its pleading, apologetic eyes, lest she should burst into hysterical laughter. <b>She</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being helpful and inspiring! Mrs. Phillips would assure her afterwards that <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> wonderful. As for herself, there <b>were</b> periods when <b>she</b> hadn't the faintest idea about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|R
60|$|Surely it {{was time}} for her to return home, though <b>she</b> should <b>be</b> more sorry to leave the {{mountain}} castle than she could ever have believed possible. She entreated her father to take her home, but she received a sharp answer that she did not know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> of: the Schlangenwald Reitern were besetting all the roads; and moreover the Ulm burghers had taken the capture of the Constance wine in such dudgeon that for a retainer of Adlerstein to show himself in the streets would be an absolute asking for the wheel.|$|R
