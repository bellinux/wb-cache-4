In order to machine the 300 mm~ 400 mm silicon wafer to the specified surface roughness and flatness, precision ELID (electrolytic in-process dressing) diamond grinding and CMP (chemical-mechanical polishing) were employed in this study to replace the conventional grinding, etching and polishing routine. Various machining conditions such as <b>wheel</b> <b>grain</b> size, spindle speed, feedrate, ELID conditions and CMP parameters were studied in the present research.

In this research the form accuracy indices of flat workpieces EFEmax (the main parameter) and two additional indices EFEa and EFEq called the arithmetic average and the quadratic average, respectively are used (GOST 24642 - 81).

This paper states that grinding by the coarse-grained HPW 5 SG 46 in comparison with the small-grained 5 SG 60 made it possible to increase the form accuracy by the predicted medians within the same accuracy quality class: for EFEmax – TFE 7; for EFEa and EFEq – TFE 6. The precision of the form accuracy of the parts 30 ChGSA increased most significantly: for EFEmax it increased by 5 times, for EFEa by 3. 1 times, and for EFEq by 4. 2 times. The fact that the heights of microasperity remained practically at the same level [] 11. 0; 1. 0 ∈•aR, µm; [] 72. 0; 7. 0 max ∈•R, µm was due to the features of the synthetic corundum grain structure.

The grinding ratio of SKH 4 is far better than HV 5 in both this value and in a tendency of G-t curves. 2.

40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{theoretical}} analysis of the mechanics of the diamond grinding process, taking into account the wear of the <b>wheel</b> <b>grains</b> for scientifically based choice of optimal processing conditions. A multiplicative probabilistic approach to the generalization of the cutting profile of a diamond grinding wheel in its consideration in a state of some steady wear during processing is considered. This is achieved by working the wheel in a mode of properly established self-sharpening or with the use of effective dressing methods. In this case, the linear wear of individual grains of diamond abrasive located on the working surface of the grinding wheel and opened to mechanical contact with the material being processed is assumed to proportionally to the depth of the introduction of grain into it. The analytical dependence of the maximum thickness of the cut is presented, and the relationship between the maximum grain wear and the accepted universal relative characteristic of the steady wear with the operational parameters of the tool and the grinding mode is shown. The obtained results can be used in the development of analytical models of processing productivity and microgeometric engineering of the treated surface, new approaches to increasing the efficiency of diamond grinding.

40|$|AbstractGrinding causes {{progressive}} dulling and glazing of {{the grinding}} <b>wheel</b> <b>grains</b> and clogging of the voids on the wheel's surface with ground metal dust particles, which gradually increases the grinding forces. The {{condition of the}} grains at the periphery of a grinding wheel strongly influences the damage induced in a ground workpiece. Therefore, truing and dressing {{must be carried out}} frequently. Dressing is the process of conditioning the grinding wheel surface to reshape the wheel when it has lost its original shape through wear, giving the tool its original condition of efficiency. Despite the very broad range of dressing tools available today, the single-point diamond dresser is still the most widely used dressing tool due to its great versatility. The aim of this work is to predict the wear level of the single-point dresser based on acoustic emission and vibration signals used as input variables for fuzzy models. Experimental tests were performed with synthetic diamond dressers on a surface-grinding machine equipped with an aluminum oxide grinding wheel. Acoustic emission and vibration sensors were attached to the tool holder and the signals were captured at 2 MHz. During the tests, the wear of the diamond tip was measured every 20 passes using a microscope with 10 to 100 X magnification. A study was conducted of the frequency content of the signals, choosing the frequency bands that best correlate with the diamond's wear. Digital band-pass filters were applied to the raw signals, after which two statistics were calculated to serve as the inputs for the fuzzy models. The results indicate that the fuzzy models using the aforementioned signal statistics are highly effective for predicting the wear level of the dresser...|$|R
