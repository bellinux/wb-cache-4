40|$|ABSTRACT. In a {{diffusion}} model of an enterprise with variable scale, suf-ficient conditions are {{given for the}} maximization of expected profit (expected total discounted withdrawals) to lead to eventual bankruptcy with probability one. The optimal withdrawal policy is an "overflow policy, " in which the with-drawal rate is eqcal to zero if the asset level is below a "barrier, " and equal to the maximum rate if the asset level is {{greater than or equal}} to the barrier. The optimal policy for the control of the drift (yield) and volatility (risk) of the earnings process is derived as the solution of a differential equation, and a formula is given for the corresponding value function. The optimality of the constructed policy is demonstrated using the standard "Bellman Conditions. " 1. INTRODUCTION. In models of an enterprise with "fixed productive capacity, " Dutta and Radner (1993), and Radner and Shepp (1996), have shown that the maximization of 'Lprofit, " i. e., expected total discounted <b>withdrawals</b> <b>from</b> cash <b>reserves</b> (retained earnings), leads to eventual bankruptcy with probability one.

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) affects 0. 5 - 1 % {{of population}} {{all over the}} world. As the duration of treatment is more in RA, patient′s adherence to treatment is less. Controlling {{the number of patients}} lost to follow-up is essential for the successful completion of randomized clinical trials. Also, patient adherence is critical in clinical trial setting as it has impact on validity of clinical data and also it remains an issue of utmost importance to pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as scientific and regulatory community. The studies which show reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trials are done for diseases like tuberculosis (TB). None of the study is available to find reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trials in RA. Hence, this study is planned. Aims and Objectives: Find reasons and effect of age, sex, duration of therapy, and distance <b>from</b> home on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis. Primary outcome are to find reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> trial.
