25|$|The {{facelift}} for the Corolla {{was launched}} on 11 April 2011. Initially only the XLi and GLi trims were available, with {{modifications to the}} front and rear lights, front grill, and bumpers, along with a revised interior colour scheme. The 1.8L Corolla Altis with 1ZZ-FE engine was suspended replaced with the 1.6L Corolla Altis with the 1ZR-FE engine producing 124bhp. The facelift Altis was launched in May 2011. The Altis comes equipped with sideskirts, wooden inserts in the interior, optitron speedometer, 5-spoke alloy rims, fog lamps, power windows, power seats, ABS <b>with</b> <b>EBD,</b> driver side SRS airbag and a 6-speed (forward) manual transmission. Optional on the Altis is a 4-speed super ECT automatic transmission and sunroof.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Holden Monaro from Australia) took place, {{effectively}} {{replacing the}} spot {{left by the}} Firebird and Camaro. The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in 2004. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Its clean lines and understated looks drew some criticism. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. Initial dealer mark ups, slow shipping transit from Australia, and lack of advertisement by GM were to blame. Due to the retirement of the LS1 engine in 2004, Pontiac added the drive-by-wire 400 HP LS2 V8 for 2005–2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette sourced PBR brakes <b>with</b> <b>EBD,</b> larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance, and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced {{as well as a}} Competition Group package (Comp G).|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with the}} {{blistering}} disease, epidermolysis bullosa (EB), frequently suffer from chronic wounds that become colonized by pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. To determine S. similar to aureus colonization rates in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB,</b> swabs {{were collected from}} the anterior nares, throats and wounds of 52 Dutch patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Swabs were also collected from nares and throats of 13 healthcare workers who occasionally meet the sampled patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> All <b>EB</b> patients <b>with</b> chronic wounds and 75 % of the patients without chronic wounds were colonized with S. similar to aureus. In contrast, 39 % of the sampled healthcare workers were colonized with S. similar to aureus. Typing revealed {{a high degree of}} genetic diversity of 184 collected S. similar to aureus isolates. Autoinoculation of S. similar to aureus in individual patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> was shown to occur frequently, whereas transmission of S. similar to aureus between patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> is apparently rare. There was no evidence for S. similar to aureus transmission between patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> and healthcare workers...|$|R

2500|$|Between 2000 and 2002, Volkswagen offered two {{sporting}} models — the 16V and GTI. The 16V {{came with}} the 1.4 litre16V [...] engine and had options such as 15" [...] Spa alloys and air conditioning. However, the GTI – available only in 3 or 5 door hatchback body styles in three colours being red, silver and black. Its power plant was a 1.6 litre16V [...] engine with variable valve timing. External changes included a deeper front splitter with honeycomb mesh grilles, lowered sports suspension (10mm), a subtle rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, fog lights, and 15" [...] BBS RXII split rims for the wheels bearing 195/45/15 tyres. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, xenon headlights with a headlight washer system, a six-disc CD autochanger with a GAMMA head unit, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel, handbrake and gearstick, chrome inserts, and driver aids such as ABS <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Polo GTI Mk3F however never got the new six-speed gearbox that {{was introduced in the}} smaller Volkswagen Lupo GTI which shared the same engine. Sadly, many of the Polo GTI 5 speed gearboxes fail due to faulty differential rivets and bearings which can only be rectified through a rebuild.|$|E

These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is {{heterogeneous}} {{group of}} rare heritable disorders characterised by blistering {{of the skin}} with minor trauma. Despite limited evidence to suggest patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> have more postoperative wound complications than the general population, we have noted reluctance among some surgeons to operate on these patients. We consequently designed this study to investigate postoperative wound healing in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Patients recruited from the Australian National Diagnostic Laboratory Database for EB and the Australasian EB Registry were posted the ‘Surgical Wound and Scar Healing in EB’ questionnaire which contains twenty-two questions about a patients experience of having surgery. Forty-six patients reported a total of 94 surgical procedures. The most frequent surgical procedure was the excision of a skin lesion, followed by musculoskeletal surgery, a caesarean section or an appendectomy. Five patients reported blistering at the surgical wound site after seven surgeries. Four patients reported four postoperative wound infections and one reported a postoperative wound dehiscence. Twenty patients had 34 postoperative wounds which they felt healed slower than someone without EB and 30 patients had 55 postoperative wounds which they felt healed {{at the same rate}} as someone without EB. After 67 surgeries, the postoperative scar was reported to heal flat and after 18 it was reported to heal as a keloid scar. It is unlikely that patients <b>with</b> localised <b>EB</b> simplex will develop blistering at postoperative wound site, but about a quarter of patients <b>with</b> generalised <b>EB</b> may develop blistering which is likely interfere with wound healing. Postoperative wound infections do not appear to occur any more frequently in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> than in patients within the general population and wound dehiscence is uncommon in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Postoperative wounds may heal at a similar or slower rate in patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> compared to those within the general population and patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> may have a propensity to develop keloid scars. Despite the inherent limitations of a postal survey we feel clinicians should be more confident to refer patients <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> for surgery and surgeons reassured about postoperative wound healing and complications...|$|R
5000|$|Students <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are {{a diverse}} population, {{and have a}} wide range of {{intellectual}} and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations. They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts, and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Students <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are often categorized as [...] "internalizers" [...] (e.g., have poor self-esteem, or are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder) or [...] "externalizers" [...] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with disruptive behavior disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students <b>with</b> <b>EBD</b> are also at an increased risk for learning disabilities, school dropout, substance abuse, and juvenile delinquency.|$|E

40|$|Background: Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) {{is a rare}} genetic condition, {{resulting}} in painful blistering of the skin. The two main specialised hospital services for those <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> are located in Dublin. Community services are provided nationally. The multi disciplinary team, who encourage a person’s occupational engagement, also deal with wound care, nutritional status, bathing regimes, pain management and psychological support for the client and family. Many professionals find that this possesses a variety of challenges. Objectives: As one component of innovative participatory action research exploring {{the development of a}} support service strategy for people <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> in Ireland, this study aimed to investigate the experiences and perceptions of Irish community service providers, working <b>with</b> people <b>with</b> <b>EB.</b> Methods: Semi-structured interviews sought to identify nine community service providers’ aims, interests and motives for service involvement, establish positive and challenging aspects of the system, and inform future service development. Results: Following thematic analysis, four themes emerged: 1) Aspects of Time, 2) Tools for Preparation, 3) Emotional Impact on Professionals, 4) Importance of Relationships Conclusions: The participants acknowledge the importance of building relationships of trust with the patients, their families and other professionals. Community service providers may only work with one or two people <b>with</b> <b>EB,</b> however the physical and emotional support required for this group needs to be fully understood and recognised. There is need for evidence-based, timely training and preparation, and continued supervision and support for these professionals, for them to do justice for people <b>with</b> <b>EB</b> in Ireland...|$|R
