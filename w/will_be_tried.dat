5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
5|$|For further {{elements}} up to 124, {{given that}} increasing the neutron number allows for {{getting closer to}} the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 that would confer stability, the use of weakly radioactive iron-60 instead of stable iron-58 as a projectile has been considered. 60Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years. The isotopes 299Ubu, 300Ubu, and 301Ubu that could be produced in these reactions via the 3n and 4n channels {{are expected to be}} the only reachable unbiunium isotopes with half-lives long enough for detection; the cross-sections would nevertheless push the limits of what can currently be detected. They would decay through isotopes of ununennium that could be produced by cross-bombardments in the 248Cm+51V or 249Bk+50Ti reactions, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> at RIKEN and JINR respectively in 2019–2020, down through known isotopes of tennessine and moscovium synthesised in the 249Bk+48Ca and 243Am+48Ca reactions. The multiplicity of excited states populated by the alpha decay of odd nuclei may however preclude clear cross-bombardment cases, as was seen in the purported yet likely nonexistent link between nuclides assigned to 293Ts and 289Mc. Heavier isotopes are expected to be more stable; 320Ubu is predicted to be the most stable unbiunium isotope, but {{there is no way to}} synthesise it with current technology as no combination of usable target and projectile could provide enough neutrons.|$|E

On 3 December, reports stated that Britain had demanded the right to speak to at least five Russians implicated in Litvinenko's death, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Moscow was willing to answer [...] "concrete questions."

500|$|Burnside {{offered to}} resign his {{commission}} altogether but Lincoln declined, stating {{that there could}} still {{be a place for}} him in the army. Thus, he was placed back {{at the head of the}} IX Corps and sent to command the Department of the Ohio, encompassing the states of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois. This was a quiet area with little activity, and the President reasoned that Burnside could not get himself into too much trouble there. However, antiwar sentiment was riding high in the Western states as they had traditionally carried on a great deal of commerce with the South, and there was little in the way of abolitionist sentiment there or a desire to fight for the purpose of ending slavery. Burnside was thoroughly disturbed by this trend and issued a series of orders forbidding [...] "the expression of public sentiments against the war or the Administration" [...] in his department; this finally climaxed with General Order No. 38, which declared that [...] "any person found guilty of treason <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> by a military tribunal and either imprisoned or banished to enemy lines".|$|E

500|$|The Enterprise is soon {{met by a}} Klingon battlecruiser, captained by Commander K'Nera (David Froman), who {{demands the}} return of the {{fugitive}} Klingons. Knowing that Korris and Konmel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>tried</b> and executed if they are returned, Worf argues instead for their exile to a hostile planet, but K'Nera refuses. Korris and Konmel use parts secreted on their uniforms to assemble a disruptor pistol and escape from the brig; Konmel is killed as Korris takes over the Engineering deck. Picard and Worf race to Engineering, and Worf tries to reason with Korris who is threatening to destroy the warp core and take the Enterprise with him. Korris attempts to persuade Worf to come with him and conquer the galaxy as a true Klingon and then accuses Worf of being weak when he refuses. Worf fires on Korris, killing him. K'Nera is told of the deaths of the fugitives, and Worf declares that they [...] "died well" [...] when asked of their manner of death. Worf agrees to consider an offer to serve aboard the Klingon battlecruiser after his service aboard the Enterprise is complete, but when communications with K'Nera are broken off, assures the bridge crew he was just being polite.|$|E

According to Time magazine, [...] "The hotel was soon surrounded by military. Fonseka complained that there was a threat to his life and that the government was limiting his movements.
