5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red <b>winter</b> <b>wheat</b> suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the gluten index is a widely used method for analysing the gluten strength of bread wheat and spring durum wheat genotypes. The present work was carried out to study {{the effect of the}} genotype, meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation and number of days with Tmax ≥ 30 °C) and agronomic treatments (N fertilisation and plant protection) on the gluten index of <b>winter</b> durum <b>wheat</b> varieties and breeding lines. The results indicated that the gluten index had little dependence on the environment, being determined to the greatest extent by the genotype. Compared with varieties having weak gluten, those with a strong gluten matrix responded less sensitively to changes in environmental conditions. Among the meteorological factors, high temperature {{at the end of the}} grain-filling period caused the greatest reduction in the mean gluten index of three varieties (R 2 = 0. 462), while the fertiliser was found to be a significant factor affecting the gluten strength of <b>winter</b> durum <b>wheat</b> varieties.

40|$|Abstract. Leaf rust, {{caused by}} Puccinia triticina, {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} disease of wheat in the US. On an annual basis, over 50 races of the leaf rust fungus are detected. There are at least 5 major groups of genetically distinct P. triticina isolates in the US based on allelic variation at microsatellite loci. Distinct regional race populations of P. triticina {{are found in the}} US, due to the widespread use of race-specific leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes in different market classes of wheat. In the south-eastern States where soft red <b>winter</b> <b>wheats</b> are grown, races with virulence to Lr 9, Lr 11, and Lr 18 are predominant. In the southern Great Plains region where hard red <b>winter</b> <b>wheats</b> are grown, races with virulence to genes Lr 9, Lr 17, Lr 24, and Lr 26 are common. In the northern Great Plains region where hard red spring wheats are grown, races with virulence to Lr 2 a and Lr 16 are common. Due to the wide dispersal of P. triticina, some races are found in all regions of the US. Highly effective durable resistance to leaf rust has been difficult to achieve due to the high degree of virulence variation in the P. triticina population and the rapid selection of races with virulence to effective Lr genes in wheat cultivars. Hard red spring wheat cultivars with genes Lr 16, Lr 23, and Lr 34 have been highly resistant for more than 10 years in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Stem rust, caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici, has not been a common disease of wheat in the US since the last major epidemics in the 1950 s. The low levels of stem rust infections in the US {{can be attributed to the}} increasing use of highly resistant <b>winter</b> and spring <b>wheat</b> cultivars, which has greatly reduced the overall level of stem rust urediniospores. Eradication of the alternate host, Berberis vulgaris, has reduced the number of race...|$|R

25|$|Wheat is {{a staple}} crop from Canada.
