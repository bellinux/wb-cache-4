She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and {{can be seen as}} inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the Little Busters is Masato Inohara <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud. Masato's rival and fellow member of the Little Busters is Kengo Miyazawa who is skilled in the art of kendo and seemingly has a cynical personality, but his passion for the Little Busters is unmatched by any of the other members.|$|E

500|$|The module {{begins with}} a prologue {{explaining}} that giants of different types have been raiding lands occupied by humans. Angered by this, the human rulers hire a group of adventurers (the player characters) to [...] "punish the miscreant giants." [...] The players' party is informed that they must defeat the giants, or have their heads placed on the chopping block. The human nobles equip the party with weapons and horses, along with a guide and a map that shows {{the location of the}} hill giants. The players are informed that the hill giants are led by Nosnra, a sly hill giant chieftain <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> set up ambushes; there is an unknown force binding together different giant groups. The player characters are informed that they may keep any spoils they find, but must return at once if they determine what [...] "sinister hand" [...] is behind the alliance.|$|E

[...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine named it a [...] "strutting arena rock" [...] song, while Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic simply called it [...] "great." [...] The New York Times editor Kelefa Sanneh positively viewed the track's theme as [...] "fearless" [...] and [...] "full of mildly rebellious rhetoric." [...] On a less positive side, BBC Music's Jacqueline Hodges called the song [...] "hilarious", while Jancee Dunn from Rolling Stone wrote that the song [...] "is a sterile foray into rock." ...|$|E

500|$|AJ is a mechanic, who is {{described}} as a [...] who [...] "never misses an opportunity for excitement." [...] He is characterised as a free-spirited, fun-loving and carefree rebel, who does not always realise how his spontaneity affects other people. He {{is described}} as cheeky, irresponsible, a bad influence, a joker, a charmer and a talker. It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him, is fun to be around and could be running away from life. A writer for the BBC said that he lives [...] "like there's no tomorrow", and makes decisions {{based on the results of}} a coin flip. The coin, described as [...] "lucky", is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay, in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin, though one friend does not know that both sides of the coin are the same. Ganatra stated in an interview on This Morning that he did not think that the two sides of AJ's coin were the same. Sharma described AJ as [...] "the clown <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> play" [...] and [...] "a little bit of a hippy", saying [...] "he's got a real wheeler-dealer, Del Boy aspect to his character." [...] He has twice compared AJ to a puppy dog, because he is nice but annoying, and he is fun but a nuisance. Sharma, who was brought up in Newport, said that [...] "the charm, humour and personality" [...] of Welsh people he knew helped him to create the character of AJ.|$|E
500|$|All Ballantyne's novels are, {{in his own}} words, [...] "adventure {{stories for}} young folks", and The Coral Island is no exception. It is a Robinsonade, a genre of fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), {{one of the most}} popular of its type, and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. Susan Maher, professor of English, [...] notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original's romance with a [...] "pedestrian realism", exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat's 1841 novel Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific. Romance, with its attention to character development, was only restored to the genre of boys' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker. The Coral Island, for all its adventure, is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction (the domain of the realist novel); Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys' living arrangements. The book exhibits a [...] "light-hearted confidence" [...] in its description of an adventure that was above all fun. As Ralph says in his preface: [...] "If there is any boy or man <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away. It is not meant for him." [...] Professor of English [...] has observed that [...] "the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children's fantasy".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E

500|$|After Cassie's parents {{leave for}} a Halloween party and later that night, The Evil Thing {{is brought to}} life by Max's thoughts, and captures him, Priscilla and a Papa John's Pizza {{delivery}} man. It is up to Cassie and Sean (Cody Linley), a popular boy who Cassie likes, to save them. At first, they try to defeat The Evil Thing on their own, but fail. Cassie then asks {{the owner of the}} shop, where she bought the book, for help. Cassie discovers that the store owner travels around the world each Halloween, searching for a person <b>who</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> scare people the most and tricks them into reading the book aloud, releasing The Evil Thing, possibly in order to teach them a lesson. He leaves them with the riddle [...] "two heads are better than one; that's the way to get the bloody job done" [...] before his shop disappears. After he disappears, Sean solves the riddle. Together, they formulate that if they get blood from a roast that Cassie's mother made and throw it onto The Evil Thing, it will be forced to suck up the blood. In doing so, it will devour itself. [...] While they plan their attack, The Evil Thing's babies hatch and tries to eat the victims. Luckily, Sean and Cassie make it in time. By using Sean's CD of monster sound effects, they are able to lure the monster to the CD player; however, when the monster nudges it, the music turns into hip hop, thus ruining their plan. While fumbling, Sean and Cassie accidentally drop the blood near Max, who must conquer his fears. When Cassie encourages him, Max tosses the blood onto The Evil Thing, causing its heads to begin attacking each other. The monster eats itself, eventually exploding in a shower of yellow blood, killing itself and its offspring.|$|E
