500|$|The lyrics in {{the song}} are cryptic; The ending lines of the third verse emphasise in belief and assurance: [...] "If {{you could see it}} then you'd understand/ah, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> then you'll understand," [...] and [...] "Some things you have to believe/others are puzzles puzzling me." [...] The fourth line in the second verse alludes to {{discovering}} your place in the world: [...] "How long am I gonna stand/with my head stuck under the sand." ...|$|E
500|$|Tibbitt {{said that}} the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] {{for him in the}} new title {{sequence}} was [...] "the treatment of Painty the Pirate in the beginning" [...] as seen in a fortune teller machine. Mark Caballero, one of its animators, explained [...] "our idea was like our goal is like the more disturbing, the better because I don't think there is a fortune telling machine out there that doesn't disturb <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Tibbitt said [...] "it was a great idea I was just expecting maybe a 3D version of the painting but we got something totally different and it's very cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E

500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E
500|$|The artwork for Follow the Leader {{was done}} by Todd McFarlane Entertainment, with McFarlane and fellow Image Comics artists Greg Capullo (penciller) and Brian Hagelin (colorist) doing the album cover, and {{designer}} Brent Ashe handling the graphics work. According to drummer David Silveria, the band got interested in McFarlane after hearing that [...] "Todd had actually referred to us as 'the Doors of the 90's'", leading to them recording a song for Spawn, a film based on a comic book by McFarlane, and eventually approaching the artist to make an album cover for them. The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff. They're {{the most beautiful thing}} in the world, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in our artwork, the way we've placed it, it's just kinda fuckin' weird." [...] The [...] "Freak on a Leash" [...] music video features animated segments by McFarlane featuring this cover art.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

2500|$|Science {{fiction is}} {{difficult}} to define, and includes {{a wide range of}} subgenres and themes. Author and editor Damon Knight summed up the difficulty, saying [...] "science fiction is what we point to when we say it", a definition echoed by author Mark C. Glassy, who argues that the definition of science fiction is like the definition of pornography: you do not know what it is, but you know it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oshii noted his {{attention}} to detail might be particularly Japanese: [...] "I get absorbed in the finer points [...] like what {{the back of a}} bottle label looks like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> through the glass [...] That's very Japanese, I suppose. I want people {{to go back to the}} film again and again to pick up things they missed the first time." [...] Describing the overall look, the director said, [...] "The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. And as I said, there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at some of the things I liked as a child — the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world — not a future world." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and {{was not the first}} benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal's Highbury ground had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on {{towards the end of the}} first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to [...] "Keep your eye on the ball, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> coming keep low. The batsmen will try to keep it down but they can't promise." [...] The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: [...] "What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?" ...|$|E
