5|$|The track route {{was built}} under {{supervision}} of Sigurd Lund and Carl Venderboe in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by Cattani. The only fixed installation was a <b>water</b> <b>main</b> which {{ran along the}} track, using Øvresetertjern as its water source. Engineer Luigi Angelini from Switzerland was hired to supervise {{the construction of the}} curves, which cost NOK615,000. The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and then for the Olympics in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the <b>water</b> <b>main,</b> and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, works was {{undertaken}} to protect or relocate {{sections of the}} Canning Trunk <b>water</b> <b>main</b> and the Dampier to Bunbury Natural Gas Pipeline {{in the vicinity of}} the project. Construction on the Gateway WA project officially began on 1 February 2013 with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the state and federal transport ministers, Troy Buswell and Anthony Albanese. The whole project was due to be completed by 2017. However it was moved to March 2016, due to construction moving faster than expected. Works were finished on April 12, 2016.|$|E

There are six swing bridges; four bascule bridges, {{two of which}} have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift bridges, which are a type of rolling bascule bridge. Scott Street Bridge, which is now permanently raised, was originally powered from a high pressure <b>water</b> <b>main</b> maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement {{at the end of}} the tunnel {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a <b>water</b> <b>main</b> to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the middle of the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|The two {{aftershocks}} {{the following}} morning were separated by less than four hours and both caused {{at least as much}} damage as the mainshock. A large fire was triggered following the first aftershock at a shopping center in Scotia that destroyed four businesses, with the resulting damage at that site alone estimated at $15 million, and was the largest individual financial misfortune of the sequence of earthquakes. The water supply in Rio Dell was terminated when the <b>water</b> <b>main</b> was severed at the abutment to the Eel River bridge and power outages were widespread throughout Humboldt County. Some were mere seconds while others lasted for hours, but the hydroelectric plant's performance at Ruth Reservoir was deemed acceptable, and power that was not generated locally was unaffected.|$|E

The couple were taken to the Regent's Park Nursing Home, where Lottie died two days later. He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel, where he had a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in southern England; in Bournemouth he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett, a hotel manageress, and the couple married in October in the following year.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{the city}} {{experienced}} {{an average of}} at least one <b>water</b> <b>main</b> break per day. Between 2005 and 2015, the city suffered 2,000 <b>water</b> <b>main</b> breaks. Mayor Stephanie Miner estimated of the cost to fix the city's water infrastructure at $1billion over a 10-15 year period. On February 25, 2015, Miner testified before a joint hearing of the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee and state Senate Finance Committee.

The nearly four-hour rush of water caused damage to buildings and athletic facilities, including Pauley Pavilion and the Wooden Center. In addition, several parking structures were partially inundated, trapping nearly 740 cars.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{improvements}} to Woodland Cemetery {{were made in}} {{the last decade of the}} 19th century. In 1888, a small wooden, enclosed pavilion was erected on the ground to provide employees with a place to eat and store tools. A fence was erected around the cemetery's stoneyard to screen it from view, a stone path was built from the Woodland Avenue gatehouse to the chapel, and all walks were cindered. The central <b>water</b> <b>main</b> was replaced, and a public drinking fountain added near the chapel. The chapel's receiving vault was updated to accommodate a trend toward larger caskets, box gutters were installed throughout the cemetery to replace ditch gutters, and the two gatekeeper's houses and the foreman's house were both repaired and refurbished. In 1889, the chapel was connected to the <b>water</b> <b>main</b> for the first time. Due to limited burial space, two grassy areas around the chapel were converted into burial plots.|$|E
25|$|On March 3, the 100th <b>water</b> <b>main</b> {{break in}} Syracuse in 2015 {{occurred}} on James Street. Early in 2015, Miner lobbied {{the state for}} funding to fix the city's aging water system. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declined to help, stating that the city should improve its economy and increase tax revenues, which would enable the city to fund their own water pipe repairs.|$|E

However, as this was prohibited due to the historic importance of the place, Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music ensemble Tingluti in 1978. As a consequence of a burst <b>water</b> <b>main</b> which they could not afford to repair, Tingluti had to sell the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen.

25|$|Originally {{built as}} a depot for cable trams which ran up Brixton Hill in 1892, it was re-built between 1904-06 for use by {{electric}} trams. In 1993 it was extended onto a site formerly owned by the water board and containing a large <b>water</b> <b>main,</b> and then in 1949 reconstruction started to bury the main and convert the depot into one large building instead of two smaller ones. The last trams ran from the depot in 1951, by which time AEC Regent III RTs had started to arrive with the last remaining until 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Tibitoc water {{production}} plant, {{located in}} the suburbs of Bogota, supplies almost 30% of Bogota's residents. To ensure continuous water supply, a rehabilitation project of the water plant and water mains was carried out. This is a 20-year project that began in 1998. An investment of US$22 million over three years was made by Veolia Water Solutions & Technologies to rehabilitate the entire water treatment process including physical pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration, neutralization and disinfection. Additionally, there was an investment of US$35 million to rehabilitate the Tibitoc water production plant <b>water</b> <b>main</b> lines. Other improvements were made to operating guidelines and the monitoring of the facility.|$|E

25|$|Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 {{to the nearby}} 52-story Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) on 9 September 2010. The shuttle emerged from OPF-3 at 06:54 EDT and the {{rollover}} was done at 10:46 EDT when Discovery came to a rest in the VAB's transfer aisle. The quarter-mile trip between the OPF-3 and VAB was the 41st rollover for Discovery. The rollover was originally planned at 06:30 EDT on 8 September 2010. The move did not commence due to the unavailability of fire suppression systems because of a broken <b>water</b> <b>main</b> near the VAB and turn basin that runs out to the shuttle launch pads.|$|E
25|$|The TPA {{conducted}} a private environmental {{assessment of the}} project and decided to proceed in April 2011. The TPA then short-listed three companies to respond to a request for proposals to build the tunnel. The RFP ended in October 2011. In July 2011, an agreement was reached with the City of Toronto, exchanging lands with the Port Authority, enabling the Port Authority to proceed on the pedestrian tunnel. The agreement allows the Port Authority to expand their taxi and parking space for the airport. In exchange, the City of Toronto had a <b>water</b> <b>main</b> to serve the Islands included as part of the project. In January 2012, the TPA announced that ground-breaking would take place in February 2012, with construction to take approximately two years.|$|E
25|$|Construction on {{the section}} between West 9th and 19th Streets began in early 1961, but work was halted by a <b>water</b> <b>main</b> break, {{and with other}} delays the work was only twenty percent {{complete}} in July 1963. Construction on the section between West 19th and 31st Streets started {{in the middle of}} 1961, and was 60 percent complete in July 1963. The first section was 88 percent complete on June 30, 1965, and the second section was 99 percent complete on that date. Between West 55th and 58th Street, a third of the structural work was done by this date. No stations were constructed along the new express tracks, but provisions were incorporated into the design of the tunnel to permit the addition of future lower level stations at 14th Street and 23rd Street without disturbances to train operation.|$|E
