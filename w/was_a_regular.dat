5|$|Al Jaffe, ESPN's vice {{president}} for talent, brought Scott to ESPN2 because {{they were looking for}} sportscasters who might appeal to a younger audience. Scott became one of the few African-American personalities who was not a former professional athlete. His first ESPN assignments were for SportsSmash, a short sportscast twice an hour on ESPN2's SportsNight program. After Keith Olbermann left SportsNight for ESPN's SportsCenter, Scott took his place in the anchor chair at SportsNight. After this, Scott <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> on SportsCenter. At SportsCenter, Scott was frequently teamed with fellow anchors Steve Levy, Kenny Mayne, Dan Patrick, and most notably, Rich Eisen.

40|$|Abstract: <b>A</b> ring R <b>is</b> called <b>a</b> (von Neumann) <b>regular</b> ring if {{for every}} x 2 R; x = xyx for some y 2 R. It is {{well-known}} that for any ring R and any positive integer n, the full matrix ring Mn(R) is regular if {{and only if}} R <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> ring. This paper examines this property on any additively commutative semiring S with zero. The regularity of S is dened analogously. We show that for a positive integer n, if Mn(S) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring, then S <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring but the converse need not be true for n = 2. And for n 3, Mn(S) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> semiring {{if and only if}} S <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> ring...|$|R
