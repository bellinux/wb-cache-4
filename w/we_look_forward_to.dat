500|$|It {{was created}} {{on the same}} engine as [...] Game {{developer}} Heavy Iron Studios tweaked the graphics to give the game a sharper and more-imaginative look than Battle for Bikini Bottom. It increased the polygon count, added several racing levels and incorporated many creatures from the film. The game's plot {{was based on the}} film, with SpongeBob and Patrick on a mission taking them outside Bikini Bottom to retrieve Neptune's crown.

500|$|Having {{claimed the}} {{election}} was entirely without irregularities, the United States government hailed Diệm as a new hero of the [...] "free world".

[...] Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators. Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the negative image created by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion. The US State Department spokesman said [...] "the people of Viet-Nam have spoken, and we, of course, recognise their decision".
