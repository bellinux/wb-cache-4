In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E

With the introduction of the T-1 series subway trains, the H-1 and H-2 subway trains were retired from service, while the remaining H-4 trains (along with some earlier T-1 series trains) were shifted to the Bloor–Danforth line.|$|E

5|$|During {{preparations}} for the , Ron Dennis, the McLaren CEO and Chairman, noted that the team was encouraged by the aerodynamic data they had collected on the chassis, particularly its mid-corner speeds which he claimed <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those produced by other teams. He further added that the car's performance issues could {{be traced back to}} a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car could make up several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E
5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats.

In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein observed that the bluebuck's habitat preferences <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of the Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E

Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that <b>were</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
