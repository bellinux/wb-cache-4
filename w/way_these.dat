The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E

Another <b>way</b> <b>these</b> groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
