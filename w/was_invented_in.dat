5|$|Limonana, {{a type of}} {{lemonade}} {{made from}} freshly-squeezed lemons and mint, <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> Israel in the early 1990s {{and has become a}} summer staple throughout the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Wok: The {{cast-iron}} Wok <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> China {{during the}} Han dynasty. The round-bottomed cooking vessel {{is central to}} Chinese cooking and soon spread to other Asian culinary spheres due to its unique concave shape and ability to sear food at a fast pace.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> {{part as a}} {{means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E

5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> {{the context}} of the chivalrous pastimes of the court, by an Italian, and a Medici, the Queen Mother. Many poets, artists, musicians, choreographers, contributed to the result, but it was she who was the inventor, one might perhaps say, the producer; she who had the ladies of her court trained to perform these ballets in {{settings}} of her devising.|$|E
5|$|Luisa Valenzuela's The Lizard's Tail (Cola de lagartija, 1983) {{is set in}} {{the period}} after Juan Perón's return to Argentina in 1973, when the Argentine {{president}} was heavily influenced by the sinister éminence grise José López Rega. The novel deals specifically with themes surrounding the nature of male-female relationships during this regime of military oppression. The novel's title is a reference to an instrument of torture that <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Cone.|$|E

5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{was first}} {{created in the}} early twentieth century after marshmallow creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> Massachusetts. During World War I, a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.|$|E
5|$|A pancake {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known pancake machine <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty pancake machine in 2013 in commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> China {{no later}} than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E

5|$|Many other symbols {{have been}} {{proposed}} for addition {{to the list of}} official state symbols but were never officially adopted. Since 1971, the white-tailed deer has been proposed as the state mammal eight times. Other creatures proposed as representations of the state have included the northern leopard frog, the eastern timber wolf, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, and the Blanding's turtle. In 2007, another proposal, also unsuccessful, was to designate the Tilt-A-Whirl as the state's official amusement ride. It <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> Faribault in 1926, and debuted at the Minnesota State Fair a year later.|$|E
5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E

5|$|Pound lock: Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that pound locks {{may have been used}} in antiquity by the Ptolemaic Greeks and the Romans. In China, although the one gate canal flash lock existed beforehand, the two-gate pound lock <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> 984 by an official of Huainan and engineer named Qiao Weiyo, during the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), so that ships could safely travel along canal waterways having gated and segmented chambers where water levels could be regulated. The economic and transport benefits of this innovation were described by the polymath official and inventor Shen Kuo (1031–1095) in his Dream Pool Essays.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang period {{employed}} complex chemical formulas for {{an array}} of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain <b>was</b> <b>invented</b> <b>in</b> China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.|$|E
