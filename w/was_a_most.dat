Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E
5|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots {{which he used}} to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

50|$|When {{a system}} of {{definitions}} is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions {{can be thought of}} as nodes forming a hierarchy or—more generally—a directed acyclic graph; a node that has no predecessor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> general definition; each node along <b>a</b> directed path <b>is</b> more differentiated (or more derived) than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no successor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> differentiated (or <b>a</b> <b>most</b> derived) definition.|$|R
25|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> liberal-minded man, both in {{politics}} and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher. He took great interest in the struggle of the Greeks for independence, and strongly favoured the appointment of the notorious David Strauss to the chair of dogmatic theology at Zürich, {{which led to the}} disturbance of September 6, 1839 and the fall of the liberal government.|$|E

He took 224 wickets for Glamorgan, with a best of 8 for 93, at 37.53. He took 5 wickets in an innings four times. In all first-class cricket, including a game for the MCC and H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, he scored 15,964 runs at 24.4 in 406 matches, and took 230 wickets at 37.7 each.|$|E
25|$|Origen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> {{prolific}} writeraccording to Epiphanius of Salamis, {{he wrote}} about 6,000 booksmaking it a difficult task to define the central core of his teachings. The original Greek text of his main theological work De Principiis only survives in fragments, while a 5th-century Latin translation was cleared of controversial teachings by Tyrannius Rufinus, making it hard for modern scholars to rebuild Origen's original thoughts. Thus, {{it is unclear whether}} reincarnation and the pre-existence of souls formed part of Origen's beliefs.|$|E

25|$|A brief {{instance}} {{after the}} foundation of Zubarah, two screening walls were constructed from the outer town wall toward Qal'at Murair. These two walls, oriented east-west, include round towers placed at regular intervals, which strengthened their defensive capabilities. The screening walls likely served to secure the transportation {{of water from the}} wells inside Qal'at Murair to Zubarah. In the harsh, hot summers of the Persian Gulf, water <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> valuable and beneficial commodity. The walls also channeled general traffic to and fro the town over open salt flats.|$|E
25|$|Since {{his death}} White has been {{described}} as a satyr. To answer this by saying that he was a great architect is not to answer at all…what is more important is that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> kindhearted, most considerate, gentle and manly man, who could no more have done the things attributed to him than he could have roasted a baby on a spit. Big in mind and in body, he was incapable of little meanness. He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.|$|E
25|$|Tītokowaru, who {{had fought}} in the Second Taranaki War, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> skilful West Coast Māori warrior. He also assumed the roles of a priest and prophet of the extremist Hauhau {{movement}} of the Pai Mārire religion, reviving ancient rites of cannibalism and propitiation of Māori gods with the human heart torn from the first slain in a battle. Although Tītokowaru's forces were numerically small and initially outnumbered in battle 12 to one by government troops, the ferocity of their attacks provoked fear among settlers and prompted the resignation and desertion of many militia volunteers, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of most government military forces from South Taranaki and giving Tītokowaru control of almost all the territory between New Plymouth and Wanganui.|$|E

25|$|His {{writings}} cover {{a number}} of fields. Among his more pretentious works are: A Digest of All the Reported Cases... of Conn. (2 vols., 1871, 1882), Cases on Railroad Law (1896), Modern Political Institutions (1898), American Railroad Law (1904), The American Judiciary (1905), The Relations of Education to Citizenship (1912), Life and Letters of Simeon Baldwin (1919), The Young Man and the Law (1919). He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> prolific writer of articles and pamphlets. Some ten years before his death he collected and presented to the Yale Law School nearly a hundred of these in four bound volumes which he entitled in order of numbering: Law and Law Reform, Studies in History, International and Constitutional Law, and Studies in Legal Education and Social Sciences. While these titles very aptly classify his literary output the volumes themselves do not contain all his miscellaneous publications.|$|E
25|$|The new Methil dock {{was entirely}} successful, and {{mechanical}} handling equipment and other modern aids ensured rapid loading of shipping. Nonetheless Wemyss {{did not wish to}} be a long term operator of harbour facilities, particularly because he foresaw that considerable development would be needed in later years to keep abreast of the expansion of trade. Discussions took place with the North British Railway in 1888 which resulted in the sale of the facilities to that company. This became effective on 1 February 1889 and included the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and the Methil extension, the Methil and Leven docks, and the railways serving them. Wemyss undertook never to construct or allow a railway or dock on his lands that would compete with the transferred lines and harbours. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> significant concession, as he was handing monopoly control to the NBR; at the time he had an excellent relationship with the Chairman of the NBR, John Walker, and this may have influenced him. The purchase cost £225,000; the Wemyss Castle station was to be maintained by the NBR for the private use of Wemyss, and Wemyss was given a seat on the NBR board.|$|E
25|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>most</b> unusual wicket-keeper - {{along with}} Clyde Walcott {{probably}} the tallest to regularly play this position - and his clumsy build suggested a {{complete lack of}} style behind the stumps. His debut behind the stumps came {{in one of the}} most remarkable county matches of all time. When Northamptonshire played Surrey at Northampton in 1920 the match produced 1,475 runs (a championship record which stood for nearly seventy years), including a century in around 35 minutes by Percy Fender. Bellamy's first victim was Jack Hobbs, and he conceded only 11 byes as Surrey totalled 619-5 declared and 120-2. Initially he was not regarded as a serious batsman, but as early as 1922 Bellamy scored his career best batting total of 168 against an admittedly weak Worcestershire bowling attack. Three years later, after Northamptonshire lost eight wickets for 216 he put on 93 with Phillip Wright for the ninth wicket and with fellow Wollaston boy Vernon Murdin 148 runs for the last wicket against Glamorgan, which is still a county record. Bellamy reached his peak in 1928, when he scored 1,116 runs with two centuries, but injury and age gradually began to catch up with him in the 1930s. He missed the last eighteen games of 1931 and never reached the same records he had in the previous decade during his last four seasons with the side.|$|E
