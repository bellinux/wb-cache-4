5|$|The 2012 Ford Focus Electric {{was planned}} to include <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> for pedestrians. Ford Motor Company {{developed}} four alternative sounds, and in June 2011 involved the electric car fans by {{asking them to}} pick their favorite from the four potential <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> through the Focus Electric Facebook page. However, ultimately Ford decided to hold off including <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> unless federal legislation required it, and no such system was implemented on the production vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Electric vehicle <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> are {{a series}} of sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to be aware of their presence. <b>Warning</b> <b>sounds</b> may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E
5|$|General Motors' first commercially {{available}} plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, introduced in December 2010, includes <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> for pedestrians.

5|$|Predators may {{identify}} their prey by sound {{as well as}} sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce <b>warning</b> <b>sounds.</b> Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system will only increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|Some carmakers {{announced}} they {{have decided to}} address this safety issue, and as a result, the new Nissan Leaf electric car and Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, both launched in December 2010, {{as well as the}} Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid launched in 2011 launched in 2012, include electric <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> to alert pedestrians, the blind and others to their presence. , most of the hybrids and plug-in electric and hybrids available in the United States, Japan and Europe make warning noises using a speaker system. The Tesla Model S {{is one of the few}} electric cars without <b>warning</b> <b>sounds,</b> because Tesla Motors will await until regulations are enacted. Volkswagen and BMW also decided to add artificial sounds to their electric drive cars only when required by regulation.|$|E

50|$|The Karma has a <b>warning</b> <b>sound</b> system {{designed}} to both alert pedestrians of its presence and enhance the driver experience. The sound is emitted through a pair of external speakers embedded in the bumper, and the sound-generator was developed by Fisker Automotive.

5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. <b>Warning</b> <b>sounds</b> include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{rear-end}} collision warning system {{is prone to}} give false positive warnings, which can interfere with the driver's concentration while driving, and very often, the high pitched <b>warning</b> <b>sound</b> used in these systems {{is found to be}} annoying, and drivers tend to turn the system function off. As a result, this research mainly focused on showing how human beings learn and behave unconsciously, and how a <b>warning</b> <b>sound</b> can be effective without being high pitched. This paper validates the effect of an inconspicuous alarm or <b>warning</b> <b>sound,</b> by testing on a driving simulator. The test subjects learned the false positive warning generation pattern also unconsciously, and they applied the brake quickly only in case of imminent danger...|$|R

500|$|A {{proposed}} {{rule was}} published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling {{at less than}} [...] to emit <b>warning</b> <b>sounds</b> that pedestrians {{must be able to}} hear over background noises. The agency selected 30km/h as the limit because according to NHTSA measurements, this is the speed at which the sound levels of the hybrid and electric vehicles [...] approximated the sound levels produced by similar internal combustion vehicles. According to the NHTSA proposal, carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. The NHTSA estimates that the new warning noises would prevent 2,800 pedestrian and cyclist injuries during the life of each model year electric and hybrid vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{significant}} noise reduction typical of electric vehicles that travel at low speeds, the 2011 Leaf includes digital <b>warning</b> <b>sounds,</b> one for forward motion {{and another for}} reverse, to alert pedestrians, the blind, and others of its presence.

Nissan explained that during the development of the sound, they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists. The sine-wave sound system sweeps from 2.5kHz at the high end to a low of 600Hz, an easily audible range across age groups. Depending on the speed and if the Leaf is accelerating or decelerating, the sound system makes sweeping, high-low sounds. The sound system ceases operation when the Nissan Leaf reaches [...] and engages again as car slows to under [...] For the 2011 model, the driver could turn off sounds temporarily through a switch inside the vehicle, but the system automatically reset to [...] "On" [...] at the next ignition cycle. The system is controlled through a computer and synthesizer in the dash panel, and the sound is delivered through a speaker in the front driver’s side wheel well. Nissan removed the ability to disable the pedestrian alert between model year 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of the U.S. ruling to be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.|$|E
