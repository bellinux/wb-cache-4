Who {{would ever}} have thought of a {{domestic}} couple like you going on such a lark as this. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> about it from old John, and we came down {{to see what you}} are up to. You've got everything very nice. I think I'd like this myself. Why, you might have a rifle-range out here. You could cut down those bushes {{on the other side of}} the creek, and put up your target over there on that hill. Then you could lie down here on the grass and bang away all day. If you'll do that, I'll come down and practice with you. How long are you going to keep it up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{apply to}} the Turks,--afflicted Polish Patriots prostrating {{themselves}} {{with the hope of}} despair, [...] "Save us, your sublime Clemency; throw a ray of pity on us, Brother of the Sun and Moon: oh, chastise our diabolic oppressors!"--this {{was one of the first}} resources of the Bar Confederates. The Turks did give ear; not inattentive, though pretending to be rather deaf. M. de Vergennes,--of whose [...] "diplomatic bellows" [...] <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> (in fact, for diligence in this Turk element, in this young time, the like of him was seldom seen; we knew him long afterwards as a diligent old gentleman, in French-Revolution days),--M. de Vergennes zealously supports; zealous to let loose the Turk upon Anti-French parties. The Turks seem to wag their heads, for some time; and their responses are ambiguous. For some time, not for long. Here, fast enough, comes, in disguised shape, the Catastrophe itself, ye poor plaintive Poles! ...|$|E

"We hurried off, like fools, quite {{inflated}} {{with our}} Victory, to try {{if we could}} not chase the Austrians out of Dresden: they made a mockery of us from the tops of their mountains. So I have withdrawn, like a bad little boy, to conceal myself, out of spite, {{in one of the}} wretchedest villages in Saxony. And here the first thing will be to drive the Circle gentlemen, [Reichs Army] out of Freyberg into Chemnitz, and get ourselves room to quarter and something to live upon. It is, I swear to you, a dog of a life [or even a she-dog, CHIENNE DE VIE], the like of which nobody but Don Quixote ever led before me. All this tumbling and toiling, and bother and confusion that never ceases, has made me so old, that you would scarcely know me again. On the right side of my head the hair is all gray; my teeth break and fall out; I have got my face wrinkled like the falbalas of a petticoat; my back bent like a fiddle-bow; and spirit sad and downcast like a monk of La Trappe. I forewarn you of all this, lest, in case we should meet again in flesh and bone, you might feel yourself too violently shocked by my appearance. There remains to me nothing but the heart,--which has undergone no change, and which will preserve, so long as I breathe, its feelings of esteem and of tender friendship for my good Mamma. Adieu."

5000|$|One of the survivors, Zarfa Turkovic, {{described}} {{the horrors of}} rapes as follows: [...] "Two soldiers took her legs and raised {{them up in the}} air, while the third began raping her.

They put a rag into her mouth and then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> silent sobs...." ...|$|E
50|$|Semantic {{processing}} is {{the processing}} that occurs after {{we hear a}} word and encode its meaning. Semantic processing causes us to relate the word <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> to other words with similar meanings. Once a word is perceived, it is placed in a context mentally that allows for a deeper processing. Therefore, semantic processing produces memory traces that last longer than those produced by shallow processing since shallow processing produces fragile memory traces that decay rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|The Bicentennial Minute {{achieved}} a high cultural profile during its run and was widely referenced and parodied. For example, in the All in the Family episode [...] "Mike's Move" [...] (originally broadcast on February 2, 1976), the character Mike Stivic {{responded to a}} typical monologue by his father-in-law Archie Bunker {{about the history of}} American immigration and the meaning of the Statue of Liberty with the sarcastic comment: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> Archie Bunker's Bicentennial Minute."

5000|$|We cannot say: {{creation}} or evolution, {{inasmuch as}} these two things respond to two different realities. The {{story of the}} dust {{of the earth and}} the breath of God, which <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> does not in fact explain how human persons come to be but rather what they are. It explains their inmost origin and casts light on the project that they are. And, vice versa, the theory of evolution seeks to understand and describe biological developments. But in so doing it cannot explain where the 'project' of human persons comes from, nor their inner origin, nor their particular nature. To that extent we are faced here with two complementary—rather than mutually exclusive—realities.

5000|$|One {{incident}} {{in particular was}} described in moderate detail by musician Dean London recording {{in the studio with}} Pretty. [...] " [...] After we recorded the guitar track and paused for a break, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> this giant knocking. It was really loud, even inside the mixing booth. For some reason, there was this giant replica medieval sword that Robert always had laying around in the corner. He grabbed the damn thing and stormed out {{the back door of the}} studio with the sword held over his head like some kind of enraged barbarian. I guess he thought it was some kids.... that he was going to run up and scare them so they would stop knocking and we could get back to recording. Needless to say, it wasn't the neighborhood youth, it was the police with a noise pollution violation. Let's just say Robert is lucky to still be alive." ...|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{learning}} from Bacharach and David the label didn't think her style was correct {{for their new}} song, and that Jerry Butler was selected for recording it, a keenly disappointed Warwick felt used, manipulated and exploited, and dismissed the team's assurance of writing her an equally viable song in her own style. According to a Biography cable television episode featuring Burt Bacharach, Warwick responded by shouting, in nearly a crying rant, at the songwriters {{as she left the}} recording studio: [...] "Don't make me over, man [...] [...] [...] (you have to) accept me for what I am". Bacharach and David looked at each other in the moment, in stunned disbelief, at her youthful outburst at them. David said to Bacharach: [...] "Burt, I think <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> the title of a new song". David, never to waste life's circumstances and moments as inspiration for a song, in fact went to work on lyrics and utilized Warwick's authentic energetic outburst as the title and sentiment for [...] "Don't Make Me Over", shifting the meaning of the phrase to [...] "Accept me for what I am" [...] and adding the phrase [...] "Accept me for the things that I do".|$|E
