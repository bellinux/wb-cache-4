5|$|In 1920, American {{botanist}} Paul C. Standley described {{three new}} species based on collections from Panama and Costa Rica—Ficus tuerckheimii, F. isophlebia and F. jimenezii. DeWolf {{concluded that they}} <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> same species, and Berg synonymised them with F. aurea. These names have been used widely for Mexican and Central American populations, {{and continue to be}} used by some authors. Berg suspected that Ficus rzedowskiana Carvajal and Cuevas-Figueroa may also belong to this species, but he had not examined the original material upon which this species was based.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, nearby nuclear weapons testing by the United States {{military}} accidentally caused {{all of the}} islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique ecosystem.

The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner {{in his capacity as}} the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to {{serve as the basis for}} illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.|$|E

5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the charitable institution, Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E
5|$|Subordinate to the MVM <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> diocesan comitatus {{commanders in}} the West: Gaul, Britannia, Illyricum (West), Africa, Tingitania and Hispania. In {{contrast}} to their eastern counterparts, who all held magister militum rank, the commanders of the Western regional comitatus were all of the lower comes rei militaris ("military count") rank, save for the magister equitum per Gallias. This was presumably because all but the Gaul comitatus were smaller than the 20–30,000 typically commanded by a magister militum.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> inmates.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter {{failed to live up}} to the promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt the ball away with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas had no more success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt the ball away as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much beyond the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play after the interception, Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} oldest starter and the veteran {{presence}} in the Giants' starting rotation. In April, Zito went 0–6 with a 7.53 ERA and 11 strikeouts. He was the third pitcher in the last 52 years to go 0–6 before May 1. On April 28, the Giants moved him to the bullpen. Zito did not make an appearance out of the bullpen {{and returned to the}} rotation on May 7 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game, Zito allowed five hits and two earned runs over five innings and took the loss, his seventh of the season. On May 23, Zito collected his first win of the 2008 season against the Florida Marlins. On June 13, Zito became the first pitcher to record 10 losses in the Major Leagues following a 5–1 loss to Oakland. His 5.1 walks per nine innings pitched for the season, 51.5% first-pitch-strike percentage, and 14 sacrifice flies allowed, <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> worst in the majors. Beginning June 25, Zito saw some improvement, as he posted an 8–6 record {{for the rest of the}} season to go along with a 4.33 ERA. He finished the year 10–17 with a career-high 5.15 ERA and 120 strikeouts. His 17 losses led the National League and were the second-worst total in San Francisco history (Ray Sadecki lost 18 games in 1968).|$|E

25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} galactic centre. The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> matter, {{then we can}} model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, we expect that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed. Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distant from the centre as the data is available.|$|E
