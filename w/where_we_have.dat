25|$|A celebration to God’s {{glory and}} to the dignity of man. All that’s left most artists seem to feel these days, is man. Naked, poor, forked radish. There aren’t any celebrations. Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} barbarian peoples, {{such as the}} Vandals, Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Huns, which played an {{important}} part in Rome's loss of the western provinces, the Sueves—establishing themselves in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania, which were remote and extra-Mediterranean areas—seldom posed a threat to Rome and to Rome's interests; in fact, at times <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more detailed knowledge of their history through a diversity of sources, that is precisely when they became a challenge, as it was under the reign of Rechila. Anyhow, all along their history as an independent nation, they maintained an important diplomatic activity, most notably with Rome, the Vandals, the Visigoths, and, later, with the Franks. Again, they become an important player during the reign of Miro, in the last third of the 6th century, when they were in coalition with other Catholic powers—the Franks and the Eastern Romans—in support of Hermenegild, and against the Visigothic king Leovigild. Anyhow, because of their relative isolation and remoteness, sources about the Suevi people are limited, with the number translated into English even fewer.|$|E
25|$|Portrait {{sculpture}} {{began in}} Egypt, where the Narmer Palette shows a {{ruler of the}} 32nd century BCE, and Mesopotamia, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 27 surviving statues of Gudea, who ruled Lagash c. 2144 – 2124 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue {{in a public place}} was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin. In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs. Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the Olmec colossal heads of about 3,000 years ago. East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors. The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait medal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

[...] "The words seemed to flow naturally from the music, and came out with total honesty. They were an expression of my feelings of pride.

The governor, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt [...] "personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, {{in a way that}} respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. He said that current US policy [...] "supports this objective, and I have been encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions."

Upon arrival to Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute {{reserved}} only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops. She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia's highest honor. In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation's Parliament. In the Ivory Coast, she was met by {{a quarter of a}} million people shouting [...] "Vive Madame Nixon!" [...] She conferred with leaders of all three African nations. Upon her return home, White House staffer Charles Colson sent a memo to the President reading in part, [...] "Mrs. Nixon has now broken through <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> failed...
