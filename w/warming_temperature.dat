40|$|We {{report the}} {{successful}} piglet production from cryopreserved oocytes {{for the first}} time by using a simple, high capacity vitrification protocol for preservation and a defined system for in vitro embryo production. Immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from prepubertal gilts were vitrified in microdrops and stored in liquid nitrogen. After warming, COCs were subjected to in vitro maturation (IVM), fertilization (IVF), and subsequent culture (IVC). Adjusting warmplate temperature to 42 °C during warming prevented temperature drops in a medium below 34. 0 °C and significantly increased the percentage of oocyte survival and thus blastocyst yields obtained from total vitrified oocytes compared with that of warming at 38 °C (87. 1 % vs 66. 9 % and 4. 4 % vs 2. 7 %, respectively). Nuclear maturation and fertilization of oocytes were not affected by vitrification and <b>warming</b> <b>temperature.</b> Blastocyst development on day 7 (day 0 = IVF) of the surviving oocytes after warming at 38 °C and 42 °C was not different but lower (P< 0. 05) than those of non-vitrified control oocytes (4. 6 %, 5. 2 % and 17. 9 %, respectively). However, blastocyst cell numbers in the control and vitrified groups were similar irrespective of <b>warming</b> <b>temperature.</b> Omitting porcine follicular fluid (pFF) from IVM medium (POM) did not affect maturation, fertilization and embryo development of vitrified-warmed oocytes. Transfer of blastocysts obtained on day 5 from vitrified oocytes matured either with or without pFF into 4 recipients (2 for each group) resulted in 4 pregnancies and the delivery of a total of 18 piglets. In conclusion, optimization of <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> was a key factor for achieving high survival rates, and surviving oocytes could be utilized in vitro using defined media. Using these modifications, live piglets could be obtained from cryopreserved oocytes {{for the first time}}...|$|E

40|$|The outputs {{from general}} {{circulation}} models (GCMs) provide useful {{information about the}} rate and magnitude of future climate change. The temperature variable is more reliable than other variables in GCM outputs. However, hydrological variables (e. g., precipitation) from GCM outputs for future climate change possess an uncertainty that is too high for practical use. Therefore, a method called intentionally biased bootstrapping (IBB), which simulates the increase of the temperature variable by a certain level as ascertained from observed global warming data, is proposed. In addition, precipitation data were resampled by employing a block-wise sampling technique associated with the temperature simulation. In summary, a <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> scenario is simulated, along with the corresponding precipitation values whose time indices {{are the same as}} those of the simulated <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> scenario. The proposed method was validated with annual precipitation data by truncating the recent years of the record. The proposed model was also employed to assess the future changes in seasonal precipitation in South Korea within a global warming scenario as well as in weekly timescales. The results illustrate that the proposed method is a good alternative for assessing the variation of hydrological variables such as precipitation under the warming condition...|$|E

Recently, rising awareness of climate change has spurred many analyses {{on the cost of}} such change from various channels. Using a disaggregated approach, this paper examines the nonlinear impact of <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> on twenty economic sectors, meanwhile accounting for heterogeneity in the responses.

40|$|Human impact {{plays an}} {{increasing}} role on vegetation change {{even on the}} Tibetan Plateau, {{an area that is}} commonly regarded as an ideal place to study climate change. We evaluate {{the nature and extent of}} human impact on vegetation dynamics by the comparison of two areas: the relative highly populated Lhasa area and a nearby less populated Lhari County. Our results indicate that human impact has mainly decreased vegetation greenness within 20 km of the urban area and major constructions during 1999 – 2013. However, the impact of human activities in a relatively large area is still minor and does not reverse the major trends of vegetation dynamics caused by the <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> in recent decades. It seems that the impact of anthropogenic factors on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trend is more apparent in the Lhasa area than in Lhari County. The major anthropogenic driving factor for vegetation browning in the Lhasa area is livestock number, while the factors, including the number of rural laborers and artificial forest areas, are positively correlated with the annual NDVI increase. The similar relationship between the annual NDVI and driving factors appeared in Lhari County, except for artificial forest areas. The <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> and the change in precipitation played dominant roles on vegetation greening in Lhari County than that in the Lhasa area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) are an alpine obligate species {{under threat}} from climate change because their {{habitats}} are highly influenced by weather conditions and seasonal variability. This research employed metrics {{of climate change}} exposure that measure the spatially explicit nature and magnitude of climate change relative to natural variability across the mountain goat range. Analysis of a multivariate climate change exposure index suggests that goat populations, particularly in the introduced southeastern areas of their range, will be more exposed {{to the effects of}} climate change than those in northern regions. Analysis of the magnitude and direction of change in specific climate variables implies that southeastern region goats will experience less severe winters, but <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> trends and decreases in precipitation may negatively affect forage availability throughout the growing season. These results illuminate the need for more ecologically specific metrics of climate exposure when estimating species potential vulnerability to climate change...|$|E
40|$|The rise {{in global}} mean {{temperature}} is an incomplete description of warming. For many purposes, including agriculture and human life, temperature extremes {{may be more important}} than temperature means and changes in local extremes may be more important than mean global changes. We define a nonparametric statistic to describe extreme temperature behavior by quantifying the frequency of local daily all-time highs and lows, normalized by their frequency in the null hypothesis of no climate change. We average this metric over 1218 weather stations in the 48 contiguous United States, and find significantly fewer all-time lows than for the null hypothesis of unchanging climate. Record highs, by contrast, exhibit no significant trend. The metric is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation for stationary and <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> distributions, permitting comparison of the statistics of historic temperature records with those of modeled behavior.

Loggers were substrate mounted, in two transects of 5, 15 and 25 m depth on a seaward reef and in a lagoonal pass. During the season of mixed but predominantly northwest winds, regular plunges of temperature of 5 - 7 A degrees C occurred with a periodicity of 1 - 4 days.

Temperature traces are compared with HadISST 1 and AVHRR satellite-derived temperature data which do not capture the deeper water temperature plunges.

40|$|Abstract—Climate warming would {{increase}} rainfall by shifting precipitation falling form from snow to rain, and would accelerate snow cover disappearing by increasing snowpack. Using temperature and precipitation {{data in the}} temperature-index snowmelt model, we evaluated variability of snowfall and continuous snow cover duration (CSCD) during 1944 - 2010 over Pelso, central Finland. Mann-Kendall non-parametric test determined that annual precipitation increased by 2. 69 (mm/year, p< 0. 05) during the study period, but no clear trend in annual temperature. Both annual rainfall and snowfall increased by 1. 67 and 0. 78 (mm/year, p< 0. 05), respectively. CSCD was generally about 205 days from 14 October to 6 May. No clear trend was found in CSCD over Pelso. Spearman’s rank correlation showed most significant relationships of annual snowfall with the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, and CSCD with the East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) pattern. Increased precipitation with no <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> caused the rainfall and snowfall to increase, while no effects on CSCD.

40|$|The {{amount of}} leaves in a plant canopy (measured as leaf area index, LAI) modulates key land–atmosphere interactions, {{including}} {{the exchange of}} energy, moisture, carbon dioxide (CO 2), and other trace gases, and is therefore an essential variable in predicting terrestrial carbon, water, and energy fluxes. The latest generation of Earth system models (ESMs) simulate LAI, {{as well as provide}} projections of LAI in the future to improve simulations of biophysical and biogeochemical processes, and for use in climate impact studies. Here we use satellite measurements of LAI to answer the following questions: (1) are the models accurately simulating the mean LAI spatial distribution? (2) Are the models accurately simulating the seasonal cycle in LAI? (3) Are the models correctly simulating the processes driving interannual variability in the current climate? And finally based on this analysis, (4) can we reduce the uncertainty in future projections of LAI by using each model's skill in the current climate? Overall, models are able to capture some of the main characteristics of the LAI mean and seasonal cycle, but all of the models can be improved in one or more regions. Comparison of the modeled and observed interannual variability in the current climate suggested that in high latitudes the models may overpredict increases in LAI based on <b>warming</b> <b>temperature,</b> while in the tropics the models may overpredict the negative impacts of <b>warming</b> <b>temperature</b> on LAI. We expect, however, larger uncertainties in observational estimates of interannual LAI compared to estimates of seasonal or mean LAI. Future projections of LAI by the ESMs are largely optimistic, with only limited regions seeing reductions in LAI. Future projections of LAI in the models are quite different, and are sensitive to climate model projections of precipitation. They also strongly depend on the amount of carbon dioxide fertilization in high latitudes. Based on comparisons between model simulated LAI and observed LAI in the current climate, we can reduce the spread in model future projections, especially in the tropics, by taking into account model skill. In the tropics the models which perform the best in the current climate tend to project a more modest increase in LAI in the future compared to the average of all models. These top performing models also project an increase in the frequency of drought in some regions of the tropics, with droughts being defined as minus one standardized deviation events...|$|E

All RCMs with 50 -km horizontal resolution are integrated for continuous 71 years (1979 - 2049). In the evaluation of historical runs, all models tend to overestimate precipitation over the subtropical western North Pacific. For the surface air temperature, all models have cold biases over the East Asian continent compared to the observation. In the future projections, all models show similar changes in precipitation such as increasing precipitation over the tropical oceans and slightly decreasing precipitation over the East China Sea. In the mid-latitudes, convective precipitation tends to increase due to the enhanced convective instability, while non-convective precipitation tends to decrease slightly due to the changes in subtropical high and monsoon circulation.
