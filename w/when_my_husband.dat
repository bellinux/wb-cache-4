Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that if somebody {{was going to try}} to take me out, I was going to take them with me.|$|E

60|$|It {{will be more}} to {{the purpose}} {{to tell you how}} he worked himself into my good graces. I was born with the tastes of a lady, and he gratified them--in other words, he admired me, and he made me presents. No woman can resist admiration and presents--especially presents, {{provided}} they happen to be just the thing she wants. He was sharp enough to know that--most men are. Naturally he wanted something in return--all men do. And what do you think was the something? The merest trifle. Nothing but the key of the vestry, and the key of the press inside it, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> back was turned. Of course he lied when I asked him why he wished me to get him the keys in that private way. He might have saved himself the trouble--I didn't believe him. But I liked my presents, and I wanted more. So I got him the keys, without <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> knowledge, and I watched him, without his own knowledge. Once, twice, four times I watched him, and the fourth time I found him out.|$|R
5000|$|Founder member Pauline Hoare recalls: [...] "My {{incentive}} was to {{give something}} back.

There was nothing around for prisoners’ families and I {{knew that there were}} women out there who didn’t have a supportive family.

They blew up power stations and put a bomb at my home <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> was dying of cancer. And the bomb was set to detonate at two o'clock in the morning, but it was a construction explosive that doesn't detonate when it drops below freezing. [...] It doesn't usually freeze in San Francisco, but on this night, it dropped below freezing, and the bomb didn't detonate. I was very lucky. But, I thought of what might have happened. Later the same group shot out all the windows of my home.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew my identity and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E

60|$|In truth, I had outgrown the ungainliness of my girlhood, and, {{now that}} it did not matter to any one, had become rather a {{handsome}} woman, and it was of no use to tell her that I had been worse than she, because there was so much more of me, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> dear young <b>husband</b> gave me the whole of his honest heart.|$|R

60|$|One winter--it {{was when}} Suzanne {{was seven years}} old--such a {{south-east}} gale as this blew for four days, and on a certain evening after the wind had fallen, having finished my household work, I went {{to the top of}} the kopje to rest and look at the sea, which was still raging terrible, taking with me Suzanne. I had been sitting there ten minutes or more <b>when</b> Jan, <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> joined me, and I wondered why he had come, for he, as brave a man as ever lived in all other things, was greatly afraid of the sea, and, indeed, of any water. So afraid was he that he did not like the sight of it in its anger, and would wake at nights at the sound of a storm--yes, he whom I have seen sleep through the trumpetings of frightened elephants and the shouting of a Zulu impi.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} give her a few lessons in the morning, and to read to her.

60|$|Some {{time after}} this, I let my son know I was married, and invited {{him over to}} see us, and <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> wrote a very obliging letter to him also, {{inviting}} him {{to come and see}} him; and he came accordingly some months after, and happened to be there just <b>when</b> <b>my</b> cargo from England came in, which I let him believe belonged all to <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> estate, not to me.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} I have created many {{different}} images and explored {{a variety of}} media along my artistic journey.

Fifty times a day I feel the longing in me to throw my arms round his neck, and say: 'For God's sake, do anything to me, rather than treat me like this!' and fifty times a day the words are forced back into my heart by the cruel considerateness of his conduct; which gives me no excuse for speaking them.
