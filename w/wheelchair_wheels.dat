The securement systems included a 4 -point tie-down system, a prototype autodocking system, and a prototype rear-facing wheelchair passenger (RF-WP) system. Study participants took a 15 -minute city ride and completed a survey. Participants responded positively to the autodocking and RF-WP systems that were quicker {{and easier to use}} and allowed more independent use than the 4 -point tie-down system (p < 0. 001). There was concern regarding the RF-WP system that rear-facing travel made it more difficult to see upcoming stops and was less comfortable than a forward-facing ride and that the system may damage <b>wheelchair</b> <b>wheels</b> during use. The majority of participants preferred using an autodocking system because it allowed secure {{and independent}} forward-facing travel.

40|$|Abstract: A {{powered wheel}} chair is a mobility-aided device for persons with moderate/severe {{physical}} disabilities or chronic diseases {{as well as the}} elderly. In order to take care for different disabilities, various kinds of interfaces have been developed for powered wheelchair control; such as joystick control, head control and sip-puff control. Many people with disabilities do not have the ability to control {{powered wheel chair}} using the above mentioned interfaces. The proposed model is a possible alternative. In this paper, we use the optical-type eye tracking system to control powered wheel chair. User‘s eye movement are translated to screen position using the optical type eye tracking system. When user looks at appropriate angle, then computer input system will send command to the software based on the angle of rotation of pupil i. e., when user moves his eyes balls up (move forward), left (move left), right (move right) in all other cases wheel chair will stop. Once the image has been processed it moves onto the second part, our microprocessor. The microprocessor will take a USB output from the laptop and convert the signal into signals that will be sent to the <b>wheelchair</b> <b>wheels</b> for movement. Also, the pressure and object detection sensors will be connected to our microprocessor to provide necessary feedback for proper operation of the wheelchair system. The final part of the project is the wheelchair itself. The rear wheels will provide forward. The front two wheels will be used for steering left and right.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to design and build an after-market suspension for the rear wheels of a manual wheelchair. Suspension for wheelchairs is important because it has been reported that the International Organization for Standards 2 ̆ 7 requirements for vibration loads on wheelchair users (ISO 2631 - 1), are not meet by today 2 ̆ 7 s standard wheelchairs. Today 2 ̆ 7 s wheelchairs need to be able to absorb everyday shock loads, thereby minimizing the energy transmitted to the user. The chosen design is based around the concept of adding shock reduction material between the hub of the wheel, and the axel bolt that connects the wheel to the frame of the chair. The approach taken was to design a suspension system that resides between an oversized wheel bearing, and the axle. To do this, ball-race bearings with an inner diameter of 42 ̆ 2 were chosen, and polyurethane rubber was used as the shock absorbing material. Pro-Mechanica, a finite element analysis program, was used to analyze the suspension system. Since the most common camber/tilt for <b>wheelchair</b> <b>wheels</b> is three degrees from the vertical, the anticipated loads were applied to the wheel at this angle. A prototype of the suspension system was constructed to verify that the design would work, but no tests were performed on it. This analysis showed that the suspension system should not fail when subjected to 10 times the static load. This load was considered large enough to encompass the forces that a wheelchair chair wheel is typically subjected to. There is room for further work in the area of weight reduction, and in the use of the suspension system on steeper wheel cambers...|$|E
40|$|Prototype {{of newly}} {{developed}} power-assisted <b>wheelchair</b> <b>wheels</b> were evaluated {{to determine their}} potential alleviating value on shoulder load, daily activities and participation compared to hand-rim wheelchair propulsion. Five research questions were answered: 1. 	What is the current knowledge of power-assisted wheelchair propulsion? Power-assisted propulsion reduces the strain on the upper extremity and cardiovascular system compared to hand-rim propulsion. Precision tasks are easier to perform with hand-rim wheelchairs and tasks which require more torque are easier to perform with power-assisted wheelchairs. 2. 	Who might benefit from power-assist wheels? People having (temporally) difficulty propelling hand-rim wheelchairs because of pain, low cardiopulmonary reserves or insufficient arm strength, or in a challenging environment / on longer distances. 3. 	What are the wheelchair characteristics of the prototype {{and what are the}} differences with a hand-rim wheelchair, specifically rolling resistance, propulsion efficiency and energy expenditure? Significantly higher drag forces (due to mass), increased propulsion efficiency and decreased energy expenditure were found for the prototype power-assisted wheelchair (if well set) compared to the hand-rim wheelchair. 4. 	Is the assumption of the effectiveness of power-assisted propulsion in reducing potential risk factors for shoulder overuse injuries correct? With the prototype wheels partly. •	minimize push frequency: Push frequency did not change significantly in healthy, while in hand-rim wheelchair users the push-frequency, even increased during propulsion. •	minimize the force required: The peak resultant force at the rim reduced during propulsion as well as start-up. The changes in specified directions were ambiguous and varied between both populations (healthy vs. hand-rim wheelchair users) and movements (start-up vs. velocity propulsion). •	minimizing extreme or potentially injurious positions at the shoulder. Internal rotation at the shoulder decreased during the peak force at the rim. At start-up the extension angle increased. 5. 	Are power-assist wheels beneficial in daily situations, and what is the user's opinion about the prototype power-assist wheels? Although increased ease of propulsion was reported, objective ratings showed no significant changes in wheelchair skills and self-efficacy during power-assisted hand-rim wheelchair propulsion. High work-capacity of the arm, use of a hand-bike and independent car transfers, seemed negative influencers for satisfaction with the power-assist-wheels...|$|E
40|$|Just like {{shifting}} gears on a bicycle, multiple gears on {{a manual}} wheelchair {{can make it}} easier to complete many tasks of daily living. We developed an automatic gear-shifting system (AGS) for manually propelled wheelchairs. The AGS has three speeds ??? first gear: for ascending slopes or traversing compliant surfaces, second gear: traditional direct-drive for everyday situations, and third gear: for improved ergonomics during fast propulsion. The AGS is packaged as an add-on set of two <b>wheelchair</b> <b>wheels</b> (each with its own 3 -speed transmission connecting the hand rim and tire) and onboard electronics for gear shifting. A previous gear shifting design for manual wheelchairs (Magic Wheels, Magic Wheels, Inc.; Seattle, Washington), required the user to stop completely and manually shift gears, whereas the AGS can shift on the fly automatically. The Magic Wheels device was shown to significantly reduce the level of shoulder pain when used for long periods of time, so {{it is likely that the}} AGS can provide the same benefit but with increased usability. A prototype of the AGS was constructed and tested over the course of a year. Although many mechanical and electrical components experienced a number of issues, each was analyzed and redesigned. At the very least, clear guidelines were provided for future development. Additionally, a study was done to evaluate the AGS???s usability by assessing user perception of the AGS ability to reduce the effort of propelling a wheelchair. This study also documented changes in wheelchair propulsion metrics including task completion time, number of pushes, and push frequency. Eleven fulltime manual wheelchair users (ages 34 ?? 14 years) were recruited to compare the AGS to a traditional direct-drive configuration and rate their level of perceived exertion while completing 10 tasks of daily living. Nine participants perceived the AGS as easier for at least one task of daily living, and four participants rated the AGS as easier to use for more than half of the tasks. Subjects perceived a significant advantage when traversing up a steep slope and crossing an uneven doorway threshold. Interestingly, subjects with less trunk control (higher spinal cord injuries) consistently rated the AGS configuration more favorable than subjects with more trunk control. Although the low gear increased the time and number of pushes to complete a task, the AGS did not increase the push frequency of wheelchair propulsion which suggests that the design encourages optimal propulsion strategies. Gear-shifting may be an effective option for making wheelchair propulsion easier, especially for individuals with reduced trunk function...|$|E
