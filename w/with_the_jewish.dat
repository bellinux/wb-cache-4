5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people, he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E

5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose to side <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being {{a symbol of the}} recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{begins in}} a chamber {{containing}} the Bequest Globe, a device which the player has recently inherited.

A voice welcomes the player and tells them the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock {{the secret of the}} drowned god.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Artabanus III, two Jewish commoners and brothers, Anilai and Asinai from Nehardea (near modern Fallujah, Iraq), led a revolt against the Parthian {{governor}} of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus III, who feared further rebellion elsewhere. Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of fear he would attack Anilai over his marriage to a gentile. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the local Jewish community, forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35–36AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local Greeks and Aramaeans. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and Nisibis.|$|E

5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, the War Cabinet {{decided to}} form a second AIF division, the 7th Division, and group the 6th and 7th Divisions {{together}} as I Corps, with Blamey as its commander. On Blamey's recommendation, Major General Iven Mackay was appointed to succeed him {{in command of the}} 6th Division, while Lieutenant General John Lavarack, a PMF officer, assumed command of the 7th Division. Blamey took Rowell with him as his corps chief of staff, and picked Major General Henry Wynter as his administrative officer. Blamey flew to Palestine on a Qantas flying boat in June 1940. He refused to allow his troops to perform police duties in Palestine, and established warm relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> community there, becoming a frequent guest in their homes.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{maintained}} tolerant {{policies and}} encouraged {{the involvement of}} religious minorities in the local economy. As part of his larger efforts to enlarge the population of Galilee, Zahir invited Jews to resettle in Tiberias around 1742, along with Muslims. Zahir did not consider Jews {{to be a threat}} to his rule and believed that their connections <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> diaspora would encourage economic development in Tiberias, which the Jews considered particularly holy. His tolerance towards the Jews, the cuts in taxes levied on them, and assistance in the construction of Jewish homes, schools and synagogues, helped foster the growth of the Jewish community in the area. The initial Jewish immigrants came from Damascus and were later followed by Jews from Aleppo, Cyprus and Smyrna. Many Jews in Safad, which was governed by Zahir's son Ali, moved to Tiberias in the 1740s to take advantage of better opportunities in that city, which at the time was under Zahir's direct rule. The villages of Kafr Yasif and Shefa-'Amr also saw new Jewish communities spring up under Zahir's rule.|$|E
