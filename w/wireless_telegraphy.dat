5|$|The <b>Wireless</b> <b>Telegraphy</b> Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy</b> apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy,</b> including the establishment or use of a <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy</b> station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The <b>Wireless</b> <b>Telegraphy</b> Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

5000|$|WKDN began {{broadcasting}} as WPEN on April 19, 1929, originally as a 250-watt {{station on}} 1500 kHz. The frequency was previously {{shared by the}} Pennsylvania School of <b>Wireless</b> <b>Telegraphy's</b> WPSW, which {{went on the air}} in 1926, and Bethayres-based WALK, which launched in 1927; both stations were acquired by William Penn Broadcasting and merged to create WPEN. In its early years, it was known for Italian-language programming, and was co-owned with another major Italian-oriented station, WOV in New York City. Beginning in November 1929, Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission broadcast their Sunday morning services from their 800-person homeless shelter and soup kitchen. The most notable speaker was Percy Crawford who spoke consistently to the crowd of homeless men. [...] In the 1930s, WPEN moved to 920 kHz, sharing time with WRAX until the two stations merged in 1938. WPEN then went to 950 kHz in the NARBA frequency shifts of 1941. During the mid-1940s, the station was owned by the Philadelphia Bulletin newspaper; in 1948, the newspaper bought the more powerful WCAU and sold WPEN to the local Sun Ray Drug Store chain. As entertainment programming moved from radio to television, WPEN evolved into a popular music format in the early 1950s. The music at that time consisted of artists such Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Mills Brothers, Tommy Dorsey, Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole, Pat Boone, Tony Bennett, and many others. At this time, a show called the [...] "950 Club" [...] began as well.|$|R

5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy.</b> After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet.

That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight. During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of Heligoland.|$|E

She cost £294,000 to build, including a payment of £35,000 to her builders who had underestimated their costs. She {{served with the}} Channel Fleet until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886; during this time her only military activity occurred when she was detailed to service in the Particular Service Squadron {{under the command of}} Admiral Hornsby during the Russian war scare of June to August, 1878. Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen, and her family, were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy</b> interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{reassembled}} on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, {{where it}} conducted a mock {{attack on the}} harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy</b> {{on a large scale}} and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major landing operation, after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} wave of {{economic}} globalization began {{during the period}} of 1870–1914, marked by transportation expansion, record levels of migration, enhanced communications, trade expansion, and growth in capital transfers. During the mid-nineteenth century, the passport system in Europe dissolved as rail transport expanded rapidly. Most countries issuing passports did not require their carry, thus people could travel freely without them. The standardization of international passports would not arise until 1980 under the guidance of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. From 1870 to 1915, 36 million Europeans migrated away from Europe. Approximately 25 million (or 70%) of these travelers migrated to the United States, while most of the rest reached Canada, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe itself experienced an influx of foreigners from 1860 to 1910, growing from 0.7% of the population to 1.8%. While the absence of meaningful passport requirements allowed for free travel, migration on such an enormous scale would have been prohibitively difficult if not for technological advances in transportation, particularly the expansion of railway travel and the dominance of steam-powered boats over traditional sailing ships. World railway mileage grew from 205,000 kilometers in 1870 to 925,000 kilometers in 1906, while steamboat cargo tonnage surpassed that of sailboats in the 1890s. Advancements such as the telephone and <b>wireless</b> <b>telegraphy</b> (the precursor to radio) revolutionized telecommunication by providing instantaneous communication. In 1866, the first transatlantic cable was laid beneath the ocean to connect London and New York, while Europe and Asia became connected through new landlines.|$|E
