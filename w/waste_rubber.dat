50|$|The {{generation}} of {{vast quantities of}} <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> from car tires has sparked interest in finding uses for this discarded rubber. The rubber {{can be turned into}} a fine powder, which can then be used as a toughening agent for polystyrene. However, poor miscibility between the <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> and polystyrene will weaken the material. This problem requires the use of a compatibilizer (see compatibilization) in order to reduce interfacial tension and ultimately make rubber toughening of polystyrene effective. A polystyrene/styrene-butadiene copolymer acts to increase the adhesion between the dispersed and continuous phases.|$|E

In the case of larger <b>rubber</b> products, the <b>waste</b> <b>rubbers</b> and the used products have been recycled. However the <b>waste</b> <b>rubbers</b> of smaller rubber products and the used products are not recycled and are incinerated. An aseismatic mat is one of the smaller products and it is made of polyurethane rubber. The mats are manufactured a lot in Japan, so a lot of <b>waste</b> <b>rubbers</b> occur and are incinerated. In order to recycle the <b>waste</b> polyurethane <b>rubbers,</b> we created a composite cube as a structural material by using the <b>waste</b> <b>rubbers.</b> The composite cube had 15 mm on a side. Unsaturated polyester was used as a matrix, and then the <b>waste</b> polyurethane <b>rubbers</b> were put in the unsaturated polyester. The <b>waste</b> polyurethane <b>rubbers</b> were minced and the minced rubbers were made into a ball. Some composite cubes on different quantities of the rubbers were prepared. Static compression tests were carried out with the composite cubes and with a cube made of only unsaturated polyester. Comparing with the load-displacement curves, {{it has been shown that}} a maximum load of the 0. 1 g-rubber-containing composite cube is larger than that of the rubber-free cube. However it has been shown that a maximum load of the 0. 5 g-rubber-containing composite cube is not larger than that of the rubber-free cube. So it is possible that polyurethane rubber reinforce unsaturated polyester, if the rubber is minced and is made into a ball and is used in the appropriate contained amount...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading on mechanical and thermal conductivity properties were investigated for NR composite. An experimental investigation {{was carried out}} to obtain low cost construction material with desirable mechanical and thermal insulation properties. Natural rubber was loaded with different concentrations of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000) phr. The addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to {{a slight increase in}} thermal conductivity values of composites but it still lies around range of thermal insulating materials. Also addition of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> leads to improvement of mechanical properties of composites. The crosslink density of NR composite increases with the increase of <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading until 600 phr and after that it decreases due to the stronger the rubber–filler interaction. This leads to the decrease of the swelling index that has the opposite trend of crosslink density. So, the sample with 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> is considered the optimum concentration from the swelling measurement. Filler loading results in pronounced increase in the tensile modulus and decease in the elongation at fracture which reflects the reinforcement effect of the filler. The yield stress increases with <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading increment. This delays the permanent disruption of matrix morphology. So, the optimum concentration which is 600 phr <b>waste</b> <b>rubber</b> loading agrees with the swelling and mechanical measurements which has desirable thermal insulation and high mechanical properties and decreases the cost of materials to 82 % of the NR cost...|$|E
