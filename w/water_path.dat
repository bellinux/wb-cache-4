25|$|Bonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a {{time during}} her {{childhood}} in 1944 {{when she was}} exploring the cave. She left English class, playing 'hooky,' and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and it blew out again. Terrified, she crawled along the <b>water</b> <b>path</b> of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives {{in the back of}} the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.|$|E
60|$|When November came, and fur was prime, I carried down a half-bushel {{basket of}} heads and {{stuff from the}} fish market, and piled them up temptingly on the bank, above a little <b>water</b> <b>path,</b> in a lonely spot by the river. At {{the lower end of}} the path, where it came out of the water, I set a trap, my biggest one, with a famous grip for skunks and woodchucks. But the fish rotted away, as did also another basketful in another place. Whatever was eaten went to the crows and mink. Keeonekh disdained it.|$|E
5000|$|The liquid <b>water</b> <b>path</b> also {{contributes}} to important cloud properties. As {{the value of the}} liquid <b>water</b> <b>path</b> increases, so does the albedo of the cloud. This increase in albedo is seen most quickly {{at the lower end of}} the liquid <b>water</b> <b>path</b> spectrum, that is, the smaller the amount of total water, the quicker the albedo increases. The radiative absorption of clouds is also dependent on the liquid <b>water</b> <b>path.</b> An increase of liquid <b>water</b> <b>path</b> leads to an increase in absorption. Again, the largest increase is seen with lower levels of liquid <b>water</b> <b>path.</b> [...] These connections are due to the proportionality between the liquid <b>water</b> <b>path</b> and the optical depth of the cloud.|$|E
40|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, central governments managed water supply through largescale infrastructure, {{known as the}} <b>water</b> hard <b>path.</b> <b>Water</b> experts {{advocate}} for an alternative paradigm for the twenty-first century, or the <b>water</b> soft <b>path,</b> to encourage demand management through conservation technologies. Geographers and other social scientists have examined the <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> as a policy prescription by evaluating its water conservation effectiveness. Yet, only a few scholars address how the <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> intersects with existing socio-economic or political processes, and how these interactions alter social relations for those enrolled in the water regime. These studies {{tend to focus on}} the integration of <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> technologies in urban and peri-urban areas for social reproduction. The major research question therefore becomes: How does the <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> create new pathways of accessing and using water resources that contribute to larger processes of social and political change in the countryside? This project uses a mixed methods case study approach to examine the implementation of the WSP for groundwater irrigation in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. Research involved long-term fieldwork, including interviews and surveys with farmers, as well as participation observation. Results show that the <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> emerged in response to water scarcity, but also {{as part of a broader}} package of political economic reform that entailed the rescripting of state-led environmental governance. The emergence of the <b>water</b> soft <b>path,</b> however, did not signify a complete displacement of the <b>water</b> hard <b>path,</b> rather a coexistence of the two. This coexistence enabled state power to work through the instruments of the <b>water</b> soft <b>path</b> to enforce principles of demand management without devolving control over natural resources to water users. The contradictions produced by this coexistence exacerbated biophysical, economic, and political uncertainties of groundwater irrigators. The ability to mitigate these uncertainties is tied to access to irrigation efficiency devices of the <b>water</b> soft <b>path.</b> Accessing these devices, however, is not equally available to all irrigators. Thus the <b>water</b> soft <b>path,</b> through its coexistence with the <b>water</b> hard <b>path,</b> reproduces patterns and processes of power asymmetries and uneven development...|$|R

40|$|A soft <b>paths</b> {{strategy}} for <b>water</b> involves shifting from managing {{the supply of}} water, to reducing existing water demand while increasing efficiency. <b>Water</b> soft <b>paths</b> study involves defining a state of future water sustainability and a charting path to achieve it. In order to apply the concept of <b>water</b> soft <b>paths</b> to a region such as the Canadian Prairie Province of Manitoba, which has a low population density, intensive agricultural production, and a highly variable and seasonal wa-ter regime; {{it is necessary to}} determine the present state of Manitoba’s watersheds. The Interna-tional Institute for Sustainable Development has been studying the potential of a <b>water</b> soft <b>paths</b> {{strategy for}} southern Manitoba. This study has involved constructing a watershed model to de-termine the present water budget. By entering climate change scenario predictions into the model, it has been possible to predict the response of Manitoba watersheds to climate change. This paper outlines the concept of <b>water</b> soft <b>paths</b> and how it applies in Manitoba’s agro-ecosystem, and describes the modelling work done to determine baseline and future conditions.

30|$|Second, CH 14 {{evaluated}} droplet effective radii near cloud tops, liquid <b>water</b> <b>paths,</b> and cloud optical thicknesses calculated {{in their}} simulations {{in comparison with}} those obtained from the Terra/MODIS satellite measurements through retrieval (see Table 2 in CH 14); details of the retrieval algorithm are described by Nakajima et al. (2005). Simulations using the updated and outdated aerosol loading modules led to different values of the variables, although the cloud distribution patterns were similar. The droplet effective radii were smaller, and the liquid <b>water</b> <b>paths</b> and cloud optical thicknesses were larger in the updated simulation compared with the outdated simulation. These differences resulted from larger CDNC attributed to the larger CN and CCN number concentrations. Overall, the values in the updated simulation were in better agreement with those estimated from the satellite measurements, reflecting the better reproduction of the CN and CCN concentrations in the updated version.|$|R
