25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the <b>words</b> <b>come</b> out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
25|$|As the Dravanians {{prepare to}} resume their siege of Ishgard, Alphinaud {{suggests}} that they use Lady Iceheart to broker peace with Nidhogg through negotiation. Estinien offers his lance to aid this endeavor, promising to slay the great wyrm if <b>words</b> <b>come</b> to blows. Iceheart reveals that she too possesses the Echo {{and used it to}} glimpse at the truth behind the war. Born Ysayle, she took the name Iceheart after communing with the soul of Shiva, the mortal woman whose love for the great wyrm Hraesvelgr allowed man and dragon to coexist peacefully for two hundred years. Yet the Elezen grew envious of the dragons' power and conspired to steal Nidhogg's eye, the source of his strength. This, she claims, is the origin of the Dragonsong War. Aiming to avoid further bloodshed, Ysayle agrees to take the party to parley with Hraesvelgr for his aid in ending the war.|$|E

25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect <b>words</b> <b>come</b> to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E

It has been hypothesised that a Proto-Indo-European word *morwi- was used, cf.

It {{refers to the}} mythical tragelaph which was imagined to be half-goat, half-stag.

2500|$|The name Deutschland and {{the other}} similar-sounding names above are derived from the Old High German diutisc, or similar {{variants}} from Proto-Germanic *Þeudiskaz, which originally meant [...] "of the people". This in turn comes from a Germanic word meaning [...] "folk" [...] (leading to Old High German diot, Middle High German diet), and was used to differentiate between the speakers of Germanic languages and those who spoke Celtic or Romance languages. These <b>words</b> <b>come</b> from *teuta, the Proto-Indo-European word for [...] "people" [...] (Lithuanian tauta, Old Irish tuath, Old English þeod).|$|E
2500|$|In Protestant commentaries it {{is often}} stated that [...] "whenever John reports Jesus as saying ego eimi, a claim to deity is implicit." [...] In commentaries the English [...] "I am" [...] is {{sometimes}} capitalised [...] "I AM" [...] to demonstrate a connection with how the English Bibles often capitalize words where the Hebrew text has the Tetragrammaton (YHWH), e.g. {{as the use of}} [...] "LORD" [...] in the King James Version. For example; [...] "These mighty <b>words</b> <b>come</b> from the Greek words ego eimi, which is more accurately translated, [...] "I AM!". This is also found in some Catholic commentaries.
