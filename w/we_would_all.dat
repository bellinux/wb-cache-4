The episode introduces a romantic relationship between Veronica and Logan through their first kiss. Originally, Veronica and Logan were {{not intended to be}} a couple. At PaleyFest 2014, series creator Rob Thomas stated that [...] "The truth is, we never had any intention at all for Logan to end up with Veronica.

500|$|In December 2015, astronomers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) {{detected}} a brief series of 350GHz pulses that they concluded must either be {{a series of}} independent sources, or a single, fast moving source. Deciding that the latter was the most likely, they calculated based on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the object, which they named [...] "Gna" [...] after a fast-moving messenger goddess in Norse mythology, would be about 12–25 AU distant and have a dwarf planet-sized diameter of 220 to 880km. However, {{if it were a}} rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be much larger. The paper was never formally accepted, and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed. Scientists' reactions to the notice were largely sceptical; Mike Brown commented that, [...] "If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny, tiny, tiny, field of view, that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the outer solar system ... Even better, I just realized that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire solar system and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> die." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 December 2005 it was {{announced}} that Buena had left the Sugababes. Amelle Berrabah was revealed as her replacement one day later. As a result of the line-up change, Taller in More Ways was re-released to feature Berrabah's vocals on three tracks, which included [...] "Red Dress", [...] "Gotta Be You" [...] and [...] "Follow Me Home". [...] "Red Dress" [...] was subsequently chosen as the third single from the album. Buena later revealed that she had been uncomfortable with the original version of the song after recording it, clarifying that she [...] "absolutely hated" [...] it. Upon hearing the new version with Berrabah, she became [...] "quite happy they did it." [...] The song was released as a CD single and digital download on 6 March 2006 by Island Records. It is featured on the Sugababes' greatest hits album, [...] (2006), and the soundtrack for the 2006 film It's a Boy Girl Thing. The Sugababes confirmed in January 2006 that the B-side to [...] "Red Dress" [...] would be a cover version of Arctic Monkeys' debut single [...] "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor", which replaced the group's 2005 single [...] "Push the Button" [...] at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Upon the recording of the B-side, the Sugababes said: [...] "When our bosses asked us to think of covers for the B-side, we knew which song <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> love to do." [...] Ben Thompson of The Observer praised Berrabah's [...] "bluesy rasp" [...] as a novelty, while Jimmy Draper of Time Out wrote: [...] "It transforms the punky rave-up into a disco stomper that could make even the staunchiest pop-hater get up and dance".|$|E

Short also introduced the subject of Transition Towns, speaking about the first of such towns in Totnes, Devon, UK.

2500|$|Late {{in the day}} on 30 March, {{an obscure}} group calling itself Harakat al Nahda wal-Islah (The Movement for Renewal and Reform), led by Wael Abbas, claimed {{responsibility}} for the kidnapping. The group attached copies of three of the Estonian cyclists' ID cards to an email sent to lebanonfiles.com, adding that the Estonians were in good condition and that it would state its demands at a later time. Overnight between 30 and 31 March, Lebanese security forces estimated they were but hours away from resolving the crisis and were optimistic its ending would be a happy one. A source was quoted as saying the kidnappers had been hired by foreign parties. On 6 April lebanonfiles.com indicated that it had received a follow-up email from Harakat al-Nahda overnight demanding a ransom of an unspecified sum. Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip unequivocally rejected the ransom demand. [...] "States do not negotiate with terrorists," [...] he said.

2500|$|The {{use of the}} ADE 651 has {{prompted}} strong criticism and eventually led to {{a ban on the}} device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. U.S. Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that [...] "there's [...] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be using it. I have no confidence that these work." [...] Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that [...] "none have ever performed better than random chance."

2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{academic}} {{criticism of}} the book has sought to appropriate it {{one way or the}} other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O'Brien's embrace of myth and refusal of realism [...] "ensnare him with the second rank", have been in the minority. Vivian Mercier described it in The Irish Comic Tradition as [...] "the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century– with the doubtful exception of Finnegans Wake." [...] Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B.S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to At Swim-Two-Birds. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O'Brien in At Swim-Two-Birds.... <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> be very much poorer without Mad O'Brien's narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour At Swim-Two-Birds as [...] "the primary defining text of the O'Brien oeuvre", the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O'Brien's second novel, the posthumously published The Third Policeman:At Swim-Two-Birds is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I will argue that the metafictional techniques developed publicly in ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of The Third Policeman.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
