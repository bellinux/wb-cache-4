Many semiconductors of interest have been synthesized in one-dimensional forms such as <b>wires,</b> <b>belts</b> and tubes by various methods [1].

Hitler repeatedly stressed the crucial importance of this area, telling his commanders that the [...] "Loss of Nikopol would mean the end of war." [...] The Nikopol bridgehead also held operational significance because it could serve as a springboard for an assault to relieve German troops trapped in Crimea, and Hitler refused demands by Army Group South commander Erich von Manstein for its evacuation. As a result, the bridgehead was heavily fortified, with three lines of trenches in its first defensive line, strengthened by barbed <b>wire</b> <b>belts</b> and minefields. All heights and settlements immediately behind the front were turned into fortified strongpoints. Despite Hitler's obsession with the bridgehead, the mining of manganese ore ceased during the winter of 1943 and 1944 and the previously mined stocks [...] "could not be moved" [...] {{due to a lack of}} transport, according to 6th Army chief of staff Lieutenant General Max Bork. On 4 January 1944, Manstein flew to Führer Headquarters expressly to persuade Hitler to allow a withdrawal from Nikopol and Crimea in order to shorten the front, but his request was denied. On 1 January, 6th Army was transferred from Army Group A to Army Group South. Around this time, Manstein transferred the 1st Panzer Army to the northern sector, leaving a few of its infantry divisions behind in the Nikopol bridgehead; these joined the 6th Army.|$|R

40|$|Abstract As a {{self-organizing}} entity, an ant colony must divide {{a limited}} number of workers among numerous com-peting functions. Adaptive patterns of labor allocation should vary with colony need across each annual cycle, but remain almost entirely undescribed in ants. Allocation to foraging in 55 field colonies of the Florida harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex badius) followed a consistent annual pattern over 4 years. Foragers preceded larvae in spring and peaked during maxi-mal larval production in summer (0. 37). In spring, proportion foraging increased due to an increase in forager number and reduction in colony size, and in late summer, it decreased as colony size increased through new worker birth and a loss of ∼ 3 % of foragers per day. The removal of 50 % of the forager population revealed that, at the expense of larval survival, colonies did not draw workers from other castes to fill labor gaps. To determine if labor allocation was age specific, whole colonies were marked with cuticle color-specific <b>wire</b> <b>belts</b> and released, and each cohort's time to first foraging was noted. Workers that eclosed in summer alongside sexual alates darkened quickly and became foragers at ∼ 43 days of age, whereas autumn-born workers required 200 or more days to do so. Following colony reproduction, these long-lived indi-viduals foraged alongside short-lived, summer-born sisters during the next calendar year. Therefore, the large-scale, pre-dictable patterns of labor allocation in P. badius appear to be driven by bimodal worker development rate and age structure, rather than worker responsiveness to changes in colony demand...|$|R
