30|$|The <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between the <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when the <b>wind</b> speed {{is less than the}} cut-in <b>wind,</b> the <b>wind</b> power is 0; when the <b>wind</b> speed is between the cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and the rated <b>wind</b> speed, the <b>wind</b> power will be the smooth output; when the <b>wind</b> speed is between the rated <b>wind</b> speed and the cut-out <b>wind,</b> the <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when the <b>wind</b> speed is greater than the cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, the <b>wind</b> power will be 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power, the prediction distribution of <b>wind</b> power is complex.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{the massive}} {{development}} {{and application of}} <b>wind</b> energy, <b>wind</b> power is having an increasing proportion in power grid. The changes of the <b>wind</b> speed in a <b>wind</b> farm will lead to fluctuations in the power output which would affect the stable operation of the power grid. Therefore the research {{of the characteristics of}} <b>wind</b> speed has become a hot topic in the field of <b>wind</b> energy. In the paper, the <b>wind</b> speed at the <b>wind</b> farm was simulated in a combination of <b>wind</b> speeds by which <b>wind</b> speed was decomposed of four components including basic <b>wind,</b> gust <b>wind,</b> stochastic <b>wind</b> and gradient <b>wind</b> which denote the regularity, the mutability, the gradual change and the randomness of a natural <b>wind</b> respectively. The model is able to reflect the characteristics of a real <b>wind,</b> easy for engineering simulation and can also estimate the <b>wind</b> energy of a <b>wind</b> farm through the <b>wind</b> speed and wake effect model. This paper has directive significance in the estimation of <b>wind</b> resource and the layout of <b>wind</b> turbines in <b>wind</b> farms...|$|R

30|$|Big <b>wind</b> farms must be {{integrated}} to power system. <b>Wind</b> power from big <b>wind</b> farms, with randomness, volatility and intermittent, will bring adverse {{impacts on the}} connected power system. High precision <b>wind</b> power forecasting is helpful to reduce above adverse impacts. There {{are two kinds of}} <b>wind</b> power forecasting. One is to forecast <b>wind</b> power only based on its time series data. The other is to forecast <b>wind</b> power based on <b>wind</b> speeds from weather forecast. For a big <b>wind</b> farm, due to its spatial scale and dynamics of <b>wind,</b> <b>wind</b> speeds at different <b>wind</b> turbines are obviously different, that is called <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion. Spatial dispersion of <b>wind</b> speeds and its influence on the <b>wind</b> power forecasting errors have been studied in this paper. An error evaluation framework has been established to account for the errors caused by <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion. A case study of several <b>wind</b> farms has demonstrated that even if the forecasting average <b>wind</b> speed is accurate, the error caused by <b>wind</b> speed spatial dispersion cannot be ignored for the <b>wind</b> power forecasting of a <b>wind</b> farm.|$|R
30|$|<b>Wind</b> speed {{measurement}} is collected from day-ahead <b>wind</b> data [9]. Based on the <b>wind</b> speed, <b>wind</b> power output {{can be calculated}} by (15). Cut in <b>wind</b> speed, rated <b>wind</b> speed and cut off <b>wind</b> speed for Skystream <b>wind</b> turbine respectively are 3.5  m/s, 9  m/s and 25  m/s.|$|R
30|$|The current <b>wind</b> speed {{forecasting}} {{model can}} be classified into physical model and historical <b>wind</b> model. The former is used to forecast <b>wind</b> speed based on numerical weather report while the latter uses historical <b>wind</b> speed to extrapolate. <b>Wind</b> resource has certain regional feature which means different positions has varies values in a <b>wind</b> farm. But at present researches always assume that <b>wind</b> speed of every <b>wind</b> turbines in a <b>wind</b> farm is equal [2, 3, 4] {{at the same time}} when studying <b>wind</b> model we often assume. Apparently, these models cannot accurately reflect the <b>wind</b> speed in reality [5, 6]. Therefore, it will affect <b>wind</b> farm outputs because lack of <b>wind</b> speed correlation and further influence power dispatching and power system operation. In order to improve the capability of energy-saving power generation dispatching and <b>wind</b> power consumption, studying the influence of correlative <b>wind</b> of large <b>wind</b> farm is essential and <b>wind</b> speed polymerized model should be introduced.|$|R

30|$|The most {{commonly}} used equivalent method is to aggregate <b>wind</b> turbines with similar incoming winds; however, two problems arise {{in the implementation of}} the method. First, the criteria to classify incoming <b>winds</b> need to be defined. Second, incoming <b>winds</b> for equivalent <b>wind</b> turbines, need to be calculated. References [4, 5] proposed two methods: the first one is the average <b>wind</b> method, which sets a criterion, differences in <b>wind</b> speeds < 2  m/s, for the classification of incoming <b>winds,</b> and the average <b>winds</b> of the ones incident on aggregated <b>wind</b> turbines (AWTs) are used as equivalent <b>winds.</b> The second one is equivalent <b>wind</b> method (EWM), which aggregates all <b>wind</b> turbines into a single AWT, eliminating the need to classify any incoming <b>winds.</b> With EWM, the equivalent <b>wind</b> is derived from the power curves of AWT [4, 5]. The performance of EWM is better than that of the average <b>wind</b> method since EWM can aggregate <b>wind</b> turbines with different incoming <b>winds.</b>|$|R
40|$|We study {{whether a}} <b>wind</b> {{augmented}} <b>wind</b> turbine is effective {{for improving the}} efficiency of <b>wind</b> turbines or not. An augmentation device creases mass flow rate through a <b>wind</b> turbine, {{and the power of}} a <b>wind</b> augmented <b>wind</b> turbine becomes large. On the other hand, the augmentation device makes the size of a <b>wind</b> turbine increase. So, improving the efficiency depends on the rate of increased power and size. Some conditions on improving the efficiency are given. In order to make an augmentation device short, we propose a two-flow model for a <b>wind</b> augmented <b>wind</b> turbine.
