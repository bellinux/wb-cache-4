60|$|Giving {{the woman}} {{permission}} to withdraw for a <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> with some anxiety {{to hear what}} the Prisoner wanted of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "She gained time, as you see. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> {{for her to}} {{interfere}} you were marching away, and she was really beating the drum." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{crouched}} down, and, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> {{watched the}} puffs of dust {{raised by the}} bullets. We began the return side by side and running.|$|E

6000|$|... "As {{these men}} are evidently coming in quest of me," [...] I remarked, [...] "it may be as well, ladies, for you to {{continue}} your walk toward home, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> for them on this stile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yoong man," [...] {{said the}} miner, [...] "thou's got to mak' t' wife's {{medicine}} here, and now, and quick, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> and watch thee, or else happen thou might need some medicine thysel' before all is over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I might {{spend a year}} or so in {{traveling}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> or Sam and {{you might}} hurry up a little," [...] answered the eldest Rover.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I found. It is {{a quaint}} place, that old chapel of yours, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> I {{went to the}} altar and told my beads there, which I {{had no time to}} do before I left my lodgings." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. I {{told you}} I was reading them <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for you. He {{came in and}} I put them away. I suppose he suspected. It was very {{easy for him to}} get into the room after amah and I went away.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are {{to let me}} come {{sometimes}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait,</b> {{and wear}} this lest you should forget me," [...] he said, pulling a ring {{from his pocket and}} gently drawing a warm, bare hand out of the muff where it lay hidden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you think:" [...] the uncomplaining eyes {{in which}} there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble: [...] "that it will seem long to me, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> for her in the better land where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> I heard, upstairs, that unmistakable sound {{instantly}} {{recognized the}} world over--a bickering woman's voice, rising as her anger and fury grew. I could hear, between the gusts, the temperate rumble of Bell's tones, striving to oil the troubled waters.|$|E
6000|$|He looked, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> at the graves. [...] "Well, {{you know}} what!" [...] But he didn't move, and he {{presently}} produced {{something that made}} me drop straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. [...] "Does my uncle think what YOU think?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited,</b> I {{would not}} reflect. I fixedly {{looked at the}} street-stones, where the door-lamp shone, and counted them and noted their shapes, and the glitter of wet on their angles. I rang again. They opened at last. A bonne in a smart cap stood before me.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, Mr. Todd, is it? Well now, may I ask you: am I {{leaving this}} property, or are you? Don't trouble {{yourself}} to answer that, however, but just attend. Either you draw up that will at once, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait,</b> or you {{say good-bye to}} about Â£2000 a year, for that's what Meeson's business is worth, I reckon. Now you take your choice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under those circumstances, Mr. Noel, you cannot {{possibly}} suspect me {{of conspiring}} to deceive you, with the maid for my instrument. Go into the house, sir, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> here. Ask {{the woman who}} dresses Mrs. Noel Vanstone's hair morning and night whether her mistress has a mark {{on the left side}} of her neck, and (if so) what that mark is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} more to tell," [...] {{she said with a}} shiver. [...] "I was very anxious <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> behind a hummock of ice, but at last I heard the men coming; they were {{carrying}} Lawrence, who couldn't walk. We got him down to the hotel--and I think that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could not}} be sure because of the ceaseless babble of the brook, but the sound seemed like that of sobs. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> the great moon {{appeared}} suddenly above a bank of inky cloud, flooding the place with light, and oh! by that light, looking more ethereal than woman I saw--I saw Marie! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the white}} man," [...] he muttered to himself in his hissing whisper, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> through the {{following}} darkness with the rifle at my shoulder, [...] "the white man who shot me long, long ago, and again he has a gun! Oh! Fate stabs, doubtless the god is dead and I too must die!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{tell me a}} story <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait.</b> Not out of {{that stupid}} play-book you are always reading, but about {{something}} that really happened, with naughty children and nice folks in it, and have it end good," [...] said Ruth, beginning a dandelion chain; for surely {{it is safe to}} believe that our honored grandmothers enjoyed that pretty pastime in their childhood.|$|R
6000|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> was <b>waiting</b> {{the elderly}} woman came in. [...] "Do {{you want the}} boy to take your little bag out and strap it on?" [...] said she.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he's a brick--but the {{question}} now hangs in the balance. Allowing him time to have got into relation with the picture, I've begun to expect his wire, which will probably come to my club; but my fidget, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait,</b> has driven me"--he threw out and dropped his arms in expression of his soft surrender--"well, just to do this: {{to come to you}} here, in my fever, at an unnatural hour and uninvited, and at least let you know I've 'acted.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't {{mind that}} at all. I {{have no right}} to expect {{anything}} else, and I will not wish you to keep away. I liked the man as well as any I ever knew. In short, I would accompany you a part of the way to the place, and smoke a cigar on the stile <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> till you came back." ...|$|E
60|$|Between {{the drives}} of spray Mr. Pike flashed his stick. I heard him exclaim something. Then {{he went on}} to the forecastle-head, {{followed}} by Mr. Mellaire, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> by the foremast, clinging tight, and endured another ducking. Through the emergencies I could see the pencil of light, appearing and disappearing, darting here and there. Several minutes later the mates were back with me.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} old doctor himself drove {{slowly down the}} road in his rickety old buggy. I waved my hand at him and shouted that I would be on hand the next day at the usual time. He stopped his horse and called to Amaryllis to come out to him. They talked for five minutes <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited.</b> Then the old doctor drove on.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is your book," [...] she stammered. [...] "I did {{not know}} that it was yours when I took it down. I--I was looking at it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was <b>waiting</b> for Clarence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, {{but your}} mother {{supplied}} {{me with a}} very good lunch <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was <b>waiting,</b> Ralph," [...] returned the young man. [...] "Don't mind me, but go ahead and enjoy your lunch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not read}} him! But he is {{published}} by the same firm that publishes Home Gossip, and I can't help seeing his cover sometimes <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am <b>waiting</b> {{in the waiting room}} to see the editress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she's grand," [...] {{the young}} man conceded; [...] "she's on the scale, altogether, of the car of Juggernaut which {{was a kind of}} image that came to me {{yesterday}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for her at Lancaster Gate. The things in your drawing-room there were like the forms of the strange idols, the mystic excrescences, with which one may suppose {{the front of the car}} to bristle." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we stopped}} the operation, he {{attended}} to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure {{to my own}} incision. I laid down, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By and by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get {{a glass of wine}} for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the story}} that William Trotter told me {{on the beach at}} Aguas Frescas <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>waited</b> for the gig of the captain of the fruit steamer Andador which was to take me abroad. Reluctantly I was leaving the Land of Always Afternoon. William was remaining, and he favored me with a {{condensed}} oral autobiography as we sat on the sands in the shade cast by the Bodega Nacional.|$|E
5000|$|So <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am <b>waiting</b> {{for more}} dialogue, I {{must say that}} so far, the Bible {{discussion}} I have seen overwhelmingly supports anyone willing to sacrifice everything in order to physically stop an abortionist from killing thousands of babies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got a poem--several of them, in fact," [...] {{answered}} Songbird, [...] "but I didn't {{have those}} {{in mind when}} I spoke. Who do you suppose I met yesterday morning, in Ithaca, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was <b>waiting</b> for the train?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Alpha Omega New's Elise F. {{said that}} [...] "What I've Become, the debut album of rock band Ashes Remain, is part Kutless, part Red, a bit Decyfer Down, and overall {{one of the}} best rock albums to come out yet this year." [...] In addition, Elise F. wrote that [...] "while Ashes Remain is a band that could come across at times as generic both lyrically and musically, they have {{surprising}} talent and a solid sound. I, for one, will definitely be putting this album on repeat <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>wait</b> to see what they come up with next." ...|$|R
