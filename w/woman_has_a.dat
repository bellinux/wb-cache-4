25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare abortion to murder. Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right {{to make decisions about}} her own body.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} some correspondences between the ideas about genius and juno, {{especially}} in the imperial age, the relevant documentation is rather late (Tibullus mentions it first). Dumézil also remarks from these passages one could infer every <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity {{of the concept of}} a juno of women, homologous to the genius of men, is the Arval sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno Deae Diae ("the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia"), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration. While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo, that of a Genius of gods is, and even of a Genius of a goddess, Victoria. On this point it looks remarkable that also in Martianus Capella's division of Heaven a Juno Hospitae Genius is mentioned in region IX, and not a Juno: the sex of this Genius is feminine. See section below for details.|$|E

It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> breaking point, y'all/ Hey, I know you know, some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> breaking point, y'all."

2500|$|An {{argument}} first {{presented by}} Judith Jarvis Thomson states {{that even if}} the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to control her own body and its life-support functions. Thomson's variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person to allow his body to be used to maintain blood homeostasis (as a dialysis machine is used) for another person suffering from kidney failure. [...] It is argued that just as it would be permissible to [...] "unplug" [...] and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body's life-support functions against one's will).|$|E

[...] "Nobody in their right mind," [...] she told the nuns, [...] "is for abortions. I've talked women out of having abortions. I would never have an abortion myself, not in a million years.

[...] Following reports of May's statements, prominent Canadian feminist Judy Rebick announced that she was withdrawing her previous support of May and the Green Party because of May's questioning [...] "the most important victory of the women's movement of my generation". May has since said that her stance has been misreported.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pregnant}} <b>woman</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> different {{pattern of}} [...] "gait". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain {{and changes in}} posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to {{the rotation of the}} hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.|$|E
