40|$|Contemporary {{complexity}} science {{deals with}} problems involving many variables which {{interact with each}} other (and with the environment) {{in such a way that}} new quality appears. Nonlinearity is a cornerstone of complex systems which as a rule are far from equilibrium and exhibit properties of emergence of coherent structures, possibly over many scales. Although nowadays complexity studies stress beside physics and mathematics also biology, chemistry, environment (including weather and climate), social sciences, etc. [1], mechanics is definitely a part of complexity science. Even the earlier studies demonstrate, for example, the complexity of wave motion [2]. Now complexity in mechanical systems has been studied in much more details. Generalized continuum theories incorporate intrinsic microstructural and nonlinear effects in the mechanical behaviour of solids. The concept of internal variables, multiscale approach and hierarchical governing equations allow analysing waves in microstructured solids <b>with</b> <b>clear</b> physical <b>reasoning.</b> The effects like emergence of solitary waves and solitary wave structures, scale-dependence and wave hierarchy clearly demonstrate that the contemporary mechanics exhibits many complex effects which now are intensively studied in other fields. In this talk nonlinear wave propagation in microstructured solids is analysed as a basic example of complexity but some insights to fluid dynamics [3] and biophysics [4] are also given. The basic models are derived from the canonical (material) momentum equation where the interaction forces are clearly separated. Novel concepts like wave hierarchy [5] and dual internal variables [6] are described and several examples together with numerical results are presented...|$|R

Sir Terence alone the one man from whom he might have looked for the greatest relief--watched him ever malevolently, sardonically, with curling lip. It gave him pause now that he stood upon the threshold of falsehood; and because of that inexplicable but obvious hostility, that attitude of expectancy to ensnare and destroy him, Captain Tremayne hesitated to step from the solid ground of reason, upon which he had confidently walked thus far, on to the uncertain bogland of mendacity.|$|R

The typical application is {{to visualize the}} connections in a Bayesian Network learned from data {{to learn more about}} the inherent properties of the system (e. g. in earth sciences, biology or medicine). The paper focuses on measures based on mutual information and conditional mutual information. The goal is to provide an easy-toread document that gives <b>clear</b> <b>reasoning</b> for existing measures, provides some simple extensions (modified measures for different applications), discusses the limitations of the measures, provides enough interpretation to aid a scientist in selecting the most appropriate one and suggests some new uses for link strength...|$|R
40|$|If we {{want the}} best {{academic}} outcomes, the most efficient and cost-effective route to achieve that is, counterintuitively, not to narrowly focus on academics, but to also ad-dress children’s social, emotional, and physical development. Similarly, {{the best and most}} efficient route to physical health is through also addressing emotional, social, and cognitive wellness. Emotional wellness, similarly, depends critically on social, cognitive, and physical wellness. We must always keep our eyes on the goals of education. If the goal of education is not simply the memorization of facts, then we must stop focusing on the memori-zation of facts in our assessment measures, for what gets assessed is what gets em-phasized. If success depends 90 % on attitude and effort, only 10 % on ability, we must foster can-do attitudes and self-confidence in our students.

40|$|The use {{of types}} {{to control the}} {{behavior}} of processes in the pi-calculus is a long known and well established technique. The idea was first introduced by Pierce and Sangiorgi in their seminal work on the subject [9], and is best illustrated by their motivating example: S = (νs) !d〈s〉|!s(x). print〈x 〉 C = d(x). x 〈 j〉 S is a print spooler serving requests from a private channel s that it communicates to its clients via the public channel d. C is one such client, that receives s and uses it to print the job j. While {{the intention of the}} specification is <b>clear,</b> <b>reasoning</b> on its properties is subtler. For instance, given the initial configuration S|C, can we prove that the jobs sent by C are eventually received and printed?

40|$|The {{approach}} {{discussed here}} {{is part of}} research into an overall concept for digital instruments which support the entire planning process and help in enabling planning decisions to be based upon <b>clear</b> <b>reasoning</b> and plausible arguments. Such specialist systems {{must take into account}} currently available technology, such as networked working patterns, object-orientation, building and product models as well as the working method of the planner. The paper describes a plausibility instrument for the formulation of colour scheme proposals for building interiors and elevations. With the help of intuitively usable light simulations, colour, material and spatial concepts can be assessed realistically. The software prototype “Coloured Architecture” is conceived as a professional extension to conventional design tools for the modelling of buildings. As such it can be used by the architect in the earliest design phases of the planning process as well as for colour implementation on location...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the preliminary steps {{that must be}} taken in order to study the problems stemming from overdetermination in the law of state responsibility. Overdetermination, broadly defined, is the existence of multiple causes (multiple wrongdoers, external natural causes, contribution to the injury by the victim and so on) contributing towards a harmful outcome. As relationships among states {{become more and more}} complex, there is a corresponding increase in the complexity of the potentially harmful outcomes of these relationships. The fact that the harm caused may originate in diverse sources (overdetermination) poses challenges to the law of state responsibility. These challenges pertain to most aspects of state responsibility, yet their dimension regarding causality has not been studied in depth. The confusion surrounding causal analysis conducted by international adjudicatory bodies leads to decisions that are not convincing in their determination of responsibility in causal terms. The argument of the article is twofold. First, it holds that the concept of causation in international law is unclear, especially in relation to overdetermination, and it must be clarified. Second, it holds that a clearer concept of causation can provide useful guidance to the decision-making process of international courts and tribunals: the clear and principled application of causal tests will, in turn, lead to <b>clearer</b> <b>reasoning.</b> A <b>clearer</b> judicial <b>reasoning</b> will improve the foreseeability of the judicial outcome, will provide better guidance for the parties before a court and will lead to a fairer judicial process...|$|R

40|$|The same protein {{has been}} observed, through methods of direct assay, to {{localize}} to various compartments of the cell. Finding {{the order in}} which such subcellular localizations take place contributes toward elucidation of protein pathways and protein-protein interactions. On the other hand, incorporation of the hierarchy of cellular compartments organized as a tree allows a more <b>clear</b> <b>reasoning</b> in terms of the paths taken by proteins that localize to multiple overlapping subcellular sites. In this work, we build an ontology to serve as a knowledge repository for localization of fungal proteins to a hierarchy of major subcellular sites and {{the order in which}} such localizations take place. We use this ontology to automatically classify fungal proteins as per their localizations or according to their specific characteristics. Finally, we develop a menu-driven user interface to interact with the constructed ontology.

40|$|The {{issue of}} climate change {{required}} {{the development of the}} Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) by the IPCC. The complexity of the subject and the unique science-policy relation resulted in confusion and discussions appeared in popular media like The Economist. This paper reviews scenario literature and SRES, identifies the most vulnerable elements in the communication of SRES. In the communication of GHG emission scenarios through SRES, the weaknesses that have been identified by the authors of this paper are the normative character {{of climate change}} assessment, the plausibility of the scenarios, and the risk of simplification of complex messages. The causes of these communicative issues have been identified as the intrinsic difficulties of interdisciplinary science, the uniqueness of the science-policy relation, and the need for a high degree of transparency. This paper suggests improving future communication of complex messages from scientists to their audience by means of <b>clear</b> <b>reasoning</b> when communicating <b>with</b> non-scientists, explicitly normative emission scenarios, and increased stakeholder participation in scenario development...|$|R
