500|$|Minutemen {{originally}} recorded an [...] "album's {{worth of}} material" [...] with James in November 1983 in Radio Tokyo Studios. However, after hearing labelmates Hüsker Dü's double album Zen Arcade (1984), {{which had been}} recorded a month earlier, Minutemen decided to write more material. Watt later commented: [...] "It wasn't really a competition even. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> 'Take that Hüskers!" [...] in [...] it was acknowledging that they gave us the idea to make a double album." [...] Unlike Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, Minutemen {{did not have a}} unifying concept, but soon decided that the record's concept would be their cars.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Sensual World" [...] {{has been}} renamed [...] "Flower of the Mountain" [...] and {{contains}} a passage of Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy from James Joyce's novel Ulysses. Bush said, [...] "Originally <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love. I didn't know what I was talking about <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|Former Batman {{writer and}} editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have {{expressed}} disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, [...] "e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective {{in a way that}} didn't involve violence." [...] However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, [...] "Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration." [...] Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that [...] "imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|Refn chose Johnny Jewel of Desire and the Chromatics {{to score}} the film. He wanted {{electronic}} music {{and to have}} it be abstract, on occasion, so viewers can see things from the Driver's perspective. As Refn was going through mixer Jewel's catalog, he picked out [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] and [...] "Tick of the Clock" [...] because he thought of Drive being a fairy tale. During Drives climax, [...] "A Real Hero"'s keynote melody, about becoming [...] "a real human being, and a real hero", refrains because that is when the Driver displays both those characteristics. At first, Jewel worried that [...] "Under Your Spell" [...] might be too literal, but soon realized it is used in Drive [...] "in the exact same way that I was feeling it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it. He definitely got the nuance of the song, and understood what {{it was supposed to}} mean, and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer, that same feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 22, Dylan {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time at Carnegie Hall, part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad [...] "Lord Randall". [...] "Hard Rain" [...] would gain added resonance one month later, when President Kennedy appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the sleeve notes on the Freewheelin album, Nat Hentoff quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote [...] "Hard Rain" [...] in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: [...] "Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one". In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 {{asked about the}} Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never so much as touched a PC <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Made It" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Tye Tribbett and David Outing. Prior to its release on her album The Definition Of... (2016), Fantasia {{had played a}} portion of the song on Periscope and revealed to her fans that she worked with Tribbett. In the video, she incorrectly reported that she had handled the songwriting by herself. Tribbett explained its concept and his collaboration with Fantasia to Christine Thomasos of The Christian Post, saying: [...] "We've been talking about working together for a minute. So when the opportunity came {{it was kind of like}} a no brainer". He said that he instantly agreed to work with Fantasia after receiving a phone call to write a song for her. Fantasia had contacted Tribbett at the suggestion of music executive Ron Fair. Prior to the writing process, Tribbett had asked to [...] "do it on [...] terms" [...] and [...] "maintain the integrity of his message" [...] by creating an inspirational gospel record. He used Fantasia's testimony, as well as his own experiences with God, as inspiration for the lyrics. He described the song as the result of a close connection between Fantasia and himself: [...] "I basically just combined testimonies between her and myself <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the song and it resonated so richly with her, her audience and with everybody." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Several later {{commentators}} have interpreted the {{play as a}} reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who [...] "never thought of things as right or wrong". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand [...] "found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism" [...] because of the influence on her of [...] "Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [...] changed criminals into heroes". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as [...] "an eloquent symbol" [...] of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, [...] "I do not think, nor did I think <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> this play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play [...] "a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview" [...] of the superiority of the [...] "superman"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the [...] "slave morality" [...] of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand [...] "later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her.|$|E
500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

5000|$|On his {{philosophy}} towards composing, Evans has stated, “...Writing a song {{is a bit}} one-sided as far as perspective goes… <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> for TV and film, it’s not just self expression.

6000|$|That {{career had}} its own hidden side, of course; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> of these unseen factors I do not mean that but {{something}} altogether broader.
