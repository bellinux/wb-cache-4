5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
25|$|The Penny Black lasted {{less than}} a year. A red {{cancellation}} <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> on the black design and the red ink was easy to remove; both {{made it possible to}} re-use cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective and harder to remove. However, people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order.|$|E
2500|$|The Somerset county {{historian}} and journalist David Foot wrote: [...] "He was a personable {{rather than an}} astute captain. Some of the committee found him a rather too convenient scapegoat. A former player said: 'It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who was around to take over from Ben (Brocklehurst). Gerry was a goodish player but {{he still had a}} bad side around him. It was terribly unjust that he should have been blamed as much as he was'." ...|$|E

2500|$|This was {{the first}} matchup between Eastern Washington and BYU. [...] Corby Hodgkiss took a 39-yard {{touchdown}} interception on Eastern Washington's first drive. [...] Bryan Kehl and Quinn Gooch also came away with an interception each. Due to weather and an early defensive touchdown, BYU went away from the pass fairly early. The final quarter {{was one of the}} shortest in recent memory as the refs were very liberal with the clock. This was mostly due to the fact the score was 42-7 and there was a blizzard. The last 10 minutes in the game it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the field yet the cougar faithful cheered loudly until the end.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} {{travellers}} avoided the Risley (Birchwood) area because it of its dangerous mossland, however gradually over time {{much of the}} fertile mossland was reclaimed and turned into farm land. With {{the advent of the}} Second World War, 927 acres (3.8kmÂ²) of agricultural land was changed into a massive Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Risley. The location was chosen because the low lying mist and cloud helped camouflage the factory from the air; according to a local builder: [...] "It was very lonely and misty at night, and that's why the factory was constructed there ... it was usually covered with a mist or cloud. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it in the day time, you know". Although the location of the factory was known by the German Luftwaffe, the factory was bombed only once during the war.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1971, the Gnat {{proved to}} be a {{frustrating}} opponent for the larger, heavier and older Sabre. The Gnat was referred to as a [...] "Sabre Slayer" [...] by the IAF since most of its combat [...] "kills" [...] during the two wars were against Sabres. The Canadair Sabre Mk 6 was widely regarded as the best dogfighter of its era. [...] Tactics called for Gnats taking on the Sabres in the vertical arena, where the Sabres were at a disadvantage. As the Gnat was lightweight and compact in shape, it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> especially at the low levels where most dogfights took place. Apart from air defence operations, they performed multiple roles in the Bangladesh Liberation War, including anti-shipping operations, ground attack, bomber/transport escort and close air support with devastating effects on the PAF.|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} the walk, Wallenda {{said it was}} more difficult than he had expected. [...] "That mist was thick. It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back." [...] Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below {{made it difficult for}} him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather [...] "Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving... can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it." [...] He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity [...] "like none other in history." [...] Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked [...] "aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before." [...] Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act.|$|E
