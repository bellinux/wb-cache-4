The chemical waste that pollutes the environment {{is a serious problem}} and supplied by industrial activities such as plywood factory. Basically the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> is not a difficult activities but the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> requires the application of accurate <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> method. This research aims to study the {{solid and liquid}} <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> system and analysis of liquid waste effluent quality on plywood glue factory in Langsa city in 2012. This research is adescriptive survey study by using observation sheet on solid and liquid <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> in plywood factory and the inspection of liquid waste sampel in effluent point and <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant influent and the recycled liquid waste. The results of observation indicates that the solid <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> system in plywood factory use the incineration method, reuse of urea bag. The liquid <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> in plywood factory uses the sendimentation and aeratoin process. The result of laboratory analysis of liquid waste effluent is : COD 51, 2 ppm, Temp 27 ºC, Amonia (NH 3) 0, 1 ppm, TSS 3, 7 ppm, Phenol 0 ppm, BOD 5 25, 5 ppm and pH 6, 9.

40|$|The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System {{provides}} the space, layout, structures, and embedded subsystems {{that support the}} processing of low-level liquid and solid radioactive waste generated within the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR). The activities conducted in the <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building include sorting, volume reduction, and packaging of dry waste, and collecting, processing, solidification, and packaging of liquid <b>waste.</b> The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System {{is located on the}} surface within the protected area of the MGR. The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System helps maintain a suitable environment for the waste processing and protects the systems within the <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building (WTB) from most of the natural and induced environments. The WTB also confines contaminants and provides radiological protection to personnel. In addition to the waste processing operations, the <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System provides space and layout for staging of packaged waste for shipment, industrial and radiological safety systems, control and monitoring of operations, safeguards and security systems, and fire protection, ventilation and utilities systems. The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System also {{provides the}} required space and layout for maintenance activities, tool storage, and administrative facilities. The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System integrates waste processing systems within its protective structure to support the throughput rates established for the MGR. The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System also provides shielding, layout, and other design features to help limit personnel radiation exposures to levels which are as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System interfaces with the Site Generated Radiological Waste Handling System, and with other MGR systems that support the waste processing operations. The <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building System interfaces with the General Site Transportation System, Site Communications System, Site Water System, MGR Site Layout, Safeguards and Security System, Site Radiological Monitoring System, Site Electrical Power System, Site Compressed Air System, and <b>Waste</b> <b>Treatment</b> Building Ventilation System...|$|R
40|$|A {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{a specific}} <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique is very important factor when making the decision {{to invest in a}} <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> facility. <b>Waste</b> <b>treatment</b> can bring economic benefit through the value of product: recycled materials, the compost, the generated electricity, or heat. However, the expected economic benefits depend on many factors: the investment costs and operating costs of the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> facility, revenues, the market price of the product obtained by <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> etc. The investment and operating costs and the revenue also depend on the amount of treated waste. This paper presents a mathematical model for evaluation of cost-effectiveness in the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique with energy recovery depending on the amount of waste, i. e. evaluation the minimum amount of waste to be treated for a cost-effective <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> technique with energy recovery. To develop the mathematical model, a socio-economic analysis was used. The model is applied to calculate the lower limit of cost-effectiveness in the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques with energy recovery: incineration and anaerobic digestion, in the city of Nis, Serbia, as a case study. The obtained results show that the amount of waste currently generated in the city of Nis is not sufficient for the cost-effective incineration treatment, but with the currently available amount of waste, anaerobic digestion is the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> that can be operated without losses in the city of Nis...|$|R

30|$|Here, I {{would like}} to {{consider}} the significance of a sustainable equilibrium {{in the context of}} producer’s responsibility for waste generation. Notice that <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> charges are included in production costs in this equilibrium. Of course, the <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> charges are reflected in the price of the consumption commodity. Thus, although households do not have to pay for <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> directly, they pay indirectly, since those costs are reflected in the production price. In other words, households are supposed pay for <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> of an ELP (end-of-life product) in advance when they buy the relevant commodity or product.|$|R

Evaluation models are applied to estimate the treatment and environmental costs in the current <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> system. This study shows that the contribution of carbon dioxide and methane gases from the current <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> system in Bangkok, Thailand to the greenhouse effect is large.

40|$|Vegetable {{industries}} {{have been considered}} responsible for {{a great amount of}} pollution; hence, there has been a strong need for the optimization of vegetable <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> systems. The currently employed systems are numerous and fall in the following large categories; thermal processes, evaporation, membrane processes, anaerobic digestion, anaerobic codigestion, biodiesel spraying, combustion, transesterification, coagulation, and composting. Respective methodologies in conjunction with <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> methods were presented per <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> method. The comparative presentation of the various vegetable <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> methodologies showed that though anaerobic digestion stands for the most enviromentally friendly technique; its required longer treatment time in conjuction with its weakness to deal with elemental contaminants makes imperative the employment of a second alternative technique which could either be a membrane process (low energy cost, reliability, reduced capital cost) or a coagulation/flocculation method because of its low cost and high effectiveness. Biogas production appears to be another promising and energy effective <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> method. On the other hand, methods like distillation and ozonation (high cost) and electrolysis (experimental level) have not been employed in the field.
