50|$|In 1823 {{a replica}} Carnot <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} at Woolwich, Kent to test Carnot's theories. This <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 21 ft high and 22 ft long. The tapering <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 7 ft thick {{at its base}} and 6 ft thick at the top. A rampart of equal height with the <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> built {{in front of it}} to represent that of a real fort. The idea was that the gunners would be unable to see the wall itself when firing.|$|R

5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane.

The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
