Measuring the weather using conventional or manually operated <b>Weather</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Stations requires skilled labor for operation and demands regular maintenance which invariably increases the life cycle cost of the <b>Weather</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Station. To address these issues, {{the authors of this}} paper have attempted to design and implement inexpensive Wireless Portable <b>Weather</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Station using PIC 16 F 887 microcontroller. The implemented <b>Weather</b> <b>Monitoring</b> Station is equipped with sensors to measure weather variables such as relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction, surface and ambient temperature. Besides of these capabilities, the designed <b>Weather</b> <b>Monitoring</b> station also includes some unique features like Modbus communication protocol, which provides seamlessly communication of real time weather measurements to the base station (PC Laptop) over both wired (RS serial) and wireless (Xbee Pro modules) interfaces. Further, at the base station, the received data is logged and uploaded to an online data server to enable worldwide ubiquitous access to the weather measurements. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|There is {{continues}} {{capture of}} large streaming data vital for application such as intensive health care system, Sensor networks, Object tracking etc.,.

The identification of anomalies such as abnormalities in Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) of an heart patient, predicting future casualties in <b>weather</b> <b>monitor</b> monitoring system, and providing heuristics in object tracking has to be effectively carried out. To achieve this we propose Identification of Anomalies in Time Series Data using Similarity Join Processing (IATSJ) to identify the anomalies by using Alternate Multilevel Segment Mean (AMSM) technique which reduces the data dimension and applying similarity join processing on these reduced data using sliding window concept.

30|$|Concerning the longer-term perspectives, {{biologists}} {{are interested}} in high-level applications such as abnormal behavior detection. Such applications include many parameters and require robust models from which observations can then be compared. In this context, the environmental platform presented in Section 1 offers encouraging perspectives. Thanks to the modules under development (e.g., air quality monitors) and existing modules (e.g., counter, <b>weather</b> <b>monitor),</b> information of a different nature could be compared and used to model behavior. On the one hand, low-level behavior models could focus on individual bee trajectories, for example, a tracker that takes into consideration environmental parameters to adapt motion models for estimation. On the other hand, more general models could focus on colony activity such as abnormal colony behavior based on some simple rules (e.g., low activity during a sunny day). The authors of [31] demonstrated that the composition of agricultural landscapes influences life history traits of honeybee workers. It {{would be interesting to}} find a correlation between their observations and individual or general behavior detected in the trajectories of bees.|$|E

40|$|When Einstein {{formulated}} General Relativity, he made numerous predictions {{including the}} existence of gravitational waves. Until now, though, they have been impossible to detect. LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, has been built to overcome this. Major difficulties arise {{as a result of}} the fact that gravitational waves are inherently weak; LIGO is expected to detect stretching on the order of 10 - 18 meters. With the need for such precise measurements, a very large number of unwanted effects have to be minimized. Thus, physical environmental effects must be monitored with care and analyzed. Among the tools needed are a <b>weather</b> <b>monitor,</b> accelerometers and seismometers, and vacuum monitors. Each of these devices must be connected to the network and queried by the database, and the data coming from them must be analyzed. In order to accomplish all this, we must setup the hardware; write code to query each device and format the data; create GUIs to display the data; and design data analysis programs. Such systems have been designed and built for the two LIGO observatory sites. In this project I implement a Physical Environmental Monitoring system for the Caltech 40 -meter Interferometer Prototype Laboratory, and analyze the data obtained...|$|E

We evaluated if daily mean temperature and standard deviation of temperature was associated with heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, a marker of ventricular repolarization in a prospective cohort of older men. Methods: This longitudinal analysis included 487 older men participating in the VA Normative Aging Study with up to three visits between 2000 – 2008 (n = 743). We analyzed associations between QTc and moving averages (1 – 7, 14, 21, and 28 days) of the 24 -hour {{mean and standard deviation}} of temperature as measured from a local <b>weather</b> <b>monitor,</b> and the 24 -hour mean temperature estimated from a spatiotemporal prediction model, in time-varying linear mixed-effect regression. Effect modification by season, diabetes, coronary heart disease, obesity, and age was also evaluated. Results: Higher mean temperature as measured from the local monitor, and estimated from the prediction model, was associated with longer QTc at moving averages of 21 and 28 days. Increased 24 -hr standard deviation of temperature was associated with longer QTc at moving averages from 4 and up to 28 days; a 1. 9 uC interquartile range increase in 4 -day moving average standard deviation of temperature was associated with a 2. 8 msec (95 %CI: 0. 4, 5. 2) longer QTc.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{airborne}} atmospheric pressure measurements using new fiber-based laser {{technology and the}} oxygen A-band at 765 nm. Remote measurements of atmospheric temperature and pressure are required {{for a number of}} NASA Earth science missions and specifically for the Active Sensing of CO 2 Emissions Over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. Accurate measurements of tropospheric CO 2 on a global scale are very important in order to better understand its sources and sinks and to improve predictions on any future climate change. The ultimate goal of a CO 2 remote sensing mission, such as ASCENDS, is to derive the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere in terms of mole fraction in unit of parts-per-million (ppmv) with regard to dry air. Therefore, both CO 2 and the dry air number of molecules in the atmosphere are needed in deriving this quantity. O 2 is a stable molecule and uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Measuring the O 2 absorption in the atmosphere can thus be used to infer the dry air number of molecules and then used to calculate CO 2 concentration. With the knowledge of atmospheric water vapor, we can then estimate the total surface pressure needed for CO 2 retrievals. Our work, funded by the ESTO IIP program, uses fiber optic technology and non-linear optics to generate 765 nm laser radiation coincident with the Oxygen A-band. Our pulsed, time gated technique uses several on- and off-line wavelengths tuned to the O 2 absorption line. The choice of wavelengths allows us to measure the pressure by using two adjacent O 2 absorptions in the Oxygen A-band. Our retrieval algorithm fits the O 2 lineshapes and derives the pressure. Our measurements compare favorably with a local <b>weather</b> <b>monitor</b> mounted outside our laboratory and a local weather station...|$|E
