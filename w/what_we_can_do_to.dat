[...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E

She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too?

2500|$|On Wednesday 24 March 2012, 14 year-old Noah Crooks {{was accused}} of {{shooting}} his 32-year-old mother with a [...]22 caliber rifle after a failed attempt to rape her. Noah was charged with first-degree murder and assault. During the dispatch call to 911 shortly following the murder, Crooks revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his Call of Duty video game because his grades had turned poor {{and that this was}} the reason why he snapped. According to dispatch, Noah Crooks did not seem emotional even though he had murdered his mother a couple of hours earlier. On the night of April 14, 2012, in Clydebank, Scotland, a 13-year-old boy slashed his friend's throat after a session of Gears of War 3. The wound was deep enough to expose his trachea and required 20 staples after his surgery. In March 2013, Brian Docherty, a chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, commented that [...] "These games are rated 18 and shouldn't be played by children of this young age" [...] and that [...] "We need to look again at <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> [...]" [...] Similar and other effects were denounced in 2004 by Gary Webb in his article The Killing Game, exposing the use of increased reality video games by the US Army.|$|E
2500|$|Klass's {{modus operandi}} {{when dealing with}} opponents such as Friedman was exceptional. [...] He seemed to have an acute {{understanding}} of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him. [...] When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass {{wrote a letter to}} A.G. McNamara with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics at the National Research Council in Ottawa. [...] For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [...] The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as [...] "meteorite" [...] or [...] "non-meteorite" [...] and filed them. [...] The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring [...] "bad tidings" [...] - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada. [...] Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups. [...] He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs. [...] Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us." [...] The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the Public Archives of Canada. [...] Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.|$|E
2500|$|The {{versions}} of the game for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One have better graphics and more memory than their counterparts for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. When discussing the additional power of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, John Vignocchi stated [...] "I’d say, specifically related to Xbox One, the graphical prowess of that system is incredible. So, we’re looking at <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make sure the game looks incredible on [...] From a features perspective, I’d say the thing we’re most excited about is that players {{are going to be}} able to create Toy Boxes now that are much, much larger than they were before," [...] and [...] "In terms of what we're doing with , we're planning on making use of the graphical prowess of those machines — they can pump out some amazing-looking graphics. In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit." [...] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 {{versions of}} the game are more advanced than the others, as executive producer John Vignocchi said [...] "one of the most unique features of Disney Infinity 2.0 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just because of the memory footprint of those systems, is that the size of the toy boxes you can create are just gigantic." [...] The game engine is improved and expanded.|$|E
