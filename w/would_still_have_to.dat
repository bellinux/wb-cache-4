5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he had selected Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, {{although there is no}} evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the aforementioned decision, the civil registrar of the municipality of Navojoa announced that same-sex couples <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be granted an injunction {{to be able to}} marry in the municipality. He claimed that because the Congress of Sonora had not yet changed the law, an amparo was still necessary.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eve of}} Henry's {{possible}} punishment {{being discussed}} at the FIFA EGM, FFF technical director Gérard Houllier defended Henry, stating the handball was instinctive and that the blame lay with the referee, pointing out that had the goal not been scored, the match <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> gone <b>to</b> penalties. Houllier also called for the introduction of video refereeing.|$|R

Though not accessible via the SPAN link, the appliance would be accessible via the management link.|$|R
25|$|On 4 March, {{at press}} conference in Novo-Ogaryovo President Putin {{expressed}} his view on the situation that if a revolution took place in Ukraine, {{it is a new}} country with which Russia did not conclude any treaties. He brought up an analogy with events of 1917 in Russia, when {{as a result of the}} revolution the Russian Empire fell apart and a new state was created. However, he stated Ukraine <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> honour its debts.|$|E
25|$|Plunkett's {{task was}} frustrating. He {{was a pioneer}} {{of the concept of}} {{systematic}} rural development, who, in spite of his role in Irish affairs being often overlooked, influenced many international reformers, and can be credited {{as one of the few}} who had a long-term vision for the development of rural Ireland. He was apt to remind audiences that, even if full peasant proprietorship was achieved and Home Rule was implemented, rural underdevelopment <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be faced. But class conflict between farmers and shopkeepers intervened to frustrate much of what he aimed to do.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{allowed for}} a less arduous method of certification for religious teachers in which they <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> complete examinations but {{would not have to}} attend Normal School classes. The determination of textbook content would be made in consultation with the churches, with passages offensive to the church excised. Church-owned school buildings would be permitted to be used, pending the decision by local school trustees to lease them from the church, and religious instruction could occur in such buildings if the regular school day was not shortened for the purpose. The effect of the arrangements regarding church buildings and religious schooling was to limit Catholic education to urban centres and to move further argument back down {{to the level of the}} local school boards.|$|E

5000|$|After initial {{confusion}} as {{to whether}} non-Freeview devices <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> the EPG, Freeview confirmed the broadcast EPG would remain.

50|$|There {{had been}} {{discussion}} since 2003 {{of building a}} separate venue for the Royals, which also could have been shared by Creighton University and/or the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Royals president and part owner Alan Stein stated {{he would be willing}} to invest $10 million into a new 7,500 seat stadium for the Royals. Although initial plans called for TD Ameritrade Park to be reduced to 12,000 seats for Royals games, Stein said that would not be a viable alternative, presumably because the Royals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go on an extended road trip in June during the CWS. The Royals believed that a smaller, more intimate stadium would double annual attendance up to 500,000-600,000. According to Stein, that increase would have been unlikely at either Rosenblatt or a large downtown stadium.|$|R
25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, of course, to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel {{down the length of}} the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008 the Latvian {{government}} imposed {{budget cuts}} on LTV of over 2 million Lats (over €3 million). Because of this LTV {{were forced to}} cancel many planned shows for 2009, including Eirodziesma. On 17 December 2008, LTV confirmed that they had requested to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organisers of Eurovision, their withdrawal from the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, due solely to the budget cuts that hindered the Latvian broadcaster from paying the participation fee for Eurovision. After their intent {{was given to the}} EBU, talks between the two parties began for a way that LTV could participate in the contest. However, their withdrawal request occurred 3 days after the deadline for participation, and it was rumoured that LTV <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay the participation because the deadline had passed. On 20 December 2008, LTV confirmed their withdrawal from the contest, having no penalty for withdrawing past the deadline. However, on 12 January 2009 the final participants list for the 2009 contest was released, that confirmed Latvia will participate.|$|E
25|$|Self-replicating probes could exhaustively {{explore a}} galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way in as little as a million years. If even a single civilization in the Milky Way {{attempted}} this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.|$|E

25|$|When the European Union {{introduced}} {{new security}} rules for airports from 1 January 2005, Brekstad Airport was exempt, {{because of the}} small size of the aircraft. By April, the airport had received notice that 100% security control <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be introduced, costing the municipality NOK465,000 per year. At the same time, Air Norway was still losing money, and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport. On 3 September 2007, the terminal was renovated for NOK1.8 million. It received a segregation of arriving and departing passengers, 100% security control and a general renovation of the building, although the capacity was not increased. In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 passengers after the Norwegian Air Force decided to not permit their employees to travel from Brekstad, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about two hours drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone in relation to the Norwegian, caused Air Norway to have lost NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a public service obligation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1958–59 Scottish League Cup group stage Hearts {{eliminated}} Rangers. That October 1958 Scottish League Cup Final was {{won with}} a heavy 5–1 defeat of Partick Thistle. Bauld and Murray each scored two and Johnny Hamilton netted one. Hearts defended their league title by being leaders in mid December. However a side visiting Ibrox missing injured Mackay were beaten 5–0 with all goals in the first 35 minutes. This put Rangers into top position in the table on goal average. This precipitated a poor run of only two wins from the next seven games without injured Mackay. Hearts beat Queen of the South in a 2–1 home league win on 7 March 1959. After that QoS game Rangers with six games to play were firm favourites for the title, six points ahead of second placed Hearts. Even if Hearts were to win their remaining seven games including a game in hand and beating Rangers in their visit Tynecastle in Rangers' penultimate game of the season, Rangers <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> drop two points elsewhere and give away a superior goal average. The league game against QoS was Mackay's last for Hearts after they accepted a bid of £32,000 from Tottenham Hotspur for their captain who was fit at this time despite having had lengthy spells out injured in the previous 12 months. Bobby Rankin {{was brought in to}} bolster the squad and scored twice in each of his first two games (both victories). On the penultimate Saturday of the league campaign goals by Cumming and Rankin at home to Rangers meant Hearts were four points behind with a game in hand. In midweek they next won 4–2 at Aberdeen with Rankin scoring a hat-trick. The last day of the season began with Rangers two points clear with an identical goal average to Hearts. Rangers thus needed a point to clinch the title but lost 2–1 at home to Aberdeen. Despite missing Bobby Kirk at right back with a knee injury, Rankin's ninth goal from his fifth Hearts game had Hearts 1–0 up at half time at Celtic Park. Any victory would have given Hearts the title. Then Celtic's Bertie Auld playing at left wing equalised before Eric Smith scored Celtic's winning second goal to seal the title for their cross city rivals leaving those at the Tynecastle to wonder {{what would have happened if}} Mackay hadn't been sold when he was.|$|E

500|$|As was the custom, Congress {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} draft a preamble to explain {{the purpose of the}} resolution.

Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under proprietary governance. Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest. Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be made.|$|E
