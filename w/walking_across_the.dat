At about 8:10a.m., he is shown <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> street to a supermarket and returning with bread and {{two cups of}} coffee. Around 8:45a.m., he is seen leaving the hotel alone with his bags.|$|E
5|$|The Portishead line again saw {{a rise in}} {{use during}} the Second World War, as Bristolians {{evacuated}} to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work, many alighting at Clifton Bridge and <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland Basin bridges, the Rownham Ferry now obsolete. During air raids, people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings, or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station. The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands, loaded onto trains {{by members of the}} Women's Land Army. Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E

5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> leads of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E

25|$|Ötzi's {{clothes were}} sophisticated. He wore a cloak made of woven grass and a coat, a belt, {{a pair of}} leggings, a loincloth and shoes, all made of leather of {{different}} skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, leggings and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, drill, flint flake, bone awl and a dried fungus.|$|E

25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room. The problem is that if there is something totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E
25|$|In the men's race, the Brownlee brothers, Alistair and Johnathan, and Gómez {{exited the}} swim first and quickly formed, with eight others, an eleven-man {{breakaway}} group. At {{the end of}} the first bike lap, the breakaway had accumulated a 20-second lead. Olympic Champion Jan Frodeno bridged the gap and the now 12-man breakaway pushed on to the run section with a two-minute lead. On the run, the Brownlees separated themselves from the pack, along with Gómez. However, Gómez fell off the pace and the finish became a one-on-one duel between the brothers. In the final kilometre, Alistair kicked away from Jonathan before stopping in the finishing straight and <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> line with his brother, with Johnathan making sure that Alistair crossed first. It was the first time that both brothers had appeared on the podium and it was Alistair's third straight win in Madrid. Gómez's third place kept him at the top of the overall standings, five points ahead of Jonathan. Polyansky, who finished fifth in Madrid, rounded out the top three in the overall standings. With his win, Alistair jumped up 20 places in the standings to fifth place in the overall standings.|$|E
500|$|Hosseini {{first began}} to {{consider}} the plot of And the Mountains Echoed during a 2007 trip to Afghanistan with the UN Refugee Agency. While there, he heard stories from several village elders about the deaths of young, impoverished children during the winters, which gave {{the foundation for the}} fundamental event of the novel: a parent's choice to sell a child to prevent this from occurring. [...] "The novel began very, very small, and it began with a single image in my head that I simply could not shed," [...] he relayed. [...] "It was the image of a man <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> desert and he's pulling a little Radio Flyer red wagon, and in it there's a little girl about 3 years old, and there's a boy walking behind him, and these three people are <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> desert." [...] Hosseini originally planned for it to be written in a linear fashion similar to his previous novels, but, during the writing process, it was expanded to cover a series of interconnected stories surrounding a large number of characters not directly related to each other. Comparing the process to a tree, he stated that story [...] "just branched out" [...] and [...] "got bigger and bigger as it went along".|$|E

500|$|The films {{also contain}} {{elements}} of visual humour: when Jaws is {{dropped into a}} shark pool in The Spy Who Loved Me, it is Jaws who bites the shark. The following film, Moonraker, sees Bond in a comic chase scene with a gondola that becomes a hovercraft, a continuation that Bond author Raymond Benson considered [...] "so dumb that one wonders at what age group the film was really aimed." [...] The music and sound effects are also used for comic effect in the films: the laboratory of Hugo Drax is opened by touchtones that play the tune of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, whilst when Bond and Anya are seen <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> desert in The Spy Who Loved Me, the theme from Lawrence of Arabia is heard.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E

500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with.

Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear (aged 23 and 24, respectively) were {{attacked}} on the Eastbank Esplanade on May 22, 2011, after holding hands while <b>walking</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Details {{of the attack}} were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from Tom McCall Waterfront Park across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade. According to the description released by Portland Police, [...] "as [...] walked they knew several men were behind them talking, laughing and pointing {{but they were not}} sure it was directed at them." [...] Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call 9-1-1. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled that he did not hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form. Police investigated the case as a [...] "bias crime", noting the lack of provocation. The five men who attacked Forkner and Rosevear have so far not been identified.|$|E
