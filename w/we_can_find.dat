So we look to find that love where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

25|$|This {{gives us}} an abelian hidden {{subgroup}} problem, as f corresponds to a group homomorphism. The kernel corresponds to modular multiples of (r,1). So, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> the kernel, we can findr.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} to rectify our reasonings is to make them as {{tangible}} {{as those of the}} Mathematicians, so that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate , without further ado, to see who is right.|$|E
25|$|If A admits {{a totally}} ordered cofinal subset, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a subset B which is well-ordered and cofinal in A. Any subset of B is also well-ordered.

The effect is a reflection combined with a translation parallel to the mirror. No points are left fixed.|$|E
25|$|Considering the {{enclosed}} regions as point sets, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> {{the area of}} {{the enclosed}} point set.

25|$|Also, a more {{detailed}} description about the cosmos, Stars, Sun, Moon and the Earth {{can be found in}} the Orphism, which dates back to the end of the 5th century BC, and it is probably even older.

25|$|Latinate Galician {{charters}} {{from the}} 8th century onward {{show that the}} local written Latin was heavily influenced by local spoken romance, yet not until the 12th century that do we find evidences for {{the identification of the}} local language as a language different from Latin itself. During this same 12th century <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> full Galician sentences being inadvertently used inside Latin texts, whilst its first reckoned use as a literary language dates to the last years of the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Political {{science is}} a late arrival {{in terms of}} social sciences. However, the {{discipline}} has a clear set of antecedents such as moral philosophy, political philosophy, political economy, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of government. The roots of politics are in prehistory.

25|$|This form {{suggests}} that if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary {{can be related to}} the study of the level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E
25|$|Given a field k, every k-vector space Q is an {{injective}} k-module. Reason: if Q is a subspace of V, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a {{basis of}} Q and extend it to {{a basis of}} V. The new extending basis vectors span a subspace K of V and V is the internal direct sum of Q and K.

Finding corroboration of the criminal's work history is more difficult: since in the 18th century work relations underwent fundamental changes and much work was casual, seasonal or conducted outside of traditional juridical standards, written documents attesting work transactions are hard to come by. Still, where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> some external evidence it confirms the condemned account.|$|E
