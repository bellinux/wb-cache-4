By 3 D {{finite element}} {{simulation}} for temperature field and tool wear of SiCp/Al metal matrix composites under {{the condition of}} high speed milling, we draw a conclusion that the most significant influence on cutting temperature is cutting speed, less is feed rates, the minimum is cutting depth, which {{is exactly the same}} as the influence law of ordinary metal cutting. In the course of high-speed milling SiCp/Al by PCD tools, the higher the cutting speed is, the bigger <b>wearing</b> <b>depth</b> of tools is. When v= 300 m/min, ap= 0. 5 mm, f= 0. 3 mm/r, the transient temperature in the milling would reach to 619 ℃. Such a high temperature can cause graphitizing wear of the PCD tools. Because of the effectiveness of the simulation’s conclusion, it is vital significance to the reasonable options of cutting parameters and the prolongation of tool life...|$|E
40|$|Overhead {{contact line}} {{equipment}} is important equipment that supplies power to trains. In order thus {{to maintain the}} soundness of the equipment, we inspect <b>wearing</b> <b>depth</b> of contact wires and positions (height and deviation) of overhead contact lines {{a few times a}} year using inspection cars. Some equipment, however, cannot be measured by inspection cars, so that is measured or just visually checked and manually measured only about once a year. One way to acquire accurate information of the condition of such equipment is by shortening the inspection period, but that would be quite difficult to implement due to a considerable increase in the amount of work. Furthermore, some items such as temperature of compression joints of feeders and displacement of springs of STBs constantly vary according to load current and weather. Depending on the timing of the inspection, {{we may not be able}} to check the items at their poorest condition. We thus developed an overhead contact line equipment monitoring system where equipment measurement devices attached to overhead contact lines periodically measure temperature and displacement and transmit that measurement data to trains running there in commercial operation. In this way, the monitoring system enables highly frequent inspection. In this article, we will give an overview of the system and report on some of the field test results...|$|E
40|$|Among train track {{equipment}} that feeds power to train cars, contact wires make {{direct contact with}} train cars ' currency collectors to feed power into the vehicle. Mechanical contacts with currency collectors cause wear on the contact wires, therefore, their <b>wearing</b> <b>depth</b> is always monitored such that proper functionality of the equipment can be maintained by replacing wires that have worn deeper than the specified reference value. Since contact wires do not wear evenly, parts that are worn more than others {{are the first to}} be replaced in existing lines. This will then lead to the necessity of connecting contact wires in the middle. Conventionally, contact wires were arranged in parallel and fixed with double ear fittings (double ear connections) as seen in Figure 1. However, double ear connections had the following structural features: 1) double ear fittings are heavy, weighing about 450 g to 800 g (depending on the wire format), 2) for each connected part, three fittings must be installed with an interval of approximately 30 cm, and 3) two contact wires must be arranged in parallel. These features have been a safety concern since these structural features would lead to problems including lowering of power collecting capabilities at the connected parts and wearing of wires. For these reasons, contact wires are not connected in the middle by double ear fittings for Shinkansen; entire sections between anchors are replaced, even though wear is localized. Therefore, as a new contact wire connection method to replace the double ear connection method, we focused on the cold pressure welding method, developed a device for carrying out such cold pressure welding, and examined the wear of welded parts of actual operating equipment. This document reports the results of the development and examination activities. 2. 1 Overview of contact wire cold pressure welding Figure 2 shows an overview of contact wire cold pressure welding. In this welding procedure, first make sure that wire surfaces to be welded do not have any impurities (water, grease, and so on) other than oxide layers, and then fix the wires on dies in a manner such that the surfaces face to each other. Second, press the fixed contact wires against each other firmly to push out the welded surfaces through plasti...|$|E

40|$|Formulae {{are derived}} from first {{principles}} which predict the <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> of a ball and a flat surface through time as they slide against each other, in relation to any phenomenological law for wear volume, and {{taking into account the}} effect of component geometry. The equations can be fit using experimental wear volume data from ball-on-flat tribometers.

The current paper uses the formulae derived to predict the <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> of a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating and a steel ball as they slide against each other in deionised water. An Archard equation is used to predict the wear volume of each surface; however, a DLC coating is known to form a transfer layer which reduces the rate of wear, and since this scenario does not obey Archard’s law directly, a time-dependent-specific wear rate is used to fit a semi-empirical model to experimental results.

40|$|Aimed at {{studying}} the casing wear {{in the highly}} deviated well drilling, the experimental study on the casing wear {{was carried out in}} the first place. According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint–casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for casing wear mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the <b>wear</b> <b>depth,</b> exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the casing wear process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the maximum casing <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> with time was obtained.

30|$|In summary, we perform MD {{simulations}} {{to investigate}} the atomic scale origin of the minimum <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> of single crystalline Cu(111) during single asperity friction. Simulation results show that scratching impression can only be made under a scratching depth at which there are permanent defects formed.

The specific permanent defects governing the wear phenomena are composed of stair-rod dislocations and prismatic dislocation loops as well as vacancies. While the contact pressure for the nucleation of initial dislocation is independent on probe radius, the minimum <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> increases with probe radius. Further analysis of the shear strain distribution implies that a larger probe results in more compliant deformation of the material, which leads to larger volume of wear debris and wider extent of defect structures.|$|R
