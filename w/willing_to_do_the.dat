5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
25|$|The North–South Expressway was {{constructed}} {{due to the}} congestion along the Federal Route 1 {{as a result of}} the increasing traffic of the FT1. In 1977, the government proposed to build a new north–south divided highway as an alternative to the Federal Route 1, which would be later known as the North–South Expressway E1 and E2. The proposal to build the new highway was mooted {{as a result of the}} severe congestion along the Federal Route 1. Because of the large cost of the project, the highway was planned to be privatised and tolled, but none of the constructors being invited by the government were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job due to economic uncertainties at that time and the plan could not be materialised. It was only after Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad became the Prime Minister that the North–South Expressway project was revived. The project was launched in 1981.|$|E

500|$|Introducing {{the ethical}} stage it is {{moreover}} unclear if Kierkegaard acknowledges an ethical stage without religion. Freedom seems to denote freedom <b>to</b> choose <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right and <b>to</b> denounce the wrong in a secular, almost Kantian style. However, remorse (angeren) {{seems to be}} a religious category specifically related to the Christian concept of deliverance. Moreover, Kierkegaard is constant in his point of view that each single individual can become conscious of a higher self than the externally visible human self and embrace the spiritual self in [...] "an eternal understanding".|$|R
500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that our daughters and other girls {{can look up}} to", all-the-while aware of the [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> opposite. Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much {{more in common with}} James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female best friend in addition to Ron.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man that is well liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc {{is one of the}} sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
500|$|Wheelwright {{probably}} {{felt that}} he could make peace with Massachusetts without undue difficulty. In September 1642, while still in Exeter, an application for reconciliation was made on his behalf, to which the Bay Colony replied that he would be given safe conduct to return to Boston and petition the court. While he {{does not appear to have}} acted in that regard, Massachusetts was interested in mending fences, and without solicitation they again invited him to the General Court to be held on 10 May 1643. This prompted him to communicate with some of the ministers there, and they were so pleased with his demeanor that they likely coached him on how to frame a letter to the General Court. He wrote this letter on 10 September, and it reached Boston on 4 October 1643. The court was heavily inclined to retract the order of banishment, and again he was offered safe conduct to present his case to the court. John Winthrop had even sent a personal letter to him, to which he responded. In this letter Wheelwright, who may have come across as being too submissive in his first letter, now rested his claim for acquittal on justice, rather than mercy. He was not willing to desert his principles, though he [...] "made a manly concession of his error, to bring about reconciliation and peace, as was eminently becoming his sacred calling". Upon receipt of Wheelwright's second letter, Winthrop recommended that he appear in court in person, but this he was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> matter then rested until 29 May 1644 when the legislature acted without Wheelwright's physical presence, and made the following pronouncement: ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E

[...] Jayewardene pushed the party to accommodate nationalism and endorse the Sinhala Only Act, which was bitterly opposed by the island's minorities. [...] Throughout the 1960s Jayewardene clashed over this issue with party leader Dudley Senanayake. Jayewardene saw how skilfully the SLFP had played the ethnic card, and felt the UNP should be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same, even if it meant losing the support of ethnic minorities.|$|E

25|$|The Latin Kingdom {{continued}} to exist, theoretically, {{on the island}} of Cyprus. There the Latin kings schemed and planned to recapture the mainland, but in vain. Money, men, and <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> task were all lacking. One last effort was made by King Peter I in 1365, when he successfully landed in Egypt and sacked Alexandria. Once the city was pillaged, however, the Crusaders returned as speedily as possible to Cyprus to divide their loot. As a crusade, the episode was futile, and this and further coastal raids over the following decades led in 1410–11 to a destructive counter-raid by the Mamelukes; in 1426 Cyprus was forced into Mameluke vassalship with a hefty yearly tribute.|$|R

2500|$|In 2014, Kaine {{argued that}} the U.S. {{military}} intervention against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), undertaken by President Obama, was unconstitutional without a new congressional authorization {{for the use of}} military force against ISIL. In November 2014, at the Halifax International Security Forum, Kaine, together with Senator John McCain, emphasized the necessity of such a congressional authorization, saying: [...] "You just can't have a war without Congress. You can't ask people to risk their lives, risk getting killed, seeing other folks getting killed or injured if Congress isn't <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job to put their thumbprint on this and say, this is a national mission and worth it." [...] After the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike in Syria, ordered by President Donald Trump, Kaine said: [...] "There is no legal justification for this. He should not have done this without coming to Congress." [...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E

Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
