These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E

25|$|Ethical {{vegetarian}} {{concerns have}} become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal, and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has {{to be satisfied with}} a mass-production system, regardless of the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed free-range rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat.

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his monistic philosophy, Schopenhauer was {{very concerned about the}} <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word [...] "will" [...] designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other. For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.|$|E

Broome's interest in creating an organisation to promote animal welfare and oppose cruelty was apparent in a letter of his that was published in The Kaleidoscope on 6 March 1821 that asked for information about the existence of an anti-cruelty organisation that may have been operating in Liverpool. Another piece of evidence concerns a notice that appeared in various newspapers and that was signed under the pseudonym [...] "Clerus": ...|$|E
2500|$|Ben Mepham, bioethicist {{and fellow}} of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?, concludes about the vegan {{philosophy}} that [...] "if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‘all things considered’, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‘to conclude that veganism is the ‘only ethical response’ {{is to take a}} big leap into a very muddy pond’." [...] He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.|$|E

2500|$|While it {{is neither}} {{required}} (required only on special holidays [...] according to some traditions, but not on Shabbat , when just bread and wine/grape juice is required) nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, {{not just because of}} a concern for the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. [...] One modern-day scholar who is in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals, as all humans and animals were originally commanded by God to only eat plants. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the [...] "Nazirite" [...] of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.|$|E

[...] He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. [...] Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. [...] When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” [...] Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. [...] He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill his mouth with sugar, honey, or maple syrup. [...] He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 in the UK, a {{parliamentary}} working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions {{and treatment of}} animals in UK circuses. All {{members of this group}} agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals. Gale told the BBC, [...] "It's undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate—the cages are too small, the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe {{the time has come for}} that practice to end." [...] The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University [...] "found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation." [...] However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of [...] "scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom." [...] According to that group's report, published in October 2007, [...] "there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments." ...|$|E
