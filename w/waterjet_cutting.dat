It features a 50 ft diameter ring of 30 stones around a horseshoe of five trilithons through which various sightings of sunrise and sunset can be made. About 160 tons of granite were used to construct the monument. The rock was cut by Missouri S&T's water jet cutter equipment, which used two <b>waterjets</b> <b>cutting</b> at a pressure of 15,000 pounds of force per square inch (103 MPa), slicing across the surface just like a conventional saw. The cutter moved at a speed of about 10 feet per minute (50 mm/s) and cut between one-quarter and one-half inch (6 and 13 mm) on each pass.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{publications}} on {{the modern}} Abrasive <b>Waterjets</b> (AWJ) <b>cutting</b> were published by Dr. Mohamed Hashish in the 1982 BHR proceedings showing, {{for the first}} time, that waterjets with relatively small amounts of abrasives are capable of cutting hard materials such as steel and concrete. The March 1984 issue of the Mechanical Engineering magazine showed more details and materials cut with AWJ such as titanium, aluminum, glass, and stone. Dr. Mohamed Hashish, was awarded a patent on forming AWJ in 1987. Dr. Hashish, who also coined the new term Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ), and his team continued to develop and improve the AWJ technology and its hardware for many applications which is now in over 50 industries worldwide. A most critical development was creating a durable mixing tube that could withstand {{the power of the}} high-pressure AWJ, and it was Boride Products (now Kennametal) development of their ROCTEC line of ceramic tungsten carbide composite tubes that significantly increased the operational life of the AWJ nozzle.

50|$|As <b>waterjet</b> <b>cutting</b> {{moved into}} {{traditional}} manufacturing shops, controlling the cutter reliably and accurately was essential. Early <b>waterjet</b> <b>cutting</b> systems adapted traditional {{systems such as}} mechanical pantographs and CNC systems based on John Parsons’ 1952 NC milling machine and running G-code. Challenges inherent to waterjet technology revealed the inadequacies of traditional G-Code, as accuracy depends on varying {{the speed of the}} nozzle as it approaches corners and details. Creating motion control systems to incorporate those variables became a major innovation for leading waterjet manufacturers in the early 1990s, with Dr John Olsen of OMAX Corporation developing systems to precisely position the waterjet nozzle while accurately specifying the speed at every point along the path, and also utilizing common PCs as a controller. The largest waterjet manufacturer, Flow International (a spinoff of Flow Industries), recognized the benefits of that system and licensed the OMAX software, with the result {{that the vast majority of}} <b>waterjet</b> <b>cutting</b> machines worldwide are simple to use, fast, and accurate.|$|E

40|$|A common {{defective}} {{phenomenon in}} abrasive <b>waterjet</b> (AWJ) <b>cutting</b> of layered {{materials such as}} polymer matrix composites is delamination which occurs only when the jet is unable {{to cut through the}} workpiece.

40|$|In waterjet/abrasive <b>waterjet</b> (WJ/AWJ) <b>cutting</b> systems, the {{components}} of both the ultra high-pressure (UHP) intensifier and the cutting head are subject to faults and performance degradation.

This paper investigates a new approach for the online health condition assessment of both UHP pump and cutting head components by using a single type of information source, i. e., the plunger displacement signal. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to study the effects of actual faulty components on the acquired signals during AWJ cutting.

The results of the parametric study showed that the best improvements are realised when the nozzle is oscillated at relatively small angles and high frequencies of oscillation.

40|$|Abstract. Abrasive <b>waterjet</b> (AWJ) <b>cutting</b> is an {{emerging}} technology which enables {{the shaping of}} practi-cally all engineering materials. However, AWJ cutting may cause roughness and waviness on the cut surface. This significantly affects the dimensional accuracy of the machined part {{and the quality of}} surface finish. In this study, the surface roughness of three granites is experimentally investigated for varying process parame-ters in abrasive waterjet. The philosophy of the Taguchi design is followed in the experimental study. Effects of the control (process) factors on the surface roughness are presented in terms of the mean of means responses. Additionally, the data obtained are evaluated statistically using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine significant process parameters affecting the surface roughness. Furthermore, effects of the material properties on the surface roughness are assessed. It was statistically found that the water pressure and the abrasive flow rate are the most significant factors influencing the surface roughness of granites. Additionally, a consistent relationship between the material grain size and surface roughness of the granites was observed...|$|R

40|$|Abrasive <b>waterjet</b> (AWJ) <b>cutting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recently}} developed nontraditional manufacturing technologies. It has been increasingly used in industry owing to its various distinct advantages over the other cutting technologies. However, many aspects of this technology require to be fully understood in order to increase its capability and cutting performance as well as to optimize the cutting process. This thesis contains an extensive literature review on the investigations of the various aspects in AWJ machining. It shows that while considerable work has been carried out, very little reported research has been found on the AWJ contouring process although it is a common AWJ cutting application. Because of the very nature of the AWJ cutting process, the changing nozzle traverse direction involved in AWJ contouring results in kerf geometrical or shape errors. A thorough understanding of the AWJ contouring process is essential for the reduction or elimination of these shape errors. It also shows that a lack of understanding of the AWJ hydrodynamic characteristics has limited the development of cutting performance models that are required for process control and optimization.
