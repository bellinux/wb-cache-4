25|$|The MacAdam Shield-Shovel {{currently}} {{stands in}} Canadian First World War historiography as an invention which was poorly conceived given that its intended purpose was never fully realized. One historian {{is of the}} opinion that the MacAdam Shield Shovel must be recognized for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> it represents: a serious attempt to improve the well-being of Canadian troops. Others feel the device is simply indicative of Sir Sam Hughes' greed and arrogance who often put his own well-being ahead that of his troops. It is also an illustration of the economic nationalism whereby locally developed technologies were ardently believed by their proponents inherently superior because they were products of the country.|$|E

A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> like. He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

He has shown this in his project developments, such as pushing back the release of Dead or Alive 4 just to polish the game based on feedback of top Japanese Dead or Alive players recruited to test it out. For Ninja Gaiden, he wanted to leave {{the best and the}} ultimate action game on the Xbox before moving on to the Xbox 360, thus he reworked the game and integrated the additional downloadable content to produce Ninja Gaiden Black. With Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, he chose to patch an easy-cash exploit rather than leaving it alone and ruminating over the consequences.|$|E

25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> is right. In this legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E

These moments play into Lex's psyche. Season three's [...] "Memoria" [...] finally explained the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Lex's infant brother, Julian. Gough explains that they had known the story of Julian Luthor back in season one, when the character was first mentioned in [...] "Stray", but they wanted to find the right time to explain the situation. The creative team wanted the audience to think that Lex was responsible for Julian's death as an infant, before finally revealing that Lex was merely covering for his mother.|$|E

[...] He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film [...] "spellbinding." [...] Ebert considered Renner [...] "a leading contender for Academy Awards," [...] writing, [...] "His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels.</b> He is not a hero in a conventional sense." [...] He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York.|$|E

Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he makes about Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader what Mr. H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than to explain to them <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise."

500|$|Uematsu's {{approach}} to composing the game's music was {{to treat it}} like a film soundtrack and compose songs that reflected {{the mood of the}} scenes rather than trying to make strong melodies to [...] "define the game", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be [...] "sad but beautiful", rather than more overtly emotional, creating <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> is a more understated feeling. Uematsu has additionally said that the soundtrack has a feel of [...] "realism", which also prevented him from using [...] "exorbitant, crazy music". The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic to the game and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu [...] "a sense {{that it was going to}} be a really good project". He later stated in the liner notes for the soundtrack album that the music for Final Fantasy VII was his [...] "greatest harvest" [...] to date.|$|E

Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>feels.</b> I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, or we could combine those two things.

He considers himself a pop-rock artist, {{although he has}} described his musical style as [...] "always more rock" [...] than he has been credited.

His passions, which often border on obsessions, include sports (particularly the Boston Red Sox and the New Zealand All Blacks), video games, books, and guitarist Leo Kottke.
