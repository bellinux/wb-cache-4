25|$|We clam {{up and get}} tense. But I {{think the}} {{national}} show will improve {{in the next few}} weeks. We want to include the best segments of IMT in the national show. IMT is a lot more spontaneous than the national show – we've run up to an hour overtime. We like to get the audience to participate and if we can find someone interesting in the studio audience <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> away our scripts and just adlib.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the {{negative binomial distribution}} is a discrete probability distribution {{of the number of}} successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted r) occurs. For example, if we define a 1 as failure, all non-1s as successes, and <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> a dice repeatedly until the third time 1 appears (r = three failures), then the probability distribution of the number of non-1s that had appeared will be a negative binomial.|$|E

500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're not watching [...] wouldn't you rather <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. <b>We</b> <b>throw</b> a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E

We were getting irritated. <b>We</b> <b>threw</b> him hard, and drew his hind legs up to his head till he grunted. When he was permitted to rise, he looked meek and small and tired and we were both deeply remorseful. We rearranged the pack--it was some encouragement to know he had not bucked it entirely off--and by blindfolding him we got him started on the trail behind the train.|$|R
500|$|... "In Flanders Fields" [...] is {{very popular}} in Canada, where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and {{may be the most}} well known {{literary}} piece among English Canadians. It has an official French adaptation, entitled , written by Jean Pariseau and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies. With an excerpted appearance on the ten-dollar bill from 2001 to 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy-themed quarters on several occasions. A version minted in 2004 featured a red poppy in the centre and is considered the first multi-coloured circulation coin in the world. To mark the poem's centennial in 2015, a coloured and uncoloured poppy quarter and a [...] "toonie" [...] ($2 coin) were issued as circulation coins, as well as other collector coins. Among its uses in popular culture, the line [...] "to you from failing hands <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> the torch, be yours to hold it high" [...] has served as a motto for the Montreal Canadiens hockey club since 1940.|$|E
500|$|By then, revolutionary {{examples}} also {{inspired the}} prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim {{their own political}} goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> in the balance all of what we have, our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness. And we never will stop, lest we vanquish or perish." ...|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Ben Davis, {{who also}} worked with Marvel on Guardians of the Galaxy, shot the film with a main unit of three Arri Alexa cameras. Davis said, [...] "Although the Alexa was Marvel's {{preferred}} camera, we weren't locked into that choice from the start. What wasn't negotiable {{was the fact that}} we were shooting digital: that's how Marvel shoots all of its films." [...] Davis also used Blackmagic Design's Pocket Cinema Cameras to meet the needs of the second unit kit explaining, [...] "The second unit typically needs a fleet of smaller cameras that are less expensive and are rugged enough to handle the various trials by fire, as it were, that <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> at them." [...] About the camera system, Whedon stated that this film was shot very differently from the first one; using lots of long lenses, and that he aimed to shoot the film almost like a documentary. To create the scenes depicting how Quicksilver views the world, scenes were shot with an ultra-high-speed camera and later combined with shots of Taylor-Johnson moving through the same scene at normal speed.|$|E

500|$|Football hooliganism {{reached its}} height in the 1970s and 80s. West Ham's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm {{were at the}} {{forefront}} of the trouble, not just against each other, but against the police and firms associated with other football teams. In 1972, the two clubs played each other in a testimonial match for Millwall defender Harry Cripps, who began his career at West Ham. The game was marred by intense fighting between the two club's hooligan firms, both inside and outside the ground. Four years later, a Millwall supporter, Ian Pratt, died at New Cross railway station after falling out of a train during a fight with some West Ham fans. After the incident West Ham hooligans constructed the chant, [...] "West Ham boys, we've got brains, <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> Millwall under trains." [...] Millwall fans waited patiently for two years for revenge, until West Ham were relegated to the Second Division. Prior to their next meeting with the Hammers on 7 October 1978, leaflets were distributed at Millwall's home matches bearing the words: [...] "A West Ham fan must die to avenge him." [...] The police responded with an unprecedented show of force for the game at Upton Park, which West Ham won 3–0. Some 500 officers controlled the crowd, carrying out extensive searches and strict segregation.|$|E
2500|$|The first memorial, remembering twenty-three chaplains {{who died}} during WWI, was {{dedicated}} on May 5, 1926.

2500|$|... {{carcasses}} of dead {{or dying}} cultures {{on the human}} landscape, that we have learned to dismiss this pollution of the human environment as inevitable, and even sensible, since it is wrongly assumed that the weak and unfit among musics and cultures are eliminated in this way… Not only is such a doctrine anti-human; it is very bad science. It is false Darwinism applied to culture – especially to its expressive systems, such as music language, and art. Scientific study of cultures, notably of their languages and their musics, shows that all are equally expressive and equally communicative, {{even though they may}} symbolize technologies of different levels… With the disappearance of each of these systems, the human species not only loses a way of viewing, thinking, and feeling but also a way of adjusting to some zone on the planet which fits it and makes it livable; not only that, but <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> away a system of interaction, of fantasy and symbolizing which, in the future, the human race may sorely need. The only way to halt this degradation of man's culture is to commit ourselves to the principles of political, social, and economic justice. (2003 : 286) ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{writing was}} {{grounded}} in improv, employing a [...] "yes to everything" [...] mentality. Much of the humor derived from extended improv {{games with the}} show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself. Many of the writers had improv training {{and at one point}} put together [...] "improv evenings" [...] at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on The Colbert Report were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had never looked at the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, [...] "at its purest expression, [...] a pebble that <b>we</b> <b>throw</b> into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples." ...|$|E
