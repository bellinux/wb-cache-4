500|$|Ekholm {{dismissed}} Sword of Aragon for its flawed {{copy protection}} and perceived lack of strategy. [...] Hiersekorn was more condemning; rating the game poorly for its graphics and sound, and confused by its presented lists {{of military and}} economic data, he called the game a [...] "cheap clone". [...] Regardless, such issues did not deter other reviewers from praising the game. [...] Pleased with {{the large amount of}} options to manage their cities and to order their armies in combat, they felt the game <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> offered many exciting moments; [...] Kritzen judged the system [...] "challenging and ultimately rewarding." [...] According to Retro Gamer magazine, [...] "Sword of Aragon is {{considered by many to be}} the best fantasy wargame ever." [...] Starkweather was equally pronounced in his opinion. [...] He called Sword of Aragon addictive and was willing to overlook issues with the game, finding pleasure in formulating strategies and tactics to overcome the enemy.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a force under Lieutenant Colonel J. T. Lang, {{consisting}} of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company, and detachments from the 7th Division Signals, 2/5th Field Ambulance and ANGAU, with 760 native carriers, set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September. Most of the force moved overland, reaching Kirkland's Crossing on 4 September, where it rendezvoused with B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. That night, a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft, sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang's force at Kirkland's Crossing. The small river-borne task force included 10 British 5-ton folding assault boats and Hoehn military folboats. which met up with 2/6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed crossing area with 8 of these folboats the day before. While neither river was deep, both were fast flowing, with shoals and hidden s. Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned. On the morning of 5 September, Lang's force was treated {{to the sight of}} the air force passing overhead. At this point, the Markham River formed three arms, separated by broad sand bars. Two were fordable but the other <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> flowing at [...] Using the folding boats and local timber, they constructed a pontoon bridge, allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment. That evening, they reached the Americans' position.|$|E

[...] The Wib 2 was powered by a [...] water-cooled V-12 Renault 12 M engine completely enclosed within a smooth cowling and drove a two blade propeller.

2500|$|A major liberal {{accomplishment}} {{includes the}} rise of liberal internationalism, which has been credited {{with the establishment of}} global organisations such as the League of Nations and, after World War II, the United Nations. The idea of exporting liberalism worldwide and constructing a harmonious and liberal internationalist order has dominated the thinking of liberals since the 18th century. [...] "Wherever liberalism has flourished domestically, it has been accompanied by visions of liberal internationalism," [...] one historian wrote. But resistance to liberal internationalism <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> bitter, with critics arguing that growing global interdependency would result in the loss of national sovereignty and that democracies represented a corrupt order incapable of either domestic or global governance.|$|E

[...] His piety <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> unfeigned; his walking humble yet dignified; his acquirements profound; in his mind the welfare of the Christian church was always the prominent consideration...He was one of those examples of steady virtue sent upon earth by Divine providence, as if to prove how near the great pattern of perfection it is permitted to approach." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{organised}} {{and sometimes}} violent civil unrest {{just prior to}} the famine, there was no organised rioting when the famine took hold.

[...] Lines of small children begging could stretch for miles outside of cities; at night, children could be heard [...] "crying bitterly and coughing terribly ... in the pouring monsoon rain ... stark naked, homeless, motherless, fatherless and friendless. Their sole possession was an empty tin". A schoolteacher in Mahisadal witnessed [...] "children picking and eating undigested grains out of a beggar's diarrheal discharge". Author Freda Bedi wrote that it was [...] "not just the problem of rice and the availability of rice. It was the problem of society in fragments." ...|$|E

2500|$|Studies of {{the whole}} region around Holden Crater have {{resulted}} in an understanding of a complex sequence of events that shaped the crater, which included two different lakes. [...] A large series of rivers called the Uzboi-Ladon-Morava (ULM) system drained water from the Argyre Basin, site of a large lake. [...] When an impact occurred and produced Holden Crater, the system was blocked by a crater rim almost a kilometer in height. Eventually water from drainage from the walls, with possibly a contribution from groundwater, collected {{to make the first}} lake. [...] This lake <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> long lasting. The lowest level of sedimentary rocks was deposited in this lake. Much water was inbounded in Uzboi Vallis because the rim of Holden Crater blocked the flow. Some of the backed up water came from Nirgal Vallis which had a discharge of 4800 cubic meters/second. [...] At a certain point the stored water broke through the rim of Holden and created a second, shorter lived lake 200–250m deep. [...] Water with a depth of at least 50m entered Holden at a rate that 5-10 times the discharge of the Mississippi River. [...] Terraces and the presence of large rocks (tens of meters across) support these high discharge rates.|$|E
2500|$|The Latécoère 440 was {{powered by}} a 650hp (485kW) Hispano-Suiza 12 Nbr upright V-12 engine. [...] Two of its {{radiators}} {{were placed on the}} underside of the lift struts, close to the fuselage, with a third on the port side of the fuselage itself. [...] This allowed a smoothly streamlined nose profile, though the cross-section of the fuselage here and elsewhere was essentially rectangular. [...] The aircraft commander, who was also navigator and bomb aimer was stationed with his bomb sights immediately behind the engine firewall. The pilot's cabin was under the wing, with his windshield at about mid chord; he had a Rhodoid glazed panel in the wing for a better view. [...] The cabin rear was glazed and extended into a deep cut-out in the wing trailing edge to improve upward visibility. [...] It merged into the gunner/radio operator's circular glazed cupola. The three crew positions were linked by a starboard side corridor which had an external door at each end. [...] The externally braced tailplane, placed on the top of the fuselage had a swept leading edge and carried split elevators. [...] The fin was nearly triangular but the rudder <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> rounded. [...] Neither control surface was balanced, but both had trim tabs.|$|E
2500|$|May Wallace {{shared her}} love of plants with her son {{while he was still}} a boy, {{teaching}} him to cross-breed pansies. When the African-American [...] "plant doctor" [...] and future agronomist George Washington Carver became a student and later an instructor at Iowa State University, the Wallaces took him into their home, as racial prejudice prevented Carver from living in the dormitories. As a boy, Wallace accompanied Carver on nature walks, identifying the botanical structures of wild flowers and prairie grasses. Carver left for Tuskegee when Wallace was eight, but his influence on Wallace <b>was</b> <b>deep</b> <b>and</b> lasting. By the age of ten, Wallace was experimenting with plant breeding in his own plot. He also developed a keen interest in math and statistics. At fifteen, he conducted experiments to demonstrate that the then-conventional method of judging the quality of corn strains solely by such esthetic qualities as the beauty and symmetry of the ears was deeply flawed, failing {{to take into account the}} vigor and productivity of the whole plant as measured quantitatively. Wallace's experiments proved that there was no relationship between yield and appearance. Where plant hybridity had traditionally been viewed negatively as [...] "mongrelization" [...] signaling decline, Wallace's work introduced the concept of hybrid vigor.|$|E
