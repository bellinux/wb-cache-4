5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an outsider.|$|E
5|$|SPFC hired Andjar Asmara, {{a former}} {{journalist}} and stagewriter {{who had been}} active with The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct Djaoeh Dimata; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and-white film.|$|E

5|$|The final polls {{from before}} the {{announcement}} of candidates gave Labour a four-point lead over the Conservative Party. From early in the campaign, the contest was presumed to be between the Labour and Conservative candidates, with both expected to comfortably reach {{the second round of}} voting. While Goldsmith – who was the last of the main candidates to be announced, on 3 October 2015 – was widely anticipated to be the Conservative candidate, Khan's selection <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a surprise.|$|E
5|$|Begley {{obtained}} approvals {{to carry}} out excavations at the site {{in collaboration with the}} University of Pennsylvania and the University of Madras; she and K.V. Raman were the directors of operation from 1989 to 1992. Steven Sidebothom of the University of Delaware, who had back ground knowledge of Roman Egypt, {{was in charge of the}} trenching at the site. Further excavations were done during six working seasons from 1989 to 1992, which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by Wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded on poor sandy foundations. The wood work was also noted to be of poor quality and the houses had no waterproofing. The excavations also lead to a view that Arikamedu's Roman trading link <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an inference. The excavations have now established that the trading with Rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by Wheeler; that trading continued from the second century BCE to the seventh or eighth century CE.|$|E

5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she {{found it easier to}} compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes {{in the same vein}} as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 {{season began}} well for Zolak, whose {{contract}} was extended through 1998. However, {{to remain with}} the Patriots, Zolak took a $250,000 pay cut to work around the salary cap. While he appeared set to keep his backup job heading into training camp, he faced tough competition from Jay Barker. While Zolak welcomed the challenge, his status as the backup quarterback began to seem uncertain a few weeks into training camp. By the end of training camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback job was safe. He took the role of emergency quarterback throughout the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking nearly all the snaps and Tom Tupa serving as the backup upon his signing. Zolak played in three games, completing one pass for five yards. He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but did not play in Super Bowl XXXI. Parcells ordered Zolak to lose weight, which Zolak did {{throughout much of the}} season. The 1997 season <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the same for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, though the Patriots did have a new coach in Pete Carroll. As training camp ended, Zolak gained significantly more playing time during drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells. As the regular season came and went, however, he had minimal playing time. Zolak saw action in four games, completing six of nine passes for 67yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.|$|E

5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on his own. In 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing, which he considered the artistic process, while the inking <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a craft.|$|E
5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in the towel. The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E
