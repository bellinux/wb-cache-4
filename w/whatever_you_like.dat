He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> and do not worry about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained.

500|$|The song {{starts with}} Gaga saying, [...] "I don't speak German, but I can if you like", then {{immediately}} launches into a spoken verse in faux-German. She then {{moves to the}} hook of the song, [...] "I’ll take you out tonight, say <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> scheiße be mine". Following the hook is a pre-chorus backed by syncopated synths, with influences of techno music. The chorus of the song, in which Gaga includes the word [...] "Scheiße", is backed by [...] "dueling screechy" [...] synths. It is broken up by Gaga repeatedly singing in-between lines [...] "oh oh oh oh oh" [...] in an electronically altered voice. The next verses, containing lyrics of Gaga being a strong woman, are all backed by [...] "growling, guttural" [...] synths, and are mixed with German and English. According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "Scheiße" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. It is composed on the key of C minor, with Gaga's voice spanning from F3 to C5. The song follows in the sequence of Cm–Cm/Cm–Eb/Gm as its chord progression.|$|E

2500|$|Western RPGs {{have also}} {{received}} criticism in recent years. They remain less popular in Japan, where, until recently, Western games in general {{had a negative}} reputation. In Japan, where {{the vast majority of}} early console role-playing video games originate, Western RPGs remain largely unknown. [...] The developer Motomu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs, stating that they [...] "dump you in a big open world, and let you do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> [...] difficult to tell a compelling story." [...] Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Western RPGs as [...] "a sort of different style, born from first person shooters." [...] In recent years, some have also criticized Western RPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action Christian Nutt of GameSpy states that, in contrast to Japanese RPGs, Western RPGs' greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has {{come at the expense of}} plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems. He also states that Western RPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself. Tom Battey of Edge Magazine noted that the problems often cited against Japanese RPGs (mentioned above) also often apply to many Western RPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for [...] "lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice." [...] Western RPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in [...] "narrative strength" [...] or [...] "mechanical intricacy" [...] due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.|$|E
