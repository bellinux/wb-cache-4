After spending the month of September 2011 with the Major League club, the team outrighted catcher J. C.

500|$|In 2004, he {{starred in}} {{an unusually high}} number of films. He first {{appeared}} opposite Polly Shannon in Direct Action under Sidney J.

Next he appeared in Ed Bye's Fat Slags, a film adaption of a comic strip The Fat Slags {{which appeared in the}} [...] "alternative" [...] British comic Viz. His role {{was little more than a}} cameo role alongside Geri Halliwell, Naomi Campbell and Angus Deayton. Reviews of the film were so poor that it remains on the IMDb's Bottom 100 as one of the worst movies ever made. He next appeared in Christopher Kulikowski's science fiction picture Retrograde alongside Gary Daniels and Joe Sagal. It tells the story of [...] "a group of genetically unique people who travel back in time to prevent the discovery of meteors containing deadly bacteria." [...] Shot in Italy, the film received the support of the Film Fund of Luxembourg. Finally he made his directorial debut, replacing Sidney J. Furie who got ill during pre-production, [...] with The Defender, in which he also starred alongside Shakara Ledard and Jerry Springer, who played the President of the United States. Lundgren plays Lance Rockford, the bodyguard of the head of the National Security Agency, Roberta Jones (Caroline Lee-Johnson), in a war on terror.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{highlighted}} Hemmings's {{association with}} the school. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings [...] "accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea and would fit the role. Nicholas Tucker (New Statesman) too noted the book as [...] "very one-sided, verging on the uncritical" [...] despite its readability and signs of thorough research. He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the [...] "sensationalized" [...] press and [...] "rosy" [...] recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of [...] "Old Boys' clubs elsewhere". He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from [...] "conventional educational wisdom" [...] and [...] "horrified hearsay", which had turned the school into [...] "a type of scholastic folk myth" [...] to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense {{by the time of}} publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American free school movement. Cowie wrote that Neill seemed to be enjoying greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was [...] "losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school. Nordberg (Best Sellers) said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and [...] "open education", [...] "he is basically an enthusiast" [...] who wrote a [...] "sympathetic portrayal". Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as [...] "the child of an overly strict and demanding father <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of his life in}} a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms." [...] Altogether, Nordberg wrote, Fifty Years succeeds in its [...] "systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea" [...] but fails to provide [...] "a balanced, profound look" [...] at its counterpart: [...] "need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world".|$|E

[...] That twelve men may [...] "easily" [...] clear 300 acres in four or five months; and that, for 600 dollars, a thousand acres may be cleared, and houses built on them. He recommends the Susquehanna, from its excessive beauty and its security from hostile Indians.

6000|$|There {{never was}} a soldier, purely brought up as such--and it is of such only I speak, and not of rare and even then perilous exceptions,--men educated in {{philosophy}} like Epaminondas, or in homely household virtues and citizenship like Washington--but there {{never was a}} soldier such as I speak of, who did more for the world than was compatible with his confined and arbitrary breeding. I do not speak, of course, with reference to the unprofessional part of his character. Circumstances, especially the participation of dangers and vicissitude, often conspire with naturally good qualities to render soldiers the most amiable of men; and nothing is more delightful to contemplate than an old military veteran, whose tenderness of heart has survived the shocks of the rough work it has been tried in, till twenty miserable sights of war and horror start up to the imagination as a set-off against its attractiveness. But, publicly speaking, the more a soldier succeeds, the more he looks upon soldiership as something superior to all other kinds of ascendancy, and qualified to dispense with them. He always ends in considering the flower of the art of government as consisting in issuing [...] "orders," [...] and that of popular duty as comprised in [...] "obedience." [...] Cities with him are barracks, and the nation a conquered country. He is at best but a pioneer of civilization. When he undertakes to be the civilizer himself, he makes mistakes that betray him to others, even supposing him self-deceived. Napoleon, though he was the accidental instrument of a popular re-action, was one of the educated tools of the system that provoked it,--an officer brought up at a Royal Military College; and in spite of his boasted legislation and his real genius, such he ever remained. He did as much for his own aggrandizement as he could, and no more for the world than he thought compatible with it. The same military genius which made him as great as he was, stopped him short of a greater greatness; because, quick and imposing as he was in acting the part of a civil ruler, he was in reality a soldier and nothing else, and by the excess of the soldier's propensity (aggrandizement by force), he over-toppled himself, and fell to pieces. Soldiership appears to have narrowed or hardened the public spirit of every man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> chief part of his life in it, who has died at an age which gives final proofs of its tendency, and whose history is thoroughly known. We all know what Cromwell did to an honest parliament. Marlborough ended in being a miser and the tool of his wife. Even good-natured, heroic Nelson condescended to become an executioner at Naples. Frederick did much for Prussia, as a power; but what became of her as a people, or power either, before the popular power of France? Even Washington seemed not to comprehend those who thought that negro-slaves ought to be freed.|$|E
