5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not cry when their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} {{segments}} were also parodies of popular culture. [...] "Dial D for Diddily" [...] featured various {{references to the}} television series, Dexter, the titular character whom Ned Flanders is supposed to represent when he goes on a killing spree. The music in the segment is the original music from the main title theme of Dexter by Rolfe Kent, although the title references Dial M for Murder. Two of the targets, Patty and Selma Bouvier, {{were killed in a}} similar fashion to the style of Wile E. Coyote. [...] "In the Na'vi" [...] was a parody of the 2009 film Avatar.

[...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, {{and their}} colleagues {{conducted}} another study {{on the effects of}} Blue's Clues, this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted more with other children's TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from Blue's Clues could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, [...] "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend {{to pay more attention to}} novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like Blue's Clues help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the public view archaeology as being something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a [...] "romantic adventurist occupation".

The audience may not take away scientific methods from popular cinema but they do form a notion of [...] "who archaeologists are, <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted".

2500|$|It is {{possible}} that the document originated within a school of early Christians, possibly proto-Gnostics.

The name of Thomas was also attached to the Book of Thomas the Contender, which was also in Nag Hammadi Codex II, and the Acts of Thomas. While the Gospel of Thomas does not directly point to Jesus' divinity, it also does not directly contradict it, and therefore neither supports nor contradicts gnostic beliefs. When asked his identity in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus usually deflects, ambiguously asking the disciples <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not see what is right in front of them, similar to some passages in the canonical gospels like John 12:16 and Luke 18:34.|$|E

2500|$|Forward and {{backward}} polarized radiation can be omitted in the asymptotic states of a {{quantum field theory}} (see Ward–Takahashi identity). [...] For this reason, and because their appearance in spin sums {{can be seen as}} a mere mathematical device in QED (much like the electromagnetic four-potential in classical electrodynamics), they are often spoken of as [...] "unphysical". [...] But unlike the constraint-based gauge fixing procedures above, the Rξ gauge generalizes well to non-abelian gauge groups such as the SU(3) of QCD. [...] The couplings between physical and unphysical perturbation axes do not entirely disappear under the corresponding change of variables; to obtain correct results, one must account for the non-trivial Jacobian of the embedding of gauge freedom axes within the space of detailed configurations. [...] This leads to the explicit appearance of forward {{and backward}} polarized gauge bosons in Feynman diagrams, along with Faddeev–Popov ghosts, which are even more [...] "unphysical" [...] in that they violate the spin-statistics theorem. [...] The relationship between these entities, and the reasons <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not appear as particles in the quantum mechanical sense, becomes more evident in the BRST formalism of quantization.|$|E
2500|$|Going {{across the}} {{lanthanides}} in the periodic table, the 4f orbitals are usually being filled. The {{effect of the}} 4f orbitals on the chemistry of the lanthanides is profound and is the factor that distinguishes them from the transition metals. There are seven 4f orbitals, {{and there are two}} different ways in which they are depicted: as a [...] "cubic set" [...] or as a general set. The cubic set is f'z3, [...] f'xz2, f'yz2, [...] f'xyz, f'z(x2−y2), [...] f'x(x2−3y2) and f'y(3x2−y2). The 4f orbitals penetrate the [...] core and are isolated, and thus they do not participate in bonding. This explains why crystal field effects are small and <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not form π bonds. As there are seven 4f orbitals, the number of unpaired electrons can be as high as 7, which gives rise to the large magnetic moments observed for lanthanide compounds. Measuring the magnetic moment can be used to investigate the 4f electron configuration, and this is a useful tool in providing an insight into the chemical bonding. The lanthanide contraction, i.e. the reduction in size of the Ln3+ ion from La3+ (103 pm) to Lu3+ (86.1 pm), is often explained by the poor shielding of the 5s and 5p electrons by the 4f electrons.|$|E
2500|$|The Rasch {{model is}} often {{considered}} to be the 1PL IRT model. [...] However, proponents of Rasch modeling prefer to view it as a completely different approach to conceptualizing the relationship between data and theory. [...] Like other statistical modeling approaches, IRT emphasizes the primacy of the fit of a model to observed data, while the Rasch model emphasizes the primacy of the requirements for fundamental measurement, with adequate data-model fit being an important but secondary requirement to be met before a test or research instrument can be claimed to measure a trait. [...] Operationally, this means that the IRT approaches include additional model parameters to reflect the patterns observed in the data (e.g., allowing items to vary in their correlation with the latent trait), whereas in the Rasch approach, claims regarding the presence of a latent trait can only be considered valid when both (a) the data fit the Rasch model, and (b) test items and examinees conform to the model. Therefore, under Rasch models, misfitting responses require diagnosis of the reason for the misfit, and may be excluded from the data set if one can explain substantively <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not address the latent trait. Thus, the Rasch approach can be seen to be a confirmatory approach, as opposed to exploratory approaches that attempt to model the observed data. [...] As in any confirmatory analysis, care must be taken to avoid confirmation bias.|$|E

2500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for this decline; {{a combination of factors}} is most likely. When asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. According {{to a study by the}} Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965. Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races. Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in Democracy and Technology that technological developments in society such as [...] "automobilization," [...] suburban living, and [...] "an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices" [...] have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.|$|E
