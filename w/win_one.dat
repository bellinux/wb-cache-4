5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak {{character}} with very strong special attacks.

This means that {{a total of six}} matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled {{at the same time to}} preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group.

As with most league competitions, three points are awarded for a <b>win,</b> <b>one</b> for a draw and zero for a loss. An {{additional}} point, however, is awarded for each goal scored. The {{system is designed}} to reward teams that adopt a more attacking style of play. Each entrant plays two matches, with the winner being the club that finishes {{at the top of}} the table. The original competition was held at De Meer, Ajax's home between 1934 and 1996. The Amsterdam Arena has played host to the event since its return.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{regional}} theater service organization Theatre Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area is the third largest center of activity for theater companies and actors in the United States, after the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas, with 400 companies spread throughout the region. The organization was founded in 1976 by the Magic Theatre and American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley. The latter two, along with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, have since gone on to <b>win</b> <b>one</b> Regional Theatre Tony Award each. Several famous actors have arisen from the Bay Area's theatre community, including Daveed Diggs from Hamilton and Darren Criss from Hedwig, A Very Potter Musical, and Glee.

5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old Court – New Court controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the court of last resort in the state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to <b>win</b> <b>one</b> of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, a bastion of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club needed to win {{to stay in touch}} with the top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored in the first half meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to <b>win</b> <b>one</b> more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5000|$|A {{player that}} bids zero {{and does not}} make it, loses 50 points if he <b>wins</b> <b>one</b> trick. If he <b>wins</b> more than <b>one</b> trick, for each {{additional}} trick he won, he receives 10 points. So a player who bids zero and <b>wins</b> <b>one</b> will get -50 points, and if he wins 2, he will get -40 points. Therefore, having bid zero and <b>winning</b> <b>one</b> trick, that player will want to win as many more additional tricks as he can.|$|R
