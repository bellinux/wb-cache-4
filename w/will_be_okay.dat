2500|$|Uriel is a {{character}} in The Dresden Files book series by Jim Butcher. In Small Favor, Uriel is a subtle but powerful player in the war with the Black Council and the Fallen/Denarians. Called the [...] "Watchman", he only reveals himself to the book's protagonist, Harry Dresden, as a janitor named [...] "Jake". In the novel, Harry receives the power of soulfire and believes that it came from Uriel. He is {{also referred to as}} Heaven's [...] "spook". [...] Uriel also appears at the end of Jim Butcher's novella The Warrior, which was released {{as a part of the}} anthology, Mean Streets. Uriel appears again in Changes, when Harry Dresden asks him for help, after being paralyzed from the waist down. Uriel tells him that he cannot help him, and that he is limited to what he has already done. He also tells Harry that Maggie is indeed his daughter, something that he hadn't been entirely sure of. In Ghost Story, Uriel uses his influence to offer Harry the opportunity to come back to Earth as a spirit to find out the identity of his killer. [...] This is not revealed until close to the end of the book, when Uriel also shows Harry that his friends and family <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>okay</b> in his absence. [...] He also shows how Harry was unduly influenced to take up the mantle of the Winter Knight and redresses this imbalance by telling him that Mab, the Winter Queen cannot change who he is. At another point in the book, Uriel becomes enraged when Harry nicknames him [...] "Uri" [...] (omitting [...] "el" [...] (God) from the phrase making up Uriel's name). Unlike his appearances in Small Favor and The Warrior, Uriel's form in Changes and Ghost Story is that of a young man with blond hair, rather than an old janitor. During his appearance in Skin Game, his form is that of an olive skinned young man with dark hair. He is not bound by linear time, and is responsible for protecting Free Will. [...] The author has described the character as a VP of Creation.|$|E

25|$|Clenora Hudson-Weems's Africana womanism {{arose from}} a {{nationalist}} Africana studies concept. In Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves, Hudson-Weems explores {{the limitations of}} feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is {{set up in a}} way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism <b>will</b> never <b>be</b> <b>okay</b> for black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice. She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a White man and a White woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black women battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man. She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the black experience. Unlike womanism, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana Womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.|$|R
