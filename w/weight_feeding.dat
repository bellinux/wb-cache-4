Biological and ecological characteristics such as size (length and wet <b>weight),</b> <b>feeding</b> habit, habitat, and stable isotope (delta N- 15) were examined to explain MeHg bioaccumulation in marine fish and their geographical distribution. MeHg levels in the muscle tissues of the 628 individuals ranged from 0. 010 to 1. 811 mu g/g dry wt. Log(10) MeHg concentration was significantly related to their length and wet <b>weight.</b> <b>Feeding</b> habit and habitat were the primary factors influencing MeHg bioaccumulation. Demersal fish {{were more likely to be}} contaminated with MeHg than the epipelagic and mesopelagic varieties. Linear relationships were obtained between Log(10) (MeHg) and delta N- 15 only for one location, indicating that biomagnification was site-specific.

Here, we demonstrate that perilipin (PLIN) 5 is required to couple intramyocellular triacylglycerol lipolysis with the metabolic demand for fatty acids. PLIN 5 ablation depleted triacylglycerol stores but increased sphingolipids including ceramide, hydroxylceramides and sphingomyelin. We generated perilipin 5 (Plin 5) -/- mice to determine the functional significance of PLIN 5 in metabolic control and insulin action. Loss of PLIN 5 {{had no effect on}} body <b>weight,</b> <b>feeding</b> or adiposity but increased whole-body carbohydrate oxidation. Plin 5 -/- mice developed skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which was associated with ceramide accumulation.

We conclude that PLIN 5 plays a critical role in coordinating skeletal muscle triacylglycerol metabolism, which impacts sphingolipid metabolism, and is requisite for the maintenance of skeletal muscle insulin action. © 2014 The Authors...|$|E

The silkworm pupa powder increased the bone with increasing calcium in serum. These results also showed its protective action through pro-motion of bone formation. The silkworm pupa powder has a definite antiosteoporotic effect; similar to estro-gen, it is especially effective for the prevention of bone fracture induced by estrogen deficiency. The silkworm pupa powder is a promising anti-osteoporotic agent that can prevent bone fractures in osteoporotic patients. The silkworm pupa powder does not show serious side effects because natural herbal medicine origin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aims: Although {{our current}} weight {{management}} guidelines suggest eating regularly, speculation about whether snacking assists with managing weight occurs widely among the media, weight loss clients and health professionals. We aim {{to examine whether}} there is adequate scientific evidence available to support the manipulation of eating frequently for improving body weight, diabetes and cardiovascular risk markers, and theories that link eating frequently with weight management. Methods: Relevant papers from nutrition and dietetics journals and other sources {{were used to assess}} the association between eating frequency and weight and health. Results: Longer-term evidence suggests eating frequency does not affect weight, glucose, insulin control, hunger or energy expenditure in intentional weight losers and maintainers. There is consistent short-term evidence of an inverse association between blood lipid levels and eating frequency during weight maintenance. Many of the common theories that suggest manipulating eating frequency for weight management are not supported by the literature. Sustaining a change to eating frequency also may be challenging over the longer term. Conclusions: Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating frequency greatly benefits weight and health. Health professionals may not need to manipulate eating frequency for weight management. Key words: body <b>weight,</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior, obesity.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of putrescine under anoxia was studied in seedlings of 6 Gramineae species showing tolerance {{to the stress}} in the following order: rice, barnyard grass> maize>rye, barley and wheat. The {{accumulation of}} putrescine in shoots and roots during 6 h of oxygen deprivation was different among the species and correlated with their tolerance to anaerobic conditions. In both tissues, rice and barnyard grass accumulated more than 0. 6 ^mol/g fresh weight. The lower increase in the putrescine titer was observed in wheat tissues with less than 0. 1 ^mol/g fresh <b>weight.</b> <b>Feeding</b> experiments with [l 4 C]arginine showed that rice tissues have a greater capacity than wheat tissues to synthesize putrescine under anoxia. The better tolerant species to anaerobic conditions showed high arginine decarboxylase activity in shoots and roots than the sensitive species. The presence of exogenous Put partially increased the survival of wheat roots after 7. 5 h of oxygen-deficit stress. The role of putrescine in determining differences in the tolerance to anox-ia in Gramineae seedlings is discussed. Key words: Anoxia — Arginine decarboxylase — Gramineae — Putrescine — Root — Shoot.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of pelleted diets prepared differing by levels of grinding preparation (2 or 4 mm) to evaluate pellet quality and diet preferences in adult breeders poultry species: guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), layer hen (Gallus domesticus) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) to improve {{our understanding of the}} diet physical structure influencing feed intake. All diets were of identical composition as well as same environment and management were provided for all treatments. The parameters evaluated in this 4 weeks feeding trial included: live body <b>weight,</b> <b>feed</b> intake, feed efficiency and pellet durability index. Body <b>weight</b> gain, <b>feed</b> intake and feed efficiency were influenced (p< 0. 05) by the dietary treatments in each poultry species. The present data suggest that pellet particle size is advantageous in terms of feed intake and efficiency in poultry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{experiment}} was a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement of four feeding programs {{with or without}} water soluble multivitamin + electrolytes supplementation for the first 3 days of age. Four feeding programs includes: feeding a starter diet immediately after hatch until 28 d of age, feeding a prestarter diet immediately after hatch until 3 d of age, fasting for 24 hours after hatch, or fasting for 12 hours with access to water containing 5 % sugar followed by 12 hours corn feeding after hatch. All chicks on the prestarter, fasting, and sugar corn feeding programs were fed the starter diet until 28 d of age {{after the end of}} the initial 3 d or 24 h treatment. This was followed by grower and finisher diets for the periods 29 to 42 d and 43 to 48 d, respectively. Feeding program had a significant (p 0. 05) differences were observed in overall feed intake and feed conversion ratio. Supplement had no significant effects on body <b>weight,</b> <b>feed</b> intake, and feed conversion ratio. No interactions were observed between feeding program and supplement for body <b>weight,</b> <b>feed</b> intake, and feed conversion ratio. No significant differences were observed for abdominal fat, and organs weight (except for liver) between feeding programs. Twenty four hours fasting significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced T concentration. multivitamin + electrolytes 3 supplement significantly (p< 0. 05) increased liver weight and T concentration. 3 Key words: Early feeding program, broiler performance, body <b>weight,</b> <b>feed</b> intak...|$|R
