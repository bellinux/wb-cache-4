500|$|When {{the third}} edition was {{published}} in 1845, Balzac {{was in love with}} his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's no doubt about it – it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.… The passion is sublime, and I now understand <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.|$|E

2500|$|While {{speaking}} {{at a conference in}} 2000, Watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos. His lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. [...] "That's <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Latin lovers," [...] he said, according to people who attended the lecture. [...] "You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Cytherea! <b>Why,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{grown to}} love--like--Mr. Manston, {{and how could}} you be {{anything}} to me--or care for me? Surely I acted naturally?' ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{turned and}} entered his house. [...] As he did, , the Wind, came up beside the twins. [...] "The tobacco is poisonous," [...] he whispered. [...] "The spittle of , the spiny {{caterpillar}} will protect you." [...] At once the twins saw a spiny caterpillar on the path, and {{took some of}} its spittle into their mouths. [...] Inside, , the Sun, brought forth a turquoise pipe from a high shelf on his eastern wall and lit it with the red sun disk. [...] He puffed on it himself, and then passed it to the twins, who each puffed on it themselves. [...] "What sweet tobacco," [...] said the twins. [...] Seeing this, [...] the Sun said, [...] "Truly you are my sons. Now tell me <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come." [...] "Father," [...] they said, [...] "we have come because , the Alien Monsters, are killing all our people. [...] the Big Giant devours our people. [...] , the Horned Monster, devours them. [...] , the Bird Monster, devours them, and so does , who kills with his eyes. [...] Give us weapons {{so that we may}} destroy [...] and the others." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} annual High School Hoops magazine, the players {{weighed in on}} the subject of the new rules {{regarding}} draft eligibility. Many of them felt that it was unfair. Kansas State freshman Bill Walker, said (as a junior in high school), [...] "I'm against it. I don't see <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous." [...] Jerryd Bayless said [...] "It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go pro at 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go pro at 18." [...] A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said [...] "It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain." [...] In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that [...] "…I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. Some guys who come in, like from this year's draft, it will help." [...] Brandan Wright said that [...] "It may hurt guys who need money, but it will help people grow and develop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, please," [...] {{the voice}} answered. [...] "I know <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been angry with me. I know <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{kept away from}} me, <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been so cruel! It was because I failed. Was it not, dear Mademoiselle Violet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Jeff," [...] she said, with {{pleasure}} in her tones. [...] "I am {{so glad to}} see <b>you.</b> I <b>have</b> been wondering <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not come before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{right to}} expect {{anything}} better of him, as you call it," [...] retorted his wife. [...] "It's perfectly natural." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Its a {{very common}} procedure," [...] Carroll rejoined. [...] "I've {{wondered}} <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> so strong an objection to it. Of course, I've heard your business reasons." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is worth}} doing. If you {{see it that way}} it is more worth doing than {{anything}} else. Please don't think," [...] she said, [...] "that I don't appreciate <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me all this, <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given me your reasons. I know it hasn't been easy. It's because you wish me to have faith in you for my own sake, not for yours. And I am grateful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied. [...] "It was distress, rather. You see, you weren't there, and I couldn't tell <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{gone away}} from me. A nasty dream--the first I've had, too, since--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I will," [...] Dane said quietly, {{though he}} was once more maladroit. [...] "I wished to ask <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> avoided me like {{contagion}} lately?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, sir, but <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> words," [...] said she; [...] "you must <b>have</b> words. <b>Why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> so {{many words}} with that Signora Neroni? <b>Why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> disgraced yourself, you a clergyman, too, by {{constantly}} consorting with such a woman as that--with a married woman--with one altogether unfit for a clergyman's society?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} to save him. His mother has let him die!

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Polly, slowly, [...] "I {{just try}} to {{look on the bright}} side of things; that helps one amazingly. <b>Why,</b> <b>you</b> <b>'ve</b> no idea how much {{goodness}} and sunshine you can get out of the most unpromising things, if you make the best of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> done it at all? <b>Why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> mixed {{your name}} up in {{anything}} so ridiculous? What {{was it you}} did say to the archbishop?" ...|$|R
