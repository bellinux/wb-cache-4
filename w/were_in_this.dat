5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally ordered all submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they <b>were</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales can {{be found}} in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current {{population}} sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned, and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> population in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
5|$|This {{case had}} a lamp and socket used by Hammer {{for the first}} {{electric}} sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – {{one at a time}} in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case.|$|E

They were expected to attack the rampart defending the bazaar. The left wing was commanded by Captain Major Mendonça himself. His force consisted of eight companies of regulars, 200 Canarese musket men and Lascarins under Francisco Antunes (Dissawe of Matara) and Francisco da Silva (Dissawe of Seven Korale). They were to attack the trenches and the battery mounted on high ground.|$|E

25|$|Brière de l'Isle was {{committed}} to expanding French control over the middle Niger River valley, but unlike many of his predecessors the French governments of the late 1870s were more willing to sanction (or accept) direct conquest of territory. Ironically the merchant houses based in Saint-Louis <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period still hesitant about direct control of the hinterlands, preferring to work through their own trade networks and the series of French military trading posts. In this way as well, Brière de l'Isle was representative of the next stage in French colonialism. See also: C. W. Newbury and A. S. Kanya-Forstner.

25|$|The {{separate}} celebrations then {{involved the}} building of many altars in one church and {{the reduction of the}} ritual to the simplest possible form. The deacon and subdeacon <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case dispensed with; the celebrant took their part as well as his own. One server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers, everything was said instead of being sung, the incense and kiss of peace were omitted. So we have the well-known rite of low Mass (missa privata). This then reacted on high Mass (missa solemnis), so that at high Mass too the celebrant himself recites everything, even though it be sung by the deacon, subdeacon, or choir.|$|E
25|$|This much we know: William (Gen. 2) Carpenter's {{admission}} as a Massachusetts Bay Colony freeman from Weymouth in 1640 required church membership. The {{minister at}} Weymouth was Rev. Samuel Newman, most of whose congregation accompanied him to Rehoboth, {{where he was}} also the minister. William (Gen. 2) Carpenter was one of Rehoboth's fifty-eight original proprietors and is buried in Old Rehoboth (Newman Church) Cemetery. (While records of the time provide no direct evidence as to the religious affiliation of William (Gen. 2) Carpenter of Rehoboth, he was certainly not a Baptist, even though other Carpenters in New England <b>were.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regard, he is sometimes confused with William Carpenter (Rhode Island) of Providence and others.|$|E

25|$|Most {{violations}} are technical violations, and {{the primary}} reason for technical violations is substance abuse. The supervised release revocation rate in 1990 was 67 percent. In 1992, 47 percent of supervised release cases were closed by violation, of which 72 percent were revoked for technical reasons not involving the commission of a new offense. By 1993, the rate had dropped to 42 percent, with about 69 percent of those revoked for technical reasons. The reason for the drop may have been that releasees who are {{in the early years of}} their term of supervised release are more likely to be revoked; when supervised release was first introduced, all of the releasees <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> high-risk category.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on 8 October, after {{receiving}} the sacraments of confession and communion, the Portuguese prepared themselves for the retreat. The remaining 368 Portuguese, with a few Lascarins, formed themselves into three equal columns. D. Gastão Coutinho led the first column as a vanguard. With the second column came Empress Dona Catarina, mounted on an elephant, and the Captain-General’s small son, Diogo Lopes de Sousa. Other transport elephants bearing munitions and the treasure of Jayavira Bandara <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> column as well. The rearguard was led by Pedro Lopes de Sousa himself. The Captain-General made a speech to boost the morale of his men, calling upon their loyalty and honor. Then, after worshiping the crucifix held by the Jesuit priest Father António Esquipano, they began their march towards the Balana fortalice.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand gathers {{information}} on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law {{for every person}} in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E
