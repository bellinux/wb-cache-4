5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E

Longer-range bombing and reconnaissance flights concentrated on German-occupied airfields and railway stations; the night bombing specialists of 100 Squadron attacked trains around Lille, Courtrai, Roulers and Comines. Two squadrons were reserved for close air support on the battlefield and low attacks on German airfields.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} lexical-semantic {{properties of}} verbs, adjectives and auxiliaries appearing in adnominal clauses {{in comparison with}} those in final-attributives（sentences ending in adnominal form）in colloquial Heian Japanese. It is revealed {{that there is a}} certain correlation between the lexical semantics and the syntax of adnominal-ending form. The specific findings are as follows:（１）In adnominal clauses verbs of motion/change, verbs of emotion/thought/perception and verbs of existence <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent,</b> in descending order, while in final-attributives verbs of emotion/thought/perception, verbs of motion/change, and verbs of existence <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent,</b> in descending order. （２）In adnominal clauses all adjectives types（emotional, attributive and intermediate）are found, while in final-attributives only emotional（often with negative connotation）adjectives are used. （３）No particular correlations are found between the frequency and the lexical meanings of auxiliaries in adnominal clauses. In final-attributives, emotion/thought auxiliaries, past/perfective auxiliaries, inference auxiliaries, negative auxiliaries, assertive auxiliaries <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent,</b> in descending order...|$|R

The infamous mass crimes, the {{destruction}} of villages and the murder of their inhabitants, occurred in phase 3 and mainly in phase 4, when after conclusion of the coordinated military advance with daily objectives to be reached under all circumstances more time was left therefor. This depopulation was always planned in advance. Only thereafter was the operation considered as concluded. In phase 4 there also commenced the more or less organized plundering of agricultural products of the affected area, the so-called collection.|$|E
50|$|These {{jurisdictional}} disputes <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> in {{the building}} trades, where {{a number of different}} unions might claim the right to have work assigned to their members. The craft unions in this industry organized their own department within the AFL in 1908, despite the reservations of Gompers and other leaders about creation of a separate body within the AFL that might function as a federation within a federation. While those fears were partly borne out in practice, as the Building Trades Department did acquire a great deal of practical power gained through resolving jurisdictional disputes between affiliates, the danger that it might {{serve as the basis for}} schism never materialized.|$|E

Away from intersections, collisions most often involved a motorist overtaking a cyclist, or opening a car-door in the path of a cyclist. In the central area of the city, the most frequent type of collision involved a motorist opening their car-door in the path of a cyclist. Almost 30% of the cyclists were cycling on the sidewalk immediately prior to their collisions.|$|E

50|$|There were {{cases of}} Carlist deputies {{acquiring}} their seat with no competition during the elections.

Joaquín Llorens recorded the most triumphant victory, conquering 99,51% of votes cast in 1907. None of the studies consulted offers any detailed and systematic personal profiling. The information available suggests that Carlist deputies were usually landowners, lawyers, academics and journalists, with rather few entrepreneurs, officials and military men. Most of them commenced the Cortes career in their 30s.|$|E

50|$|The common {{firecrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, often with its crest raised, {{and has a}} display which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern.

The breeding territory is about 0.5 ha, and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with the crest raised {{and a great deal}} of wing-fluttering, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great.
