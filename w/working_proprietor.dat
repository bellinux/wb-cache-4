40|$|M. Comm. Since the April 1994 {{elections}} {{the issue}} of economic empowerment and growth have had a high priority {{on the agenda of}} the Government of National Unity of South Africa. Small and medium enterprises (SME's) represent an important vehicle to address the challenges of job creation, economic growth and equity in our country. Throughout the world one finds that SME's are playing a critical role in absorbing labour, penetrating new markets and generally expanding economies in creative and innovative ways. Research indicates that there are more than 800 000 small and medium enterprises in South Africa, absorbing {{about a quarter of the}} approximately 15 million people which comprises the formal labour force. According to the White Paper on National Strategy for the Development and Promotion of Small Business in South Africa (1995 : 10), this does not include about 3, 5 million people who are involved in some or other type of survivalist enterprise activity force. While the importance of large industrial, mining and other enterprises for the growth of the economy cannot be denied, there is ample evidence that the labour absorptive capacity of the small business sector is high, with the average capital cost per job created in this sector, usually being lower than in big businesses. In addition the small business sector's role in technical and other innovations is vital for the many challenges facing the South African economy. Notwithstanding the importance of small enterprises in the South African economy, they are still faced with a wide range of constraints and problems that are common to small enterprises. There can be no doubt that compared to big businesses in South Africa and small businesses in other countries, these problems have not been sufficiently addressed. The constraints relate, amongst others, to the legal and regulatory environment confronting SME's, the access to markets, finance, the acquisition of skills and management expertise and in some cases, the tax burden. This study will be aimed at addressing the problems that small enterprises experience with the South African Tax System. The dissertation is based on various Acts as effective during April 1997. Various factors were identified in the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into certain aspects of the Tax Structure of South Africa, (Katz, November 1994 : 150) under the chairmanship of Prof. M. M. Katz. These factors include, amongst others, the following: Small and medium-sized enterprises have a greater dependence on the <b>working</b> <b>proprietor</b> as a source of funds, since they do not have access to public securities markets for {{the issue of}} equity or long term loan capital. The taxation of the income of the <b>working</b> <b>proprietor</b> therefore directly depletes their principal source of equity capital, requiring the entrepreneur to make greater use of short term debt finance. This in turn increases their risk exposure; Whereas savings which flow via financial institutions (for example, through pension and life insurance contributions) to the corporate sector enjoys tax relief, no equivalent relief is available to working proprietors who invest in their own businesses; There is considerable evidence that the compliance burden of taxation falls disproportionately on smaller enterprises, who do not have expertise in the completion of tax returns or in other aspects of tax compliance, and either make use of expensive professional assistance or rely on the proprietor's own efforts. The compliance burden is aggravated by frequent changes in the tax system, complicated structures and rules, and the lack of taxpayer education opportunities. The problem of the compliance burden on smaller enterprises has probably become more severe in recent years as a consequence of the introduction of Value Added Tax and the fact Jiat the present Standard Income Tax on Employees personal income tax requires more detailed personnel records than the former Final Deduction System which it replaced; The general bias in tax systems towards favouring capital investment and penalising employment through investment relief and social security contributions tends to favour large firms, which have easier access to sources of capital, and discriminates against smaller firms which tend to be more labour intensive...|$|E

40|$|This study utilises data {{derived from}} the {{responses}} of 871 manufacturing SMEs between 1995 / 96 and 1997 / 98. The firms were segmented according to McMahon's (2001) taxonomy of low, moderate and high growth SMEs and then divided into family and non-family businesses. The study then empirically compares seven characteristics of managerial development across the two groups. The findings indicate there are {{significant differences in the}} managerial development of family and non-family businesses. In general, family businesses have more <b>working</b> <b>proprietors,</b> partners or directors; major decision-makers with less tertiary qualifications and are slower to adopt some management practices as they grow. Similarities include the size of their management teams, the practices of comparing performance and budget forecasting, and the evolution process itself. From a methodological perspective the findings indicate that the context of firms sampled needs to be controlled if meaningful comparisons are to be made. ...|$|R

We use two different measures to identify the gender composition of the top layer based on direct survey data: the fraction of women among top managers, and the fraction of women among <b>working</b> <b>proprietors.</b> We document the following facts: a) There is a strong negative association between the fraction of women in the top layer of management and several establishment outcomes, among them business volume, investment, total wage bill per worker, total employment, and turnover; b) Establishments with a high fraction of women in the top layer of management are more likely to implement female-friendly policies, such as providing childcare facilities or promoting and mentoring female junior staff; c) The fraction of women in the top layer of management is also negatively associated with employment and wages, both male and female, full-time and part-time. However, all of these associations vanish when we include establishment fixed effects and establishment-specific time trends. This reveals a substantial sorting of female managers across establishments: small and less productive establishments that invest less, pay their employees lower wages, but are more female-friendly {{are more likely to be}} led by women...|$|R

40|$|Construction is a {{labour-intensive}} industry, {{which places}} heavy reliance upon {{the skills of}} its workforce. These skills need updating continually {{as many of the}} trades involved in the industry become increasingly specialized. During the 1980 s, there was a rapid rise in construction activity within the UK, followed by a sudden but short-lived boom accompanied by skill shortages. The construction industry is now experiencing a deeper and longer lasting recession than originally predicted, resulting in valuable employees in all sections of the industry being lost - a high proportion of whom will not return to the construction industry. The construction industry is predicted to grow in the period after the recession by an average of 3 % per annum until the year 2001. With this growth the industry is expected to experience considerable skill shortages in both traditional and new skill areas. Construction is in a period of rapid cultural change accompanied by the introduction of new technologies and new ways of organizing construction activities. Powerful national and multinational clients will continue to influence the choice of these technologies through their demands for faster construction times. The construction industry will continue to face increased competition in search of eligible recruits to train accordingly. Employment within the construction industry will continue to move away from large and medium sized firms to small firms and <b>working</b> <b>proprietors.</b> In the 1980 s, self-employment and the use of specialist labour-only sub-contractors increased as training levels declined. This trend will hamper the industry's ability to train people for future skill needs. This paper aims to assist interested parties in the construction industry understand and realize the importance of labour resource issues and the need for long-term planning of labour resource requirements, so allowing them to train and retrain people to address the predicted skill shortages...|$|R
40|$|Using panel {{data from}} three {{nationwide}} surveys in Zimbabwe, an error components model {{is estimated to}} explore the factors that drive the small-enterprise sector. Among labour-intensive industries in urban areas, entry of new enterprises appears {{to be driven by}} surplus labour. This is supported by low barriers to entry and the negative relationship between economic growth and entry rates. In contrast, entry in capital-intensive industries is unrelated to economic growth and it is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including capital, <b>working</b> capital, and <b>proprietor</b> experience. With the exception of labour-intensive industries in rural areas, entry in all other small-enterprise industries is positively correlated with agricultural income.

50|$|Ebenezer Ward {{was born}} the eldest son of the Rev. Joseph Ward, {{a member of an}} old English family, at Russalls, Mersey Island, Essex. He was educated at Dumpton Hall, a school {{established}} for the sons of Baptist ministers, near Ramsgate, Kent. It was intended that he joined the ministry but in 1849 he rebelled and decamped for London. He found work as a copy boy at a large printing office in Lincoln Inn Fields. It was during his short stay there that Ward acquired his appreciation of Shakespeare while checking proof sheets which they were printing for Routledge. He next worked for the Morning Post as a reader's boy at 15/ a week. He was promoted to reader, then reviser, and eventually a member of their reporting staff in the gallery of the House of Commons and became proficient in shorthand. He won the confidence of his employers, and at age eighteen he was <b>working</b> with the <b>proprietor's</b> son, Algernon Borthwick, with whom he maintained a long correspondence. Ward left the Morning Post in 1856 after inheriting some money, and returned to Essex for three years, living the life of a country squire.|$|R
