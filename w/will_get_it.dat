25|$|When {{a player}} makes a move {{such that the}} opponent's only {{remaining}} royal (king or prince) could be captured on the following move, the move is said to give check; the king or prince {{is said to be}} in check.

25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E
25|$|Back in the Enchanted Forest, the {{characters}} attempt {{to work together}} to restore their realm. Regina struggles {{to come to terms with}} the loss of Henry, removing her heart and producing a sleeping curse for herself; though Mary Margaret and Robin Hood persuade her to move forward. Hood and Regina strike a strong friendship, unaware that they are each other's true love. She later takes back her castle, finding Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader) inside, who reveals to Regina that she is her older half-sister as she is the daughter of Cora. She explains her back story of how Cora abandoned her, sending her to Oz, and how she seeks to take everything that she never had away from Regina. Neal and Belle travel to Rumplestiltskin's castle and are located to the Dark One's Vault by a candle-man named Lumiere. Neal unlocks the vault, resurrecting Rumplestiltskin but killing himself. Before he dies, Rumplestiltskin takes his body and merges it with his own. Hook departs the group to return to his pirate life, but struggles with the loss of the Jolly Roger. He is later informed by Ariel that the ship was stolen by fellow pirate Blackbeard (Charles Mesure). Following a duel, Hook seemingly kills Blackbeard and reclaims the Jolly Roger, while Ariel later discovers that her missing love Prince Eric had been kidnapped and taken to Hangman's Island. She later manages to find him and the two live happily together. In the Enchanted Forest, Zelena gets closer to Snow's unborn baby and informs her that she <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> Eager to find a way stop Zelena, Snow and David seek help from Glinda the Good Witch, who informs them that light magic can defeat Zelena. Understanding this to be a reference to Emma, David sacrifices his heart to Snow, who reluctantly crushes it to create a new curse. Zelena appears and adds a memory spell to the curse that removes everyone's memories of the past year in the Enchanted Forest. Shortly afterwards, Snow instructs Regina to take her heart, split it in half and give half to Snow and half to David, and David awakens before the curse is fully enacted. Unbeknownst to Zelena, who gives Rumplestiltskin a memory potion to keep his memories intact, Neal temporarily removes himself from his father's body and sends the potion to Hook so that he can bring Emma back to Storybrooke.|$|E
500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} met with similar reception. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.2 out of 5, lower than the Super NES version's score. IGN noted that the Game Boy Advance version [...] "gave {{both good and bad}} {{impressions}} about Kemco's abilities to port SNES to the handheld" [...] and that the multi-player mode <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> its [...] "dues". They gave specific criticism to the early build of Crazy Chase due to the stiff controls and delayed jump. They also criticized the animation for being less fluid than the Super NES version's. GamePros Fennec Fox called the Super NES game [...] "semi-obscure", while fellow GamePro writer DJ Dinobot criticized the Game Boy Advance's preview build for Crazy Chase for its controls were [...] "harder to steer than a 1976 Pinto with a flat tire".|$|E

500|$|Nick Pino of TechRadar, {{giving it}} four stars out of five, {{similarly}} {{felt that the}} Xbox One [...] " [...] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago," [...] citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that [...] "there's {{still a lot of}} potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> to that point, though, is still a mystery." [...] However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.|$|E

Although similarly named, it is not the same as condyloma latum, which is a complication of secondary syphilis.|$|E

2500|$|Still, some {{proponents of}} the BCS {{recognize}} the inconsistency that the system offers. An article taken from BCSfootball.org titled [...] "Playoff Smayoff!

[...] By 1872, territorial officials were considering harvesting the rich timber resources of the Black Hills, to be floated down the Cheyenne River to the Missouri, where new plains settlements needed lumber. The geographic uplift area suggested the potential for mineral resources.
