6000|$|The {{mountains}} {{we crossed}} last year are {{the scene of}} warfare, and there [...] is nothing but carnage and cutting of throats. In my other letter I [...] mentioned that Vely <b>had</b> given me <b>a</b> fine horse.

Sultan Mahmout is in a [...] phrenzy because Vely has not joined the army. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> here, [...] that the Russians have beaten the Turks and taken Muchtar Pacha [...] prisoner, but it is a Greek Bazaar rumour and not to be believed.|$|R

40|$|Please {{be on the}} {{look-out}} for {{the green}} alder sawfly, a new invasive defoliator of alder. It has been found at several locations in Alaska and one adult was identified from a photo taken in Clark County, Washington. We {{would like to have}} better records of where it occurs in Washington. So if you see any distinctly green sawfly larvae feeding this spring, please collect specimens and take photos. Live larvae would be preferred (keep in a sealed ziplock bag inflated with air). Adults can be put in vials with alcohol. Please contact me for information on where and how to send specimens. I’m also interested in reports of defoliation by other species of sawfly. Another species that feeds on alder is the striped alder sawfly. In fall 2009, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of striped alder sawfly defoliation near Centralia. Sawflies resemble caterpillars of moths or butterflies, but they are actually wasps. One way to tell is that sawfly larvae have more than 5 pairs of prolegs (those sticky leg-like appendages on the abdomen). Thanks for your interest...|$|R

40|$|Readers of {{this journal}} are {{familiar}} with the idea of stance in reading. As Rosenblatt (1978) showed, our response to literature can involve an efferent stance, in which we seek information, or an aesthetic stance, in which we respond to the text as <b>an</b> artwork. Others <b>have</b> id entified ways that individual readers develop their own stances toward a text, e verything from resistance to the idea of reading to deep immersion in which one ’s own life is played out in a fictional narrative. Although it is easy for us to see a novel o r a poem as an artwork, and to imagine different stances one might take t oward that work, it may be more dif-ficult to envision a computer system in su ch a way. Our language leads us away from conceiving of the computer as worth y of a stance when we say “it’s just a tool ” or “it’s only a bunch of 0 s and 1 s. ” Bu t our stance toward a technology may be all the more powerful because we do no t recognize it as such. When we think that we are simply operating a machine, w e cannot see the many ways that our psychological processes shape how we use and interpret it. This month <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> on the researc...|$|R
