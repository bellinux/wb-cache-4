2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> it, and it gave what I was doing a lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where I saw myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound.

The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me," [...] he continued, in a voice of great agitation, [...] "was of trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>about</b> two years afterwards, of her divorce.
