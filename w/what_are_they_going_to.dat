500|$|Father Ernest Sugule, {{national}} {{coordinator of the}} Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in Dungu, DRC, claimed that the few people there [...] "who have succeeded in watching [...] are very critical on the film," [...] as is he himself. Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the London School of Economics (LSE), said Invisible Children ,"haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate. ... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|A radio {{newscast}} {{reported on}} the Chicago Tribune's scoop of the [...] "confession," [...] which Heirens heard in his cell. He was incredulous, stating:I didn't confess to anybody, honestly! My God, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pin on me next? State's Attorney Tuohy also absolutely denied that Heirens had made a confession.|$|E
2500|$|Hoggard was {{considered}} a scapegoat for his sudden falling out of favour the England and Wales Cricket Board. [...] "We've had the same problems with the ECB since I started international cricket," [...] {{he wrote in his}} book. [...] "There were people slagging them off when I first came in and there are people still slagging them off. [...] And it's not the ECB who pick the side anyway. [...] See {{if you can find a}} player with a good word to say about the ECB. [...] <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, sue me for telling the truth?" ...|$|E

6000|$|That <b>was</b> just <b>what</b> I came {{to inquire}} about. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> {{to do with}} the Chinese {{decoration}} all over Penang? Would they try to wisely obliterate that? ...|$|R
60|$|His mind next {{turned to}} his {{immediate}} future. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to do with him? On this point he felt tolerably comfortable. This imprisonment could mean {{nothing more than that}} he would be compelled to disgorge a ransom. This did not trouble him. He was rich, and, now that the situation had been switched to a purely business basis, he felt that he could handle it.|$|R
2500|$|Some writers {{describe}} {{the film as}} a [...] "microcosm" [...] displaying a [...] "weakness {{of the world that}} permitted the rise of Hitler." [...] Kramer does not disagree, and writes, [...] "Even though we never mention him [...] in the picture, his ascendancy is an ever-present factor. Most of the passengers on the ship are Germans, returning to their fatherland at a time when millions of other Germans {{are looking for ways to}} escape." [...] In a scene noted by Spoto as an example, a Nazi passenger is [...] "barking inanities" [...] about how Germans should purify their race, to which a German-Jewish passenger responds, [...] "There are nearly a million Jews in Germany. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do—kill us all?" ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{paper has}} the purpose {{to analyze the}} {{statement}} by Drucker (1985) that rapid changes in today’s society, technology, and economy in general are simultaneously a great threat to public-service institutions and even greater opportunity. The statement by Drucker will be analyzed  particularly with context of post offices that <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> through these days or have gone through.

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] Jethro said gravely. [...] "If they dig {{through our}} walls we shall certainly, as you say, drive {{them out of}} their holes; but I cannot believe that that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do." ...|$|R
5000|$|Soon after Mulholland's release, Charlayne Hunter-Gault and Hamilton E. Holmes {{became the}} first African American {{students}} to enroll at the University of Georgia. Mulholland thought, “Now if whites were going to riot when black students were going to white schools, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to do if a white student went to a black school?” She then {{became the first}} white student to enroll in Tougaloo College in Jackson, where she met Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Ed King, and Anne Moody.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} long it will last," [...] Brooks' {{neighbour}} remarked, cynically. [...] "The manufacturers are like a lot of children with a new toy. What about the Colonies? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{does not}} look like a prison. I should say that it was a cellar, in the house of one of the gang that set upon me. It is evident that someone has betrayed me, {{probably}} that Jew, Ben Soloman. What have they brought me here for? I wonder <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|The crowd {{gathered}} around them, still very threatening in attitude, yet clearly afraid to approach within arm's-length of the strangers. Muriel was much frightened at their noise and at their frantic gestures. [...] "Come away," [...] she cried, catching Felix {{by the arm}} once more. [...] "Oh, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to us? Will they kill us for this? I'm so horribly afraid! Oh, why did I ever do it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|When {{she went}} down-stairs she {{encountered}} her father. He looked impressive, triumphant! His effort at evasion did not deceive Lenore. But she realized {{at once that}} in this instance she could not get any news from him. He said everything was all right and that I.W.W. men were to be deported from Washington. But {{he did not want}} any supper, and he had a low-voiced, significant interview with Dorn. Lenore longed to know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> pending. Dorn's voice, when he said at his door, [...] "Anderson, I'll go!" [...] was ringing, hard, and deadly. It frightened Lenore. Go where? <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to do? Lenore thought of the vigilantes her father had organized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Number three answers that," [...] he said, [...] "and here it is: Men {{and things}} are so made that they have {{different}} likes. A rabbit likes a vegetarian diet. A lynx likes meat. Ducks swim; chickens are scairt of water. One man collects postage stamps, another man collects butterflies. This man goes in for paintings, that man goes in for yachts, and some other fellow for hunting big game. One man thinks horse-racing is It, with a big I, and another man finds the biggest satisfaction in actresses. They can't help these likes. They have them, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do about it? Now I like gambling. I like to play the game. I want to play it big and play it quick. I'm just made that way. And I play it." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{therefore}} {{she asked}} him {{what they were going}} to make him, it was as though some sarcastic housekeeper in a great establishment should ask the butler,--some butler too prone to yield in such matters,--whether the master had appointed him lately to the cleaning of shoes or the carrying of coals. Since these knots had become so very tight, and since the journeys to Windsor had become so very frequent, her Grace had asked many such questions, and had received but very indifferent replies. The Duke had sometimes declared that the matter was not ripe enough to allow him to make any answer. [...] "Of course," [...] said the Duchess, [...] "you should keep the secret. The editors of the evening papers haven't known it for above an hour." [...] At another time he told her that he had undertaken to give Mr. Gresham his assistance in any way in which it might be asked. [...] "Joint Under-Secretary with Lord Fawn, I should say," [...] answered the Duchess. Then he told her that he believed an attempt would be made at a mixed ministry, but that he did not in the least know to whom the work of doing so would be confided. [...] "You will be about the last man who will be told," [...] replied the Duchess. Now, at this moment, he had, as she knew, come direct from the house of Mr. Gresham, and she asked her question in her usual spirit. [...] "And <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make you now?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Shonku {{tries to}} prove that human civilization has prospered thanks to {{the help of some}} alien {{civilisation}} that comes to Earth every 5000 years and teaches them something extraordinary. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reveal this time? ...|$|E
60|$|Just {{as soon as}} they dared, {{they dropped}} the hat and then {{separated}} and rushed away in all directions across the Green Meadows, over to the Green Forest, and down to the Smiling Pool. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> for? Why, to hunt for some of Grandfather Frog's friends and ask their help. You see, the Merry Little Breezes could make Farmer Brown's boy drop Grandfather Frog, but they couldn't untie a knot or cut a string, and this <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> had got to be done to set Grandfather Frog free, for his hind-legs were tied together. So now <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for some one with sharp teeth, who thought enough of Grandfather Frog to come and help him.|$|R

5000|$|There were no {{separate}} stages. Abramović and {{the visitors}} {{stood in the}} same space, {{making it clear that}} the latter were part of the work. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: [...] "What is the public about and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do in this kind of situation?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Ćiribiribela was {{released}} {{at the end}} of 1988. Recorded during the political crisis in Yugoslavia, the album was marked by the band's leader Goran Bregović's pacifist efforts: the album cover featured Edward Hicks' painting Noah's Ark on the cover, the song [...] "Lijepa naša" [...] ("Our Beautiful") featured the national anthem of Croatia [...] "Lijepa naša domovino" [...] ("Our Beautiful Homeland") combined with the Serbian World War I song [...] "Tamo daleko" [...] ("There, Far Away"), and the title track featured lyrics about a couple which wonders <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do if war begins, and concludes {{that they are going to}} [...] "stay at home and kiss".|$|E
5000|$|In April 2000, DreamWorks Studios optioned {{two stories}} from the satirical newspaper, [...] "Canadian Girlfriend Unsubstantiated"—which was to be written by former Onion editor and writer Rich Dahm—and [...] "Tenth Circle Added to Rapidly Growing Hell" [...] with an eye towards {{producing}} the later as a family comedy. [...] "The story is so dark and hate filled—I was shocked", said head writer Todd Hanson. [...] "It's like an Onion joke. I mean, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?

6000|$|The next {{afternoon}} {{as the train}} approached Plainton, Mrs. Cliff found herself a great deal agitated as {{she thought of the}} platform at the station. Who would be there,--how should she be met? With all her heart she hoped that there would not be anything like a formal reception, and yet this was not improbable. Everybody knew she was coming; everybody knew by what train she would arrive. She had written to Willy Croup, and she was very sure that everybody knew everything that she had written. More than this, everybody knew that she was coming home rich. How rich <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not aware, because she had not gone into particulars on this subject, but they knew that the wealthy Mrs. Cliff would arrive at 5.20 that afternoon, and <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>going</b> to do about it? ...|$|R
