5|$|The Ontario government's normal {{process for}} highway {{construction}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> given the financial {{constraints of the}} recession of the early 1990s. The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology. Two firms bid on the project, with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway.|$|E
5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern Europe {{was the issue}} of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East European states were still bourgeois entities, because revolution from above <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible,</b> and capitalism persisted.|$|E

5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to screen stag films in public theaters {{due to the}} Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, electors from the zelanti faction {{attempted}} to elect Giuseppe Renato Imperiali, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> because of his unpopularity with both France and Spain. Following this attempt cardinals representing the Bourbons insisted that no serious attempt to elect a new pope take place until all cardinals who were traveling had arrived, and until the electors had received instructions from the various Catholic monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> {{to upgrade}} Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, {{was built to}} replace it. Gardner became an {{assessment}} centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses {{both on and off}} campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, {{the wife of}} the god Pluto, would be a good name for the object. The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to an extent that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to {{determine}} if the scattered human remains of at least four people belonged to one burial or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E
5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which {{were intended to}} be low-cost variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to certify the avionics software.|$|E

5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Dr. Joe McInnis and Woodman {{organised}} {{an attempt}} to identify the priority targets from the year before. A chartered aircraft landed on the ice at three of the locations, a hole was drilled through the ice, and a small sector-scan sonar was used to image the sea bottom. Unfortunately, due to ice conditions and uncertain navigation, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to exactly confirm {{the locations of the}} holes, and nothing was found although hitherto-unknown depths were found at the locations that were consistent with Inuit testimony of the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Luxembourg {{has been}} an {{independent}} grand duchy since 9 June 1815. Originally, Luxembourg was in personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 16 March 1815 until 23 November 1890. While Wilhelmina succeeded Willem III in the Netherlands, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> in Luxembourg due {{to the order of}} succession being based on Salic law at that time; he was succeeded instead by Adolphe. In a referendum held on 28 September 1919, 80.34 per cent voted in favor of keeping the monarchy. The current monarch is Henri.|$|E

5|$|Most {{schools were}} {{residential}} whereby {{both teachers and}} students resided as a rule. The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in. Each student was offered a lodging where he would resort, a teacher to instruct him in whatever art he requested, and regular grants to cover all his needs. Madrasas were considered prestigious institutions in society. Under the Ayyubids, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to obtain {{a job in the}} government without receiving an education from a madrasa.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a jawbone on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the jawbone was not from Holloway, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> {{to determine whether it}} had come from a man or woman.|$|E

A regular repair <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.|$|E

5|$|Since 2009, Aberdeen {{has been}} {{examining}} {{a move to}} a new stadium. Plans for a new stadium began when the club indicated that further development of Pittodrie Stadium <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> due to the age of the ground and the restrictions from surrounding land. Aberdeen City Council approved an initial project in May 2009, to be situated near Loirston Loch in the south of the city, subject to planning permission. In August 2010, a planning application for the new stadium was submitted to the council, which was approved the following February.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} with Richards' transformation {{from the point}} of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included series connected elements. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to implement in planar technologies and was often inconvenient in other technologies. This problem was solved by K. Kuroda who used impedance transformers to eliminate the series elements. He published a set of transformations known as Kuroda's identities in 1955, but his work was written in Japanese and it was several years before his ideas were incorporated into the English-language literature.|$|E
