5000|$|The game {{received}} [...] "mixed" [...] reviews {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. It was inspired from other {{games of the}} genre, most notably Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and <b>WinBack.</b>|$|E
50|$|The player {{does not}} have {{unlimited}} pistol ammunition, like in <b>Winback.</b> Various weapons are found either on a character from the beginning or from arrested enemies. Weapons include machine gun, sniper rifle, grenades, claymores, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Omega Force (ω-Force) is a {{division}} of Koei. Omega Force are most well known for its Dynasty Warriors series, including spin-offs such as Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi, amongst others. As well as non-Warriors titles such as Dragon Quest Heroes, <b>WinBack,</b> Attack on Titan and Toukiden.|$|E
5000|$|<b>WinBack,</b> {{released}} in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, pioneered the cover-based third-person shooter, inspiring titles such as Kill Switch and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. It also featured an early {{rendition of the}} laser sight mechanic, which would later be seen in titles such as Resident Evil 4. The cover system has since become {{a staple of the}} third-person shooter genre.|$|E
50|$|In particular, the 'Route' based {{system of}} {{gameplay}} for <b>Winback</b> 2 was greatly criticised. Game reviewers {{stated that the}} process becomes drawn-out, tiresome, and even annoying in the later stages. The review from GameTrailers was particularly harsh {{on the lack of}} fun they derived from both the multiplayer and the random deaths of the 30-level single player campaign, awarding the game a score of 4.7 out of 10.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{influenced}} by Metal Gear Solid and, in turn, WinBacks cover system eventually went on to influence several later shooters, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001) and Kill Switch (2003), which in turn influenced games like Gears of War (2006). The cover system has since become a staple of third-person shooters. <b>WinBack</b> also featured a laser-sight mechanic that was later incorporated in action games such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and Resident Evil 4 (2005), and in turn would also become a staple of third-person shooters.|$|E
50|$|A {{cover system}} is a video game {{gameplay}} mechanic that allows a virtual avatar to hide from and avoid dangers, usually in a three-dimensional world. This method is a digital adaptation of the real-life military tactic of taking cover behind obstacles, for purposes of attaining protection from enemy ranged or area effect attacks, such as gunfire or explosions. Similar gameplay elements {{can be traced back}} to as early as 1986, in Rolling Thunder. Later games which refined the system include Bonanza Bros., Blackthorne, Time Crisis, Metal Gear Solid, <b>WinBack,</b> Police 911, Splinter Cell, Kill Switch, Gears of War, Uncharted, Mass Effect and Vanquish.|$|E
50|$|As a {{relatively}} straightforward third-person shooter, the most distinguishing characteristic of Kill Switch is its cover system, a mechanic {{that has the}} player character taking cover behind objects and around corners {{in a manner similar}} to Namco's own Time Crisis series of light gun shooters as well as Koei's third-person shooter <b>WinBack</b> and Konami's stealth game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. However, Kill Switch was the first third-person shooter to feature the cover system as its core game mechanic, and introduced the blind fire mechanic to the cover system (though cover and blind fire mechanics were earlier used in The Getaway).|$|E
50|$|The first 3D third-person shooter {{to include}} a closer-to-modern cover system was <b>Winback,</b> {{released}} by Koei for the Nintendo 64 in 1999. Unlike other third-person shooters at the time, the game did not allow players to run-and-gun, but instead forced them to stop and shoot, with crates and corners providing cover for the player character to pop out from and fire his weapon. In 2000, the arcade light gun shooter Police 911 introduced a unique cover system, where the player takes cover by physically ducking for cover (detected by motion-sensing technology) rather than pressing a button.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, CT Special Forces: Fire for Effect {{featured}} a cover system inspired by Kill Switch. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, released in 2007, also began development that year, and took inspiration from Kill Switch for its cover system. In 2006, several shooters featured Kill Switch-inspired cover systems, including Rogue Trooper, a third-person shooter released in May {{based on the}} eponymous comic book series by 2000 AD, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas, a first person shooter released in November that switched to a third-person over-the-shoulder view when initiating cover, and Killzone: Liberation, a third-person action game released in October. Other third-person shooters to feature a cover system that same year include <b>WinBack</b> 2: Project Poseidon, released in April, and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter.|$|E
5000|$|Jean-Luc finds both Lisa and Jake {{dead in the}} {{generator}} room, both presumably killed by Jin, the elusive (bad ending) Crying Lions boss whom Jean-Luc faces and kills in {{the generator}} room should he arrive fast enough (the good ending). Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc finds Cecile waiting for him. Cecile tells Jean-Luc {{that he was too}} late, the satellite has already fired twice, destroying the Pentagon and White house. Jean-Luc confronts and kills Cecile and goes to the communications room to find Kenneth Coleman, pleased that his [...] "objective" [...] and [...] "cause" [...] was a success. After some talk, Kenneth shoots himself. Jean-Luc and Keith are the only survivors of Operation <b>Winback,</b> which is ultimately a failure.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty {{featured}} a more developed cover system, with Snake or Raiden {{able to take}} cover behind walls, boxes or crates and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player character. The enemies would often take cover to call for backup, and during battle, they would take cover then pop out and shoot at the player or blindly throw grenades from behind their cover. Both <b>WinBack</b> and Metal Gear Solid 2 also {{featured a}} laser sight mechanic, where a laser sight from the gun assists with aiming, which would later become a staple of cover-based third-person shooters. In 2002, The Getaway for the PS2 featured a similar cover mechanic.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} gameplay mechanic {{that helped}} revolutionize third-person shooters {{in the past}} decade was the cover system. An early cover system was introduced to the 3D third-person shooter genre by Koei's <b>WinBack</b> (1999), and was further developed in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001). Namco's Kill Switch (2003) was later the earliest third-person shooter to feature the cover system as its core game mechanic, along with a blind fire mechanic. Gears of War (2006) employed tactical elements such as taking cover, influenced by Kill Switch, using off-center viewpoints inspired by Resident Evil 4. The game also employed grittier themes than other titles and used a unique feature which rewarded the player for correctly reloading weapons. Gears of War, as well as games such as Army of Two (2008), place a greater emphasis on two player cooperative play, as does Resident Evil 5 (2009). As of 2009, the third-person shooter genre has a large audience outside Japan, particularly in North America.|$|E
5000|$|A rogue U.S. Special Forces unit dubbed [...] "Black Hand" [...] {{has joined}} forces with a {{terrorist}} group called [...] "The Minutemen." [...] Together they have taken control of a vast nuclear arsenal in a top secret military installation at sea and seized the activation codes for a weapon known only as [...] "Project Poseidon." [...] The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means the difference between justice and annihilation. The player controls {{one or two of}} the three CRT (Crisis Response Team) members. Led by CO Jack Walcott, the new <b>WinBack</b> assault team is composed of three young, yet combat-proven, operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at close quarters combat (CQC). The player's objective is to complete 30 missions of action, strategy, stealth, rescuing, escorting, and various types of essential goals to stop the terrorists.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{reaching}} the satellite control room, Jean-Luc encounters Dan, who reveals he is a traitor, {{the killer of}} both Steve and Thomas, and forces Jean-Luc into a confrontation. After a fierce battle, Dan is mortally wounded and tells Jean-luc his reasons for his betrayal of the team: he is half-Saroczian. The war split his family in two, his mother and sister defected to Russia with him in tow, whilst his brother and father joined the Saroczian Revolution. Several years later after the separation, he joined the Army and was eventually sent on a mission by the US Forces {{to keep the government}} in power by quashing the revolution supported by a majority of the people. The mission was carried out but Dan was filled with regrets which he says fate was responsible for. He also met his brother, Kenneth Coleman, leader of the Crying Lions who fought to end the suffering of the Saroczian people and avenge his father's death. Dan subsequently dies of his wounds, and Cecile, who survived being shot by Dan earlier, appears and fights one last battle against Jean-Luc in which she is ultimately killed. Once the confrontation is over, Lisa arrives to discover that both Cecile and Dan are dead. Jean-luc Convinces Lisa to destroy the GULF satellite, believing it is too powerful for any one country to control. The GULF satellite is destroyed as Jean-Luc, Keith, and Lisa escape, with Operation <b>Winback</b> ending in success.|$|E
40|$|<b>Winback</b> actions {{refer to}} incumbents ‘ {{strategies}} aimed at regaining former customers who {{switched to a}} new entrant. In most countries {{an increasing number of}} dominant firms across industry sectors are recurring to <b>winback</b> strategies after entry has occurred. Consequently, antitrust authorities have been asked to evaluate the impact of <b>winback</b> on post-entry competition. If from one side, these strategies are clearly the result of competition to the benefits of customers, from the other, as some antitrust and regulatory authorities recently pointed out, they may generate substantial anticompetitive effects. In this paper we outline some counterintuitive results. First we argue that, under given conditions, incumbent‘s <b>winback</b> strategy is rational only when it is exclusionary. Moreover, <b>winback</b> strategies might block off competitor‘s expansion after entry, thus generating the same outcome raised by standard exclusionary practices. We finally discuss the consumers welfare effects of a temporarily ban on incumbent‘s <b>winback</b> against new entrants...|$|E

40|$|For both {{academics}} and practitioners, the dominant focus of {{customer relationship management}} has been customer retention. The authors assert that customer <b>winback</b> should also be {{an important part of}} a cus-tomer relationship management strategy. Customer <b>winback</b> focuses on the reinitiation and management of relationships with customers who have lapsed or defected from a firm. In some cases, firms engage in extensive efforts to reacquire lapsed customers or defectors, and a com-mon tactic is lowering the price to reacquire a customer. This investiga-tion goes beyond the reacquisition pricing strategy and also examines the optimal pricing strategy when the customer has decided to reinitiate the relationship. By simultaneously modeling reacquisition and duration of the second tenure with the firm, the authors determine that the optimal pricing strategy for their application involves a low reacquisition price and higher prices when customers have been reacquired. In addition to pric-ing strategy, they also discuss the implications of their findings for target-ing lapsed customers for reacquisition...|$|E
40|$|The {{industry}} {{literature is}} full {{of the idea of}} winning back lapsed customers. Yet marketing practitioners and academics know very little about what happens to customers after they stop buying the brand. This research investigates the brand equity of lapsed customers of five major financial institutions. The analysis compares the propensity for positive and/or negative brand associations, overall brand evaluation, and the propensity to consider the brand in the future across the main segments of lapsed customers. The results show that the group of lapsed customers is not homogenous, but consists of distinct segments. Customers who defected for different reasons also differ in their post-defection brand equity. The paper concludes with implications for <b>winback</b> strategies for lapsed customers and brand equity measurement and management. ...|$|E
30|$|Customer {{win-back}} is {{a cognitive}} process of satisfaction changing {{from a low}} level to a high level with service recovery strategies as the stimulus. Because prior research tends to view service recovery strategies as a static antecedent, {{it is difficult to}} analyze and observe how the recovery strategies affect satisfaction and repurchase intention dynamically. Moreover, not enough attention has been directed to the relationship between reasons of customer loss and recovery strategies. This research conducted a field experiment involving a 2 × 2 between-subjects design (defects of service attitude and unfair price × tangible recovery and intangible recovery strategies). From a longitudinal and dynamic perspective, this study has produced the following key results: First, there are significant differences in satisfaction and purchase intention between the four groups categorized by specific reasons of customer loss. Second, recovery strategies may have non-linear effects on customer’s satisfaction. Lastly, based on the prospect theory and disappointment theory, we discuss important managerial implications of the function curves fitted between customer satisfactory (before customer loss and after implementation of customer <b>winback</b> strategy) and purchase intention.|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 30). Bharti airtel started its telecom services business by launching mobile services in Delhi of India in 1995. From then it {{has become one of}} the top telecom companies in the World and it is also in the list of top five wireless operators in the World. In January 2010, Bharti Airtel Limited, Asia’s leading integrated telecom services provider, acquired 70 % stake in Warid Telecom, Bangladesh. Since then the journey of airtel in Bangladesh has started. But officially the activities with the brand “airtel” started on 20 th, December, 2011 in Bangladesh. In the overall report I have tried to focus mainly how airtel conduct collection and retention activities along with different mechanisms. There are different categories of the customers who are using post paid. These categories are also mentioned. In the collection department, they do follow up activities by their teams who are very efficient and dedicated. They do follow up based on the customer type means the customers who have not been using the number for at least 2 years but they are in connected mode. Their number is active but they are not using the number for a long time. This type of follow up is called hardcore follow up. On the other hand, collection team does follow up activities to the new subscribers and this kind of follow up is called soft-core follow up. On the contrary, some different activities are conducted in retention management. Basically the activities are far more difficult in a sense that the employees who are involved in retention activities have to work hard to get the customers back in the airtel service again. But it is not easy to <b>winback</b> the customers who have already left airtel service for different issues. The activities include follow up activities, properly make the customers learn the packages they are using and the benefits of it. Package conversion is also done based on customers’ requirements. I have tried to find out the real facts of the departments. Meanwhile I have included my suggestions and recommendations in order to eradicate the weaknesses of their department. Finally I have ended my report through including references and sources that I have used to make this report. Mir Rajib HossainB. Business Administratio...|$|E
