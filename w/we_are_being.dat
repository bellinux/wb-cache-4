Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> rehabilitated and this could help our case. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E

We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E

Looking to the future, he predicted a time when [...] "there is a growing mountain of research.

500|$|In 1975 {{psychologist}} Lawrence Casler {{called for}} empirical {{research into the}} relative frequencies of career-appropriate names to establish {{if there is an}} effect at work or whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> [...] "seduced by Lady Luck". He proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics – attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.|$|E

500|$|The {{phrase is}} used to accuse {{politicians}} and artists of selling out their principles or ideals, and is also used in literature {{as a symbol of}} betrayal. For example, {{in the aftermath of the}} 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, a number of residents of the street in which the Governor General John Kerr had been born sent the Governor 30 pieces of silver, as Kerr was widely blamed for the crisis. Another usage was at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, a spokesman from Tuvalu criticised the final document by saying, [...] "It looks like <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future... Our future is not for sale." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you think that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|In her 2004 book Life Long Learning: Transforming, Learning Discovering Through Living Life in Unlimitless Possibilities, Patti Diamond {{writes that}} filmmakers The Wachowskis got the {{inspiration}} for the screenplay to The Matrix Revolutions while participating in a Landmark Forum [...] "seminar series." [...] Diamond also analyzes The Matrix Revolutions and the messages imparted in the film, in the context of her own personal experiences in the Landmark Forum. [...] She describes a tautologous exchange between Agent Smith and Neo in the film, where Neo is asked by Smith: [...] "Why do you continue to do this, Mr. Anderson?" [...] and Neo responds: [...] "Because I choose to." [...] Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of [...] "choice and decision." [...] Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: [...] "we all choose to BE who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> in each and every moment of our experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Wilkins, {{a history}} {{professor}} at George Mason University who studies race in the United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] provided [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of where we came from and who <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Being</b> fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E
500|$|Gernsback's {{declared}} {{goals for}} Amazing were {{to educate and}} to entertain. [...] In the editorial for the first issue he asserted that [...] "Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading – they are also always instructive. [...] They supply knowledge that we might not otherwise obtain – and they supply {{it in a very}} palatable form. [...] For the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us aware that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing. [...] The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply [...] "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".|$|E
2500|$|A new protest {{was held}} by Palestinian journalists outside the Gaza Parliament on 17 April. However, armed guards outside the {{building}} turned violent against the protesters, hitting them with their rifles, leading one journalist to comment that [...] "we came peacefully, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> assaulted now." [...] Three journalists were injured. RSF condemned the violence, {{saying that it was}} [...] "outraged by this violence against journalists who had gone to express their fears and emotion about Johnston's fate." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{philosophy}} discovers {{something wrong}} with science, sometimes science has to be changed—Russell's paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley's attack on the actual infinitesimal—but more often it is philosophy {{that has to be}} changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> offered on every hand are wrong, and that [...] "philosophical interpretation" [...] is just what mathematics doesn't need.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading {{noted that}} overall, Foucault's work was [...] "dark and pessimistic", {{but that it}} did leave some room for optimism, in that it {{illustrates}} how the discipline of philosophy {{can be used to}} highlight areas of domination. In doing so, Stokes claimed, we are able to understand how <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> dominated and strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualises people.|$|E
2500|$|... … {{in most of}} the {{authoritative}} treatments of Plato, after a scholarly reference to [...] lecture on the Good, the singular becomes an unexplained plural within the paragraph, the lecture a whole series of lectures, and before the section has been finished <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> told that Plato gave [...] "regular lectures," [...] "systematic and continuous expositions in lecture form on {{some of the most important}} points in his doctrine."' This [...] "expansion" [...] of the evidence -- if I may use the term -- has been embellished by the different expositors with different details, a comparison of which would afford a certain cynical amusement to the historian of critical scholarship.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009 {{the islands}} stalled talks at United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, fearing some other {{developing}} countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emission, their chief negotiator stated [...] "Tuvalu {{is one of the}} most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting."

2500|$|After a riot in Bristol in 1980, Powell {{asserted}} that the media were ignoring similar events in south London and Birmingham, and claimed: [...] "Far less than the foreseeable New Commonwealth and Pakistan ethnic proportion would be sufficient to constitute a dominant political force in the United Kingdom able to extract from a government and the main parties terms calculated to render its influence still more impregnable. Far less than this proportion would provide the bases and citadels for urban terrorism, which would in turn reinforce the overt political leverage of simple numbers". He attacked [...] "the false nostrums and promises of those who apparently monopolise the channels of communication.

2500|$|Despite {{the threat}} of protest {{violence}} occurring throughout Venezuela, children were more affected psychologically by the economic crisis than violence. Abel Saraiba, a psychologist of children's rights organization Cecodap stated in 2017, [...] "We have children from {{a very early age}} who are having to think about how to survive", with half of her young clients requiring treatment due to the crisis. Children are often forced to go in food lines or beg with their parents, while the games they play with other children revolve around finding food. In more extreme cases, Friends of the Child Foundation that Amerita Protección (Fundana) psychologist Ninoska Zambrano explains that children are offering sexual services in order to receive food, with Zambrano stating [...] "Families are doing things that not only lead them to break physically, but in general, socially, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> morally broken".|$|E
