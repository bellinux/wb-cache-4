Measures of genetic diversity such as allelic richness, heterozygosity, polymorphism, F-statistics, D-statistics, gene flow and the contributions of each stand to diversity and allelic richness were calculated, clustering using Nei’s genetic distances and a method based on an Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm were used. <b>Wild</b> <b>Spanish</b> chestnut populations displayed heterogeneity of allele frequencies between them, high levels of genetic diversity and high differentiation (Fst = 0. 15) compared with populations from other western European countries. Two clustering methods allowed identification of three clusters: The highest heterozygosity and allelic richness were found in the North and especially in the Galician cluster close to Portugal. These results indicate that probably the northern chestnut populations are relictual originated from a North Iberian refuge.

Some lines derived from the Dutch race have been attacked by mosaic disease only after flowering time. In plants from Palestine a rapid growing line (Pal-type) was found. Rapid growth was due to one dominant gene (Rp). An attempt was made to create highly productive varieties based on the Pal-type and on such types with a rapid juvenile development, resistance to mildew, wilt, mosaic disease, non-shattering pods which are easily threshable, soft- coated seeds and glabrous pods. The author showed how important the wild forms have been for the breeding. Only a small proportion of existing forms had been collected.

40|$|The White-headed Duck is a {{globally}} {{threatened species}} historically recorded from Spain {{in the west}} to China in the east. It has suffered major population declines, local extinctions and range fragmentation. Several projects have attempted to reintroduce captive-bred birds into parts of the former range in Europe, but with little success. Two captive stocks currently exist, one originating from Pakistan in 1968 and the other originating from Spain in 1982. This study compares the suitability of these captive stocks for specific reintroduction projects by using 11 microsatellite markers and mtDNA control region sequences to assess genetic differences between captive populations and wild birds from Spain and Greece. No significant population structure was found and all microsatellite alleles recorded in captive birds originating from Pakistan were also observed in the <b>wild</b> <b>Spanish</b> population. A higher diversity of alleles was observed in wild birds from Greece than from Spain, probably due to the effects of a strong bottleneck experienced in Spain in the 1970 s. Compared with wild populations, both captive stocks have suffered a significant loss of diversity in microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA owing to founder effects and/or genetic drift, and therefore may not be well suited for release programmes. We recommend the development of a more diverse captive breeding programme based on birds taken from different areas of the range, in particular by supplementing the Spanish population with birds from North Africa. Our study shows the value of molecular tools in developing conservation programmes for threatened bird species and has implications for the design of recovery programmes. Keywords...|$|R

In addition, we provide the sequence of three new modern genomes from an Iberian pig, <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> boar and a Guatemalan Creole pig. Comparison with both mitochondrial and autosomal genome data shows that the ancient pig is closely related to extant Iberian pigs and to European wild boar. Although the ancient sample was clearly domestic, admixture with wild boar also occurred, according to the D-statistics. The close relationship between Iberian, European wild boar and the ancient pig confirms that Asian introgression in modern Iberian pigs has not existed or has been negligible. In contrast, the Guatemalan Creole pig clusters apart from the Iberian pig genome, likely due to introgression from international breeds.

40|$|Fatty acid {{composition}} and stable isotope ratios of carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) were determined in muscle tissue of turbot (Psetta maxima). The {{multivariate analysis of}} the data was performed to evaluate their utility in discriminating wild and farmed fish. Wild (n) 30) and farmed (n) 30) turbot of different geographical origins (Denmark, The Netherlands, and Spain) were sampled from March 2006 to February 2007. The application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) to analytical data demonstrated the combination of fatty acids and isotopic measurements to be a promising method to discriminate between wild and farmed fish and between wild fish of different geographical origin. In particular, IRMS (Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) alone did not permit us to separate completely farmed from wild samples, resulting in some overlaps between Danish <b>wild</b> and <b>Spanish</b> farmed turbot. On the other hand, fatty acids alone differentiated between farmed and wild samples by 18 : 2 n- 6 but were not able to distinguish between the two groups of wild turbot. When applying LDA isotope ratios, 18 : 2 n- 6, 18 : 3 n- 3, and 20 : 4 n- 6 fatty acids were decisive to distinguish farmed from wild turbot of different geographical origin, while d 15 N, 18 : 2 n- 6, and 20 : 1 n- 11 were chosen to classify wild samples from different fishing zones. In both cases, 18 : 2 n- 6 and d 15 N were determinant for classification purposes. We would like to emphasize that IRMS produces rapid results and could be the most promising technique to distinguish wild fish of different origin.

This study describes the geographical distribution and molecular typing of 77 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates belonging either to M. bovis or to M. caprae, cultivated from hunter harvested red deer (Cervus elaphus) and European wild boar (Sus scrofa) in 24 Spanish localities, and compares them with spoligotypes detected previously in humans, livestock or wild animals, {{as described in the}} literature. The distribution of the molecular type patterns suggests that the population of M. tuberculosis complex strains isolated from <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> ungulates is spatially structured despite the lack of important geographical barriers and despite the increasingly frequent wildlife translocations. Red deer and the European wild boar can share the same molecular types in localities in which the M. tuberculosis complex was isolated from both species. Strains of bovine and caprine origin do circulate in the same local wildlife populations. Six out of 11 spoligotypes were similar to types described in human cases. The isolation of TB strains in fenced estates from wild animals that have not had contact with domestic livestock for at least the past two decades, strongly suggests that the M. tuberculosis complex is able to survive in these populations.

Here we evaluated the effect of iflavirus co-infection on the insecticidal characteristics of SeMNPV occlusion bodies (OBs). Overall, iflavirus co-inoculation consistently reduced median lethal concentrations (LC 50) for SeMNPV OBs compared to larvae infected with SeMNPV alone. However, the speed of kill of SeMNPV was similar in the presence or absence of the iflaviruses. A reduction of the weight gain (27 %) associated with iflavirus infection resulted in a 30 % reduction in total OB production per larva. Adult survivors of SeMNPV OB inoculation were examined for covert infection. SeMNPV DNA was found to be present at a high prevalence in all SeIV- 1 and SeIV- 2 co-infection treatments. Interestingly, co-inoculation of SeMNPV with SeIV- 2 alone or in mixtures with SeIV- 1 resulted in a significant increase in the SeMNPV load of sublethally infected adults, suggesting a role for SeIV- 2 in vertical transmission or reactivation of sublethal SeMNPV infections. In conclusion, iflaviruses are not desirable in insect colonies used for large scale baculovirus production, as they may result in diminished larval growth, reduced OB production and, depending on their host-range, potential risks to non-target Lepidoptera...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{evolutionary}} history of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) wild-cultivated complex, we adopted a phylogeographical approach {{based on a}} characterization for Mitochondrial DNA variation through restriction fragment length polymorphisms of a sample of natural and cultivated populations. Twenty-two mitotypes were identified in the whole data set (155 individuals, one by population) with five probe/restriction enzymes (4). In the wild pool (M. s. ssp sativa 4 x and M. s. sp coerulea 2 x) from the presumed centre of origin (Near East to Central Asia), the diversity was high but the absence of geographic differentiation hinders a more precise location of the domestication. Within the cultivated alfalfa, the genetic differentiation associated with a geographic structure strongly suggests the existence {{of at least two}} independent routes of dissemination of alfalfa (East and West) from its center of origin. Namely, one original mitotype was detected in the cultivated pool from western Europe and North Africa. Its absence from the wild pool suggests an other wild source for the domesticated form, particularly for European ones (Flemish, Provence). This source could be the subspecies falcata which has been used in alfalfa breeding in the North of Europe; but recurrent gene flow in both directions between cultivated alfalfa and natural populations of ssp. falcata prevents any definitive conclusion. Finally, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> populations (ref 1 to 4), located outside the presumed area of domestication, were shown to be highly original, with one abundant original mitotype.

The spacers in the direct repeat locus are amplified by PCR and are detected by hybridization of the biotin-labelled PCR product with a membrane containing oligonucleotides derived from spacer sequences that have previously been bound to a membrane. One hundred eighty-two M. bovis isolates from domestic animals (cattle, goat, sheep, and cats) and wild animals (deer and wild boar) were spoligotyped, and the results were compared with those obtained by IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Two rather homogeneous clusters of isolates containing 20 and 4 types, respectively, were identified by spoligotyping. The first cluster included isolates from cattle, cats, and feral animals. By spoligotyping, isolates from the <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> boar and deer had the same pattern as some bovine isolates, suggesting transmission between these animals and cattle and highlighting the importance of the study of these reservoirs. The second cluster included all the caprine and ovine isolates. Within each cluster, the patterns of the different strains differed only slightly, suggesting that the spoligotypes may be characteristic of strains from particular animal species. Spoligotyping proved to be useful for studying the epidemiology of bovine M. bovis isolates, especially of those isolates containing only a single copy of IS 6110. In view of our results, we suggest fingerprinting all M. bovis strains by the spoligotyping method initially and then by IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism typing of the strains belonging to the most common spoligotypes...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of the Mediterranean pond turtle. Mauremys leprosa in the Ebre Delta (Catalonia, north-east Spain) is well documented after the late 1970 s, when the first reptile distribution lists were published. Owing {{to the fact that}} the species was considered scarce, a reintroduction programme based on the release of individuals at sites with potential habitat suitability was launched. From 1999 to 2001, 234 turtles of different ages were released and subsequently monitored until 2007, in order to make a conservation diagnosis using five assessment criteria. These criteria were body condition, individual growth, reproduction, survival and population growth rate. Despite the relatively large number of turtles released, no viable population resulted from the programme. Assessment criteria suggested that: (1) released individuals showed good physical condition and satisfactory growth (the only positive results); (2) reproduction was almost absent; (3) local survival was reduced compared with that of <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> populations of the species; (4) temporary emigration was high; (5) the growth rate of the population was negative. In conclusion, the results suggested that the habitat at the Ebre Delta marshes may not be favourable to the species, and that the scarce historical data record may indicate a relatively low-quality habitat; the few records may correspond to individuals dispersing from the river, a more suitable habitat. Thus, we conclude that historically scarce records may be the result of natural patchiness and heterogeneous distributions, and they are not necessarily a good indicator of relict, decimated populations. Good assessment criteria, as those proposed and used here, are necessary tools to assess results in reintroduction projects to recover endangered chelonian populations. © 2009 The Authors.

40|$|Infectious {{pathogens}} {{from wild}} animals {{have become increasingly}} important throughout the world in recent years, as {{they have had a}} substantial impact in livestock and human health. A large number of pathogens (61 % of the 1415 currently identified human pathogens within 313 different genera) are zoonotic and can infect multiple animal species. Multi-host pathogens are predominant among animal and human emerging diseases. Multi-host pathogens (including all zoonotic agents, pathogens that can infect more than one taxonomic order and pathogens that can infect wildlife hosts) have a higher relative risk for emergence than species-specific pathogens. Of 800 zoonotic diseases currently identified, 619 (77 %) are caused by pathogens that affect wildlife; of 125 emerging zoonotic diseases, 113 (90 %) affect wildlife. Of the diseases that have emerged in the last few decades around 75 % are of wildlife origin. Many factors influence changes in disease incidence, including economic, climatic and microbiological effects. Increasingly, close interaction of humans and livestock with wild animals has led to increased frequency of zoonotic infections. Forest clearance and movement of animals or animal products are factors, which pose significant risks of introducing disease into a new region. Changing climate affects disease incidence by changes in land use or animal production practices, as well as by movement or changes in distribution of animal reservoirs or insect vectors. Local increases in biting midges or mosquito numbers, changes in the distribution of known vector species and/or recruitment of novel vector species, have increased the risk of spread or introduction of diseases. Pathogen evolution may occur in response to changes of which humans are not aware. The evolution may be occurring in many hosts, currently poorly monitored. Microbial evolution may affect the extent to which established methods of diagnosis can detect infectious agents. Other endemic diseases may also change in incidence for largely unknown reasons. Increased information on prevalence {{in a wide range of}} hosts will increase our understanding of these reasons. Wildlife can play an important role in the epidemiology of small ruminant and human diseases, by representing a source of disease via various transmission routes. Recent studies in infections of wildlife in Europe have highlighted the impact on small ruminant health. In Greece, blood/organ samples were collected from 60 wild deer and 140 wild boars (2006 - 2011). Serum samples were tested for presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii,Neospora caninum, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, Chlamydophila, Salmonella and Trichinella spirallis, by using appropriate immunodiagnostic techniques. Tissue samples were examined for Mycobacterium bovis by using PCR. In serum samples from deer, antibodies against T. gondii, N. caninum and Chlamydophila were detected in 15 %, 5 % and 5 % of samples, respectively. In serum samples from wild boars, antibodies against Salmonella, T. gondii and T. spirallis were detected in 15 %, 5 % and 5 % of samples, respectively. No M. bovis was found in tissue samples. In Spain, Bluetongue virus, Brucella spp., Coxiella bumetii and M. avium were detected in many <b>wild</b> cervid species. <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> boars have been found to be greatly exposed to Salmonella spp., an important small ruminant intestinal pathogen. In Austria, Spain and Poland, Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been detected in various cervids. Finally, in Poland and Spain, wild deer and wild boars were found to be exposed to T. gondii and N. caninum. The results indicate that wildlife may be carriers of several pathogens, which can be transmitted to domestic small ruminants and their farmers. It is noteworthy that samples from many European countries will be collected and tested to ensure a broader evaluation of the epidemiological role of wildlife. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Thus, investigating {{the role of}} wild carnivores as tick hosts is of relevance for understanding {{the life cycle of}} ticks in natural foci and the epidemiology of TBPs shared with domestic animals and humans. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ixodid tick fauna of wild carnivores in Peninsular Spain and the environmental factors driving the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by ixodid ticks. We hypothesized that the adaptation of tick species to differing climatic conditions may be reflected in a similar parasitization risk of wild carnivores by ticks between bioclimatic regions in our study area. To test this, we surveyed ixodid ticks in wild carnivores in oceanic, continental-Mediterranean, and thermo-Mediterranean bioclimatic regions of Peninsular Spain. We analyzed the influence of environmental factors on the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by ticks by performing logistic regression models. Models were separately performed for exophilic and endophilic ticks under the expected differing influence of environmental conditions on their life cycle. We found differences in the composition of the tick community parasitizing wild carnivores from different bioclimatic regions. Modelling results partially confirmed our null hypothesis because bioclimatic region was not a relevant factor influencing the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by exophilic ticks. Bioclimatic region was however a factor driving the risk of wild carnivores to be parasitized by endophilic ticks. <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> carnivores are hosts to a relevant number of tick species, some of them being potential vectors of pathogens causing serious animal and human diseases. Information provided herein can be of help to understand tick ecology in Spanish wildlife, the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases, and to prevent the risks of TBPs for wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.

Wild ungulates may {{have an important role}} in the maintenance of ixodid tick populations, and also as reservoirs of pathogens. We studied the ixodid ticks that parasitize Iberian red deer and European wild boar from Spain. Ixodid ticks (n = 6336) were collected from 431 Iberian red deer and 142 wild boar in different regions of Spain. We found 10 different ixodid tick species parasitizing Iberian red deer, mainly Hyalomma marginatum marginatum (63. 7 %), Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (7. 9 %) and R. bursa (7. 5 %). R. (Boophilus) annulatus was only collected in the province of Cádiz (southern Spain). We found 8 ixodid tick species on the wild boar, mainly Hy. m. marginatum (68. 7 %), R. bursa (14. 6 %) and Dermacentor marginatus (9. 3 %). We found one adult Hy. marginatum rufipes and one adult Hy. anatolicum excavatum parasitizing wild boar from south-central Spain. Mean prevalence of ixodid ticks was 41. 3 ± 0. 08 % (n = 475) and 31 ± 0. 09 % (n = 284) and intensity of parasitization was 13. 9 ± 0. 2 (n = 283) and 13. 6 ± 0. 3 (n = 130) ticks/animal for Iberian red deer and wild boar, respectively. Only 5 of the 13 ixodid tick species found were shared by Iberian red deer and wild boar. This finding could indicate a host preference when Iberian red deer and wild boar share common habitats. In both Iberian red deer and wild boar from south-central Spain the monthly relative frequencies of Hy. m. marginatum and R. bursa presented an inverse pattern. The highest Hy. m. marginatum relative frequencies coincided with the lowest R. bursa relative frequencies along the year. R. bursa and I. ricinus were present in areas from northern to southern Spain while Hyalomma sp. and D. marginatus were exclusively collected in the two southern thirds of Spain. Haemaphysalis sp. and D. reticulatus were collected in northern Spain. Hy. m. marginatum and R. bursa were present during the whole year in red deer and wild boar from south-central Spain, showing more than one life cycle per year. These results are important for understanding the role of wild ungulates in the maintenance of tick infestations and to improve tick control programmes. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera; Noctuidae), conocida como el taladro del tomate, es una especie polífaga y de amplia distribución, {{responsable}} de grandes pérdidas económicas en más de 60 cultivos a {{lo largo de}} las regiones tropicales y subtropicales del mundo. Estas plagas se controlan mayoritariamente con plaguicidas químicos, aunque existe un gran interés por desarrollar otros agentes de control biológico. Entre estos, se encuentra el nucleopoliedrovirus de Helicoverpa armigera (HearNPV, Baculoviridae), que por sus características de seguridad y eficacia, sería útil para impulsar los programas de gestión integrada de plagas que se fomentan desde la Directiva 2009 / 128 /CEE. El objetivo de este trabajo fue realizar una caracterización bioquímica y biológica de varios aislados de HearNPV : un aislado silvestre español (Badajoz) HearNPV-SP 1, un aislado chino HearSNPV-G 4, tres aislados sudafricanos (HearNPV-Whl, HearNPV-Kzn, HearNPV-Alb) y la materia activa de un producto comercial en uso en Europa (HearNPV-Hx). El análisis con las enzimas de restricción determinó que la enzima BglII generaba perfiles similares pero con fragmentos característicos en todos los casos a excepción de los aislados HearNPV-Kzn y HearNPVAlb, que no pudieron ser diferenciados entre sí con ninguna de las enzimas probadas. El análisis filogenético, basado en las secuencias parciales de los genes poliedrina (polh), lef- 8 y lef- 9, donde se incluyeron las secuencias correspondientes a 18 genomas mostró que el aislado HearNPV-Whl es filogenéticamente próximo a las cepas de origen ibérico, mientras que los aislados HearNPV-Hx y HearNPV-Alb comparten la misma rama que los aislados asiáticos y australiano. La caracterización insecticida de los aislados HearNPV-SP 1, HearNPV-Hx y HearNPV-G 4 reveló que la virulencia (TMM) del aislado HearNPV-SP 1 (104 h) fue significativamente menor que la de los aislados HearNPV-G 4 (109 h) y HearNPV-Hx (111 h). En este trabajo, se determinó que el tiempo de acción del HearNPV-SP 1 es menor al de otros bioinsecticidas en uso en Europa, por lo que se confirma la posibilidad de mejorar los productos activos en uno de los aspectos más sensibles de cara a su comercialización como es su tiempo de actuación. Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), {{known as}} the tomato borer is a key pest widely distributed and responsible for large economic losses in more than 60 crops throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Microbial insecticides are proposed {{as an alternative to}} control this pest, as they exhibit great advantages such as safety for non-target organisms including people exposed to them. Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV; Baculoviridae) has been studied as a promising biological control agent to be implemented in the framework of integrated pest management, and recent EU legislation on the sustainable use of pesticides. This study addressed the biochemical and biological characterization of a collection of HearNPV isolates from different geographic origins including the <b>Spanish</b> <b>wild</b> isolate (Badajoz) HearNPV-SP 1, the Chinese HearSNPV-G 4 isolate, three South Africans isolates (HearNPV- Whl, HearNPV-Kzn, HearNPV-Alb) and the active ingredient of a biopesticides registered in Europe (HearNPV-Hx). The viral DNA analysis with restriction enzymes (REN) showed that BglII profiles distinguished the isolates each other by the presence of characteristic fragments, except to HearNPV-Kzn and HearNPV-Alb that could not be differentiate to one another using any of the tested enzymes. Secondly, a phylogenetic analysis was performed based on partial sequences of the three genes located in a highly conserved region (polyhedrin, late expression factor- 8 and lef- 9). To construct the phylogenetic tree 18 virus genomes were included, four of which were sequenced de novo and the rest obtained from the database Gene-Bank (NCBI). The HearNPV-Whl isolated was found phylogenetically close to the Iberian strains, while the isolates HearNPV-Hx and HearNPV-Alb shared the same branch together with Asian and Australian isolates. No common trend between closest geographically isolated was observed. The biological characterization was performed by bioassays for the three isolated HearNPV-SP 1, HearNPV-Hx, and HearNPV-G 4 in terms of mean time to death (MTD). The MTD value of HearNPV-SP 1 (104 hpi) Spanish isolate was significantly lower than those for the HearNPV-G 4 (109 hpi) and HearNPV-Hx (111 hpi). The Spanish isolate exhibits very desirable characteristics as a biological control agent, being one of the most pathogenic and virulent HearNPV isolates described so far. Here we demonstrated that the HearNPVSP 1 kill faster than the active ingredient of a biopesticide in use in Europe. The reforethis findings may contribute to improve HearNPV-based biopesticides by selecting those genotypes with the best speed of action, which mainly affect their efficiency in fields.
