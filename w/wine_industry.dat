5|$|The {{industry}} {{has had a}} significant economic impact on the state. The industry contributed a total of US$3.35 billion to the Oregon economy. 17,100 people participate in the <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> with $527 million in wages. In 2014 70% was sold to US markets outside Oregon and 4% was sold internationally.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, the <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> had {{weakened}} {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards {{that survived}} by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E

5|$|Mason avoided overdependence {{on tobacco}} {{as a source}} of income by leasing much of his land {{holdings}} to tenant farmers, and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the British West Indies as Virginia's economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia <b>wine</b> <b>industry,</b> subscribing along with other Virginians such as Thomas Jefferson to Philip Mazzei's scheme for growing wine grapes in America.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> {{focuses on}} the higher-priced {{segments}} of the wine market. Oregon growers receive a higher average return per ton and a higher average revenue per case than do growers in other wine-producing regions in the United States. Despite producing a much smaller volume of wine, Oregon winery revenues per capita are {{comparable to those of}} New York and Washington.|$|E
5|$|The accolades {{continued}} into the 1980s, and the Oregon <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> continued to add both wineries and vineyards. The state industry continued to market itself, establishing {{the first of several}} AVAs (American Viticulture Areas) in the state. The state also grew strong ties with the Burgundy region of France, as Oregon's governor Neil Goldschmidt paid an official visit to Burgundy and a leading French winemaking family bought land in Dundee.|$|E

5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc <b>wine</b> <b>industry,</b> killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on the hillside. In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many vineyards that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|Oregon {{produces}} wine on a {{much smaller}} scale than the California <b>wine</b> <b>industry.</b> Oregon's leading producer, King Estate, ships only 401,400 cases per year and most produce under 35,000cases. The state features many small wineries that produce less than 5,000cases per year. In contrast, E & J Gallo, the United States' largest winery with more than 50 different brands including Washington's Columbia Winery and Covey Run holds 22.8% share of the US market. The majority of wineries in the state operate their own vineyards, although some purchase grapes on the market. Oregon contains {{a significant number of}} independent vineyards.|$|E
50|$|Summerland {{is home to}} one of Canada's largest <b>wine</b> <b>industries.</b> Many of Summerland's wineries are {{connected}} by the famed 'Bottleneck Drive.' Famed wineries include Thornhaven, Dirty Laundry, Sleeping Giant, Sonoran, SummerGate, Sumac Ridge, Vinegar Works, Hollywood Wine, Heaven's Gate, SilkScarf, 8th Generation and Estate Thurn.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Kendall-Jackson {{rejected}} the California <b>wine</b> <b>industry's</b> trend toward vineyard-specific wine labeling. It ignored {{the concept of}} terroir in favor of blending wines from different regions to achieve desired wine characteristics. They reversed that direction in the mid-2000s, along with a push to upgrade their quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{vicinity}} of Zhangjiakou {{is rich in}} coal and iron ore, making it an ideal location for developing iron and steel industry. Apart from metallurgy, the city is {{home to one of}} China's most important grape <b>wine</b> <b>industries,</b> with the Great Wall Wine Company being located in Shacheng, Huailai County.|$|R
5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> to the labeling of varietal wines and the blending of international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'Hérault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery capitalized on this new horizon, producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} of plant susceptibility to pests was probably known {{even in the}} early stages of agriculture in humans. In historic times, the observation of such variations in susceptibility have provided solutions for major socio-economic problems. The grape phylloxera was introduced from North America to France in 1860 and in 25 years it destroyed nearly a third (100,000km²) of the French grape yards. Charles Valentine Riley noted that the American species Vitis labrusca was resistant to Phylloxera. Riley, with J. E. Planchon, helped save the French <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> by suggesting the grafting of the susceptible but high quality grapes onto Vitis labrusca root stocks.|$|E

50|$|As {{recipients}} of winemaking knowledge from areas to the east, the Phoenicians {{were instrumental in}} distributing wine, wine grapes, and winemaking technology throughout the Mediterranean region through their extensive trade network. Their use of amphoras for transporting wine was widely adopted and Phoenician-distributed grape varieties were important {{in the development of}} the <b>wine</b> <b>industries</b> of Rome and Greece.|$|R
5|$|While the {{cultivation}} of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been bolstered by the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.|$|E
5|$|Wine {{has been}} {{produced}} in Oregon since the Oregon Territory was {{settled in the}} 1840s; however, winemaking has only been a significant industry in the state since the 1960s. Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847. Valley View,the first recorded winery, was established by Peter Britt in the late 1850s in Jacksonville. Throughout the 19th century, there was experimentation with various varietals by immigrants to the state. In 1904, an Oregon winemaker won a prize at the St. Louis World's Fair. Wine production stopped in the United States during Prohibition. As in other states, the Oregon <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> lay dormant for thirty years after Prohibition was repealed.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County <b>wine</b> <b>industry.</b> Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local <b>wine</b> <b>industry,</b> and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E

40|$|This {{discussion}} {{focuses on}} the issue of advertising alcohol on television. It first provides a look back into the history of the controversies that have surrounded alcohol since the 1800 's. This history explores {{the rise and fall of}} prohibition and discusses legislation that has both passed and failed over the years. The alcohol debates are then divided into two categories, hard liquor and beer. The discussion of liquor {{focuses on the}} debate that has ensued following the industry's lifting of its 50 -year voluntary ban on television advertising. The discussion that focuses on the beer and <b>wine</b> <b>industries</b> takes a look at arguments that have risen concerning advertising by these industries since the beginning of the 1990 's. It also explores the possible effects that liquor's move onto television could have on the beer and <b>wine</b> <b>industries</b> as well as what effects advertising restrictions placed on brewers would have on the economy and the general public. Finally, the discussion looks at what lies ahead for alcohol and its battle for a place on the airwaves. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
5|$|Sauvignon blanc can {{be greatly}} {{influenced}} by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision {{is the amount of}} contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In {{the early years of the}} New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>industry,</b> there were no wineries on the South Island which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's <b>wine</b> <b>industry</b> and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|The three {{principal}} {{cities of}} the Bay Area represent different employment clusters and are dominated by different, but commingled, industries. San Francisco {{is home to the}} region's financial and business industry, tourism, and is host to numerous conventions. The East Bay, centered around Oakland, is home to heavy industry, metalworking, oil, and shipping, while Silicon Valley is a major pole of economic activity around the technology industry. Furthermore, the North Bay is {{a major player in the}} country's agriculture and <b>wine</b> <b>industry.</b> In all, the Bay Area is home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, second only to the New York metropolitan area, with thirty such companies based throughout the region. In 2014, the greater twelve-county statistical area had a GDP of $758.5 billion, the third-highest among combined statistical areas. The smaller nine-county Bay Area had a GDP of $721 billion, which nonetheless would rank it 6th among U.S. states and 16th among countries.|$|E
