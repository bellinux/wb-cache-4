5|$|Bruce {{appointed}} Thomas Robertson as Scotias captain. Robertson was {{an experienced}} Antarctic and Arctic sailor who had commanded the <b>whaling</b> ship Active on the Dundee <b>Whaling</b> Expedition. The {{rest of the}} 25officers and men, who signed for three-year engagements, were all Scotsmen, many used to sailing in icy waters on <b>whaling</b> voyages.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>whaling</b> {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat <b>whaling,</b> employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern <b>whaling</b> activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm <b>whaling</b> increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, <b>whaling</b> continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|The Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS) {{was adopted}} {{alongside}} ACCOBAMS {{to establish a}} special protection area for Europe's increasingly threatened cetaceans. Other anti-whaling efforts include a ten-year moratorium in 1986 by the IWC on all <b>whaling,</b> and an environmental agreement (a type of international law) the International Convention for the Regulation of <b>Whaling</b> which controlled commercial, scientific, and subsistence <b>whaling.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both <b>whaling</b> and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if <b>whaling</b> is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the <b>whaling</b> industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the <b>whaling</b> industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{continue}} to be harvested. However, only three nations take whales: Iceland, Norway, and Japan. All these nations {{are part of the}} IWC, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the moratorium and continuing commercial <b>whaling.</b> Japan, being part of the IWC, whales under the Scientific Permit stated in Article VIII in the Convention for the Regulation of <b>Whaling,</b> which allows the taking of whales for scientific research. Japan has had two main research programs: the Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) and the Japanese Research Program in the North (JARPN). JARPN is focused in the North Pacific and JARPA around the Antarctic. JARPA mainly caught Antarctic minke whales, catching nearly 7,000; to a far lesser extent, they also caught fin whales. Animal-rights activist groups, such as the Greenpeace, object to Japan's scientific <b>whaling,</b> with some calling it a substitute for commercial <b>whaling.</b> In 2014, the International Court of Justice (the UN judicial branch) banned the taking of whales for any purpose in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary; however, Japan refuses to stop <b>whaling</b> and has only promised to cut their annual catches by a third (around 300 whales per year).|$|E
5|$|In December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale {{appeared in the}} Firth of Tay off the shore of Dundee, at that time Scotland's major <b>whaling</b> port, and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the <b>whaling</b> boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that the historic worldwide population numbered 1,100,000 before commercial sperm <b>whaling</b> {{began in the early}} eighteenth century. By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent. From that date until 1946, the population appears to have partially recovered as <b>whaling</b> activity decreased, and after World War II, the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre-whaling population. Between 184,000 and 236,000 sperm whales were killed by the various <b>whaling</b> nations in the nineteenth century, while in the twentieth century, at least 770,000 were taken, the majority between 1946 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} <b>whaling,</b> great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern <b>whaling</b> techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered <b>whaling</b> had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Whaling</b> Commission (IWC) {{issued a}} {{moratorium}} on commercial hunting of this whale, although Iceland and Costa Rica have resumed hunting. The species is also hunted by Greenlanders under the IWC's Aboriginal Subsistence <b>Whaling</b> provisions. Global population estimates range from less than 100,000 to roughly 119,000.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships <b>whaling</b> on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union <b>whaling</b> fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American <b>whaling</b> fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} {{subsequently}} visited by many government and <b>whaling</b> ships sailing between New South Wales and Norfolk Island {{and across the}} Pacific, including many from the American <b>whaling</b> fleet, so its reputation as a provisioning port preceded settlement, some ships leaving goats and pigs on the island as food for future visitors. Between July and October 1791 the Third Fleet ships arrived at Sydney and within days the deckwork was being reconstructed for a future in the lucrative <b>whaling</b> industry. Whale oil was to become Australia's most profitable export until the 1830s, {{and it was the}} <b>whaling</b> industry that shaped Lord Howe Island's early history.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial <b>whaling</b> stations, although this source dried up after the International <b>Whaling</b> Commission implemented a global ban on commercial <b>whaling</b> in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E
5|$|Various {{non-governmental}} organizations participate in marine conservation activism, wherein they {{draw attention to}} and aid in various problems in marine conservation, such as pollution, <b>whaling,</b> bycatch, and so forth. Notable organizations include the Greenpeace who focus on overfishing and <b>whaling</b> among other things, and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society who are known for taking direct-action tactics to expose illegal activity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{commercial}} <b>whaling</b> does {{still take}} place in Icelandic waters today, dolphins are no longer hunted and whale watching is popular amongst tourists.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and <b>whaling.</b> His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a <b>whaling</b> ship. One night, the two boys become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning <b>whaling</b> ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right <b>whaling</b> in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right whales in the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal <b>whaling</b> continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale hunting {{was banned}} in 1966 by the International <b>Whaling</b> Commission, and illegal <b>whaling</b> by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s, {{by which time}} 330,000 blue whales had {{been caught in the}} Antarctic, 33,000 {{in the rest of the}} Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest {{original}} population, in the Antarctic, had been reduced to a mere 360 individuals, about 0.15% of their initial numbers.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several <b>whaling</b> stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last <b>whaling</b> station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1794, Acors Barns {{was the son}} a mariner {{and lived}} in Westerly, Rhode Island before moving to Stonington, Connecticut. Barns moved to New London, Connecticut and formed a <b>whaling</b> company with William Williams Jr. in 1827. The company prospered {{and became one of}} the largest firms in the city, but Barns avoided the 1849 decline of the <b>whaling</b> {{industry}} by investing elsewhere. Barns invested in the Willimantic and Palmer Railroad before establishing the Bank of Commerce in 1852. Barns died in 1862, but his sons would continue the successful Bank of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|Citizens of New Bedford became {{interested}} in preserving and protecting {{the remnants of the}} city's <b>whaling</b> past. They formed the Waterfront Historic Area League (WHALE) in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Commercial <b>whaling</b> was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. <b>Whaling</b> {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American <b>whaling</b> industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International <b>Whaling</b> Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Commercial <b>whaling</b> was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International <b>Whaling</b> Commission placed a moratorium which banned <b>whaling</b> for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to <b>whaling,</b> making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} scene, the show also draws {{parallel}} between Japanese <b>whaling</b> industry and generally accepted {{meat and poultry}} industries.|$|E
5|$|New England <b>whaling</b> ships hunting {{sperm whales}} in the Pacific began {{to arrive in}} Hawaii in 1819, and many ships {{anchored}} in Honolulu and Lahaina. The impact of the <b>whaling</b> fleets on the Hawaiian Islands {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III (1825–1854) shaped the entire Hawaiian economy and was the primary source of income for the islands until the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859 and the onset of the American Civil War (1861–1865).|$|E
5|$|Renamed Kings-town upon Hull by King Edward I in 1299, Hull {{has been}} a market town, {{military}} supply port, trading hub, fishing and <b>whaling</b> centre and industrial metropolis.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the <b>whaling</b> ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet <b>whaling,</b> but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels. Recovery varies regionally, and the Eastern North Pacific blue whale population (historically a relatively small proportion of the global total) has rebounded to about 2,200 individuals, an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the zoological society's {{connection}} with the Salvesen family, some of the zoo's first animals were three king penguins, arriving from South Georgia with a Christian Salvesen <b>whaling</b> expedition that docked in Leith in early 1914. They were the first penguins to be seen {{anywhere in the world}} outside of the South Atlantic. The zoo successfully hatched the first ever captive king penguin chick in 1919. Penguins continued to arrive with <b>whaling</b> ships for years afterwards. Today, king penguins are perhaps the zoo's most famous animals.|$|E
5|$|The English and Dutch {{partitioned}} {{the island}} in 1614, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a <b>whaling</b> cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand {{and was able to}} dominate the <b>whaling</b> and fend off the English. The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and there were {{only a limited number of}} aggressive incidents. By the end of the 18th century, <b>whaling</b> had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction.|$|E
5|$|The English claimed {{sovereignty}} {{based on}} the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English who had started <b>whaling.</b> The Netherlands stated that <b>whaling</b> could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum. Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius—a land without a government.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whaling</b> {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, {{and the impact of}} the Civil War, ensured that it would not recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The <b>whaling</b> museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last <b>whaling</b> voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E
5|$|While {{owned by}} Weston, the brig Smyrna, {{launched}} in 1825, {{was the first}} United States vessel to enter the Black Sea under a special permit from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The ship Lagoda, launched in 1826 and sold by Weston to a <b>whaling</b> merchant, {{became one of the}} most successful in the New Bedford, Massachusetts <b>whaling</b> fleet. A half-scale model of the Lagoda is today featured in the New Bedford <b>Whaling</b> Museum. The brig Messenger, launched in 1834, was also sold to a <b>whaling</b> merchant and, in 1862, became part of the infamous Stone Fleet sunk in Charleston Harbor by the United States Navy in hopes of obstructing the Confederate port during the Civil War. The ship Oneco, Weston's second largest vessel launched in 1839 became the only Weston ship to circumnavigate the globe from 1850–1852. The ship Hope, launched in 1841, was at the time the largest merchant vessel built in New England and on her maiden voyage shipped a record-breaking cargo of cotton from New Orleans to Liverpool, England.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} of the <b>whaling</b> {{industry}} and the California Gold Rush, in the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and infectious disease epidemics contributed to the loss of local populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on <b>whaling</b> set {{under the terms}} of the International <b>Whaling</b> Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, King Kamehameha IV declared the Kingdom of Hawaii's neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons for joining the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included the unemployed sailors on <b>whaling</b> ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on <b>whaling</b> ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the CSS Shenandoah. There was also an ideological sympathy for the cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through missionaries and the <b>whaling</b> industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to slavery.|$|E
5|$|Following {{large-scale}} commercial <b>whaling</b> {{during the}} late 19th and 20th centuries, when over 255,000 whales were taken, the sei whale is now internationally protected, although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian route. In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route. In 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a <b>whaling</b> factory ship. She served with the Norwegian <b>whaling</b> fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E
