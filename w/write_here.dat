2500|$|Because Variações did {{not have}} the {{knowledge}} to properly compose music by himself, collaboration with other musicians at the writing, recording and producing stages was necessary. He would first collaborate with the musicians Vítor Rua, Tóli César Machado (both from the band GNR) and José Moz Carrapa on his first LP, [...] "Anjo da Guarda", and then with Pedro Ayres Magalhães and Carlos Maria Trindade, at the time, part of the band Heróis do Mar (and later, Madredeus) on the recording of [...] "Dar & Receber". The five members of Heróis do Mar acted as António's studio band; they would become close to Variações, especially Pedro Ayres Magalhães, who speaks fondly of him on the liner notes of [...] "Dar & Receber": [...] "I thank you António, for your enthusiasm and trust, and I would like to <b>write</b> <b>here</b> that I've gained a friendship".|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the diverse}} {{accounts}} in Tovarășe de drum, Burța-Cernat singles out those of Babeți, who recalls the importance tote bags had {{for her family}} during two decades of communism, and Bittel, who speaks about the ideal female cook, as [...] "the queen of sarmale". She is however critical {{of the fact that}} such a contribution was initiated by men, arguing that this impinges on its merits: [...] "given {{the way in which they}} <b>write</b> <b>here,</b> the ladies invited to partake in this collective project leave the impression that they are striving to fall in line with the rules of a game, [...] to confirm [...] the already consolidated idea about them: the idea of difference—much too essentialist (and it is biological essentialism that is involved here)—, the idea that [...] they see the world, politics included, different from humanity's masculine majority." [...] As part of this comment, she also argues that the book is excessively indebted to concrete economic aspects which women found especially challenging, whereas the [...] "generically human" [...] intellectual needs are [...] "placed in brackets". Chivu, who saw the work as fluctuating between the seriousness of Ruști's account and Babeți's humorous recollection, believed Simona Popescu's contribution, which describes communist experience as [...] "laughing out of pity", to be [...] "the most balanced". In reference to the entire text, and in particular accounts of the ban on abortion, he argues: [...] "all [...] female authors fundamentally speak about the same thing: the torment of being a woman, between the frustration of having one's intimacy forbidden and the efforts of illicit femininity." [...] Babeți's account was also viewed with interest by journalist Florentina Ciuverca, who also drew attention to Ruști's story about how, despite the official campaign against abortion, a doctor preemptively subjected her to curettage over a case of vaginal bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} 101 Albums that Changed Popular Music (2009), Pet Sounds is {{evaluated}} as [...] "one {{of the most}} innovative recordings in rock"; that it [...] "elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius". Dominique Leone wrote a 9.4 review of its 40th Anniversary edition for Pitchfork stating: [...] "Certainly, regardless of what I <b>write</b> <b>here,</b> the impact and 'influence' of the record will have been in turn hardly influenced at all. I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore.... The hymnal aspect {{of many of these}} songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction." [...] Music journalist Robert Christgau felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a [...] Composer Atticus Ross explains that the album has [...] "an element of cliché that's grown around it". He references a sketch from the television show Portlandia in which [...] "your classic hipster musicians... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.' This is exactly the same as Pet Sounds.'" [...] Commentator C.W. Maloney mused: [...] "The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you have to wonder, given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, what we mean when we call it a classic or Wilson a genius. Consider what [...] Zappa was doing in 1966, to say nothing of Miles [...] Wilson's high reputation is evidence of our obsession with childlike innocence and the victory of boring poptimism." ...|$|E
