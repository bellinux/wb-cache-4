5000|$|In 2010, while {{discussing}} {{about who}} might play {{the lead role}} of Eilis, Saoirse Ronan, who was just 16 years old {{at that time and}} played teenage roles in films, was on the shortlist. According to Crowley, however, there never was anybody else he had in mind to play Eilis other than Ronan, whom he knew from Atonement (2007). Instead, the part was offered to Rooney Mara. However, since it took the next two years to find a director, Mara had to leave the project after accepting the role of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. After Rooney's departure, the role was then offered to Ronan who was 19 years old. Ronan at that time was facing a situation similar to that of her character Eilis; she had just moved from Dublin to her own place in London to pursue career opportunities two months before filming began. When she first mentioned the decision to move to London to Crowley, he encouraged her, thinking it might put her in the right mood for the part. It later indeed aided in her acting for she felt homesick, [...] "I had no idea the relevance the story would take on for me. It was the first time I've played someone whose emotional state was so similar to mine." [...] Remarkably, her parents had also moved to New York City during the 1980s in search of jobs after a really bad recession struck Ireland. Brooklyn marks the first time Ronan is playing a lead role as an Irishwoman, which she said upped the pressure to play the part exactly right, and the second time she used her Irish accent, following The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). According to Ronan, the film is about choice, about <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> enough life experience to make a choice for yourself. Crowley describes the emotions that Ronan brought to the set as [...] "incredibly raw." [...] Sometimes, the director says the actress would ask him if she was doing enough because she was so much into the character.|$|R

5000|$|Critics {{say that}} Red Dirt {{can best be}} likened to the indie genre of rock 'n' roll {{as there is no}} {{definitive}} sound that can be attributed to all the bands in the movement. Most Red Dirt artists would be classified by the music industry as Americana, folk, or alt-country, though the range of sounds in the Red Dirt spectrum goes beyond these genres. It {{has been described as a}} mix of folk, rock, country, bluegrass, blues, Western swing, and honky tonk, with even a few Mexican influences. Singer-songwriter and former Stillwater resident Jimmy LaFave said,"It's kind of hard to put into words, but if you ever drive down on the (Mississippi) Delta, you can almost hear that blues sound," [...] he explains. [...] "Go to New Orleans, and you can almost hear the Dixieland jazz. Go to San Francisco, and you get that psychedelic-music vibe. You hear the Red Dirt sound <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> Stillwater. It has to do with the spirit of the people. There's something different about them. They're not Texans, they're Okies, and I think the whole Red Dirt sound is just as important to American musicology as the San Francisco Sound or any of the rest. It's distinctly its own thing." ...|$|E

There were 175,000 votes overall that were so-called “spoiled ballots.” About two-thirds of the spoiled ballots were over-votes; many or most of them would have been write-in over-votes, where people had punched and written in a candidate’s name. And nobody looked at this, not even the Florida Supreme Court in the last decision it made requiring a statewide recount. Nobody had thought about it except Judge Terry Lewis, who was overseeing the statewide recount when it was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court. The write-in over-votes have really not gotten much attention. Those votes are not ambiguous.
