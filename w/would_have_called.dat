They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} Surekill and inquire {{as to the}} company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he {{responds}} that he did. Doggett asks why Chase <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Surekill just before his death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of her desk, but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to her surprise. Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|In June 1941, German and Italian {{consulates}} were closed, {{and there}} were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well.

25|$|Negotiations {{to find a}} {{solution}} to the Cyprus problem have been taking place on and off since 1964. Between 1974 and 2002, the Turkish Cypriot side was seen by the international community as the side refusing a balanced solution. Since 2002, the situation has been reversed according to US and UK officials, and the Greek Cypriot side rejected a plan which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus without guarantees that the Turkish occupation forces would be removed. The latest Annan Plan to reunify the island which was endorsed by the United States, United Kingdom and Turkey was accepted by a referendum by Turkish Cypriots but overwhelmingly rejected in parallel referendum by Greek Cypriots, after the Greek Cypriot Leadership and Greek Orthodox Church urged the Greek population to vote No.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at her throat and press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E

25|$|Recent archaeological {{work at the}} {{battlefield}} indicates that officers on Custer Hill restored some tactical control. E Company rushed off Custer Hill toward the Little Bighorn River but failed, which resulted in total destruction, leaving behind some 50 to 60 men. The remainder of the battle took {{on the nature of}} a running fight. Modern archaeology and historical Indian accounts indicate that Custer's force may have been divided into three groups, with the Indians' attempting to prevent them from effectively reuniting. Indian accounts describe warriors (including women) running up from the village to wave blankets in order to scare off the soldiers' horses. One 7th Cavalry trooper claimed finding a number of stone mallets consisting of a round cobble weighing 8–10 pounds (about 4kg) with a rawhide handle, which he believed had been used by the Indian women to finish off the wounded. Fighting dismounted, the soldiers' skirmish lines were overwhelmed. Army doctrine <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> for one man in four to be a horseholder behind the skirmish lines and, in extreme cases, one man in eight. Later, the troops would have bunched together in defensive positions and are alleged to have shot their remaining horses as cover. As individual troopers were wounded or killed, initial defensive positions would have been abandoned as untenable.|$|E

500|$|While in {{the past}} this regnal year date was assumed to refer to Ahmose, it is today {{believed}} instead to refer to Ahmose's Hyksos opponent Khamudi since the Rhind papyrus document refers to Ahmose by the inferior title of 'Prince of the South' rather than king or pharaoh, as a Theban supporter of Ahmose surely <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> him. Anthony Spalinger, in a JNES 60 (2001) book review of Kim Ryholt's 1997 book, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800–1550 BC, notes that Ryholt's translation of the middle portion of the Rhind text chronicling Ahmose's invasion of the Delta reads instead as the [...] "1st month of Akhet, 23rd day.

500|$|Following the Åsta {{accident}} on 4 January 2000, when a Class 92 was wrecked and {{taken out of}} service, NSB announced that they would terminate two of the commuter rail services south of Støren towards Oppdal.

From 11 June 2000, all services on the Dovre Line south of Støren were terminated, leaving only intercity services. At the same year, plans by local politicians and commerce were launched to halve the travel time between Trondheim and Steinkjer, under the motto [...] "Trondheim to Steinkjer in one hour". NSB hoped to introduce a faster airport link, similar to the Airport Express Train in Oslo, which would allow the trains to operate from Trondheim to the airport in 20 minutes.

500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm.

When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was {{the sort of person who}} might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E

The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question".

500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of the Silence, and a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures of the little girl from the space suit. The girl enters with the Silence, and Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes in his recent adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>called</b> the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should kill us all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E
