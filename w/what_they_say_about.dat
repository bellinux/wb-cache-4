[...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't care <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the production. I should care if they said nothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the advent}} of a regular {{television}} service in the Federal Republic in 1952, cinema attendances continued to grow through much of the 1950s, reaching a peak of 817.5 million visits in 1956. The majority of the films of this period set out to do no more than entertain the audience and had few pretensions to artistry or active engagement with social issues. The defining genre of the period was arguably the Heimatfilm ("homeland film"), in which morally simplistic tales of love and family were played out in a rural setting, often in the mountains of Bavaria, Austria or Switzerland. [...] In their day Heimatfilms were of little interest to more scholarly film critics, but in recent years they {{have been the subject of}} study in relation to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the culture of West Germany in the years of the Wirtschaftswunder. Other film genres typical of this period were adaptations of operettas, hospital melodramas, comedies and musicals. Many films were remakes of earlier Ufa productions.|$|E

2500|$|Back in 1947, Harrison [...] "mocked up a 'fact' {{magazine}} called Eyewitness," [...] which was never published. Then in 1952, Harrison {{spent six months}} reworking the format of a new, similar magazine. He would later say: [...] "I must have ripped that thing apart three times before I published it, and it still wasn't right." [...] Supposedly inspired by Virginia Hill's testimony to the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison launched his tabloid-style gossip magazine: Confidential. As with the earlier New York Graphic, it concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. For example, the magazine alleged that June Allyson had extramarital affairs ("How Long Can Dick Powell Take It?"), that Johnnie Ray was a [...] "drag queen" [...] (“Is It True <b>What</b> <b>They</b> <b>Say</b> <b>About</b> Johnnie Ray?") and that Robert Mitchum was an exhibitionist ("Robert Mitchum...the Nude Who came to Dinner!") Apart from spreading gossip, Confidential combined the exposés with a conservative agenda especially targeted at those who sympathized with the left wing and in identifying those engaged in [...] "miscegenation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Winchell's sponsorship, Howard Rushmore {{became the}} chief {{editor of a}} New York scandal magazine, Confidential. Its publisher, Robert Harrison, began as an office boy and later writer for Bernarr McFadden's New York Graphic during the 1920s, an {{ancestor}} of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. It was at the Graphic where the young Harrison first met Walter Winchell. As an adult Harrison was on the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald, a trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., had {{close ties to the}} Hays Office. Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. Supposedly inspired by the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison later launched a tabloid-style gossip magazine. It concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?" [...] Before Rushmore's tenure at Confidential, Harrison published stories like “Is It True <b>What</b> <b>They</b> <b>Say</b> <b>About</b> Johnnie Ray?" [...] and [...] "Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!" [...] With [...] "Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!", Harrison came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving [...] "racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes," [...] "exposés of star secrets" [...] became Confidentials prime focus.|$|E
