5|$|Affeldt {{improved}} with the GCL Royals the next year, going 43 with a 2.89 ERA in twelve games (nine starts). His performance even {{earned him a}} promotion to the single-A Lansing Lugnuts. Affeldt did not do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time with them, though, as he went 03 with a 9.53 ERA in six games (three starts).|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Canadian waters, Curtis became friends with Governor Molyneux Shuldham who became Curtis' patron and in 1775 {{assisted}} his transfer into HMS Chatham off New York City. The following year, with the American Revolutionary War underway, Curtis was promoted to commander and given the sloop HMS Senegal. Curtis performed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> new command {{and a year later}} was again promoted after being noticed by Lord Howe. Howe made Curtis captain of his own flagship HMS Eagle, and the men became close friends.|$|E
5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly because he was a capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry was anxious to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E

5|$|Reid named Vick the Eagles' {{starting}} quarterback on September 21 after Kolb suffered a concussion and Vick performed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stead. In his second game as an Eagles starter versus the Jacksonville Jaguars, Vick led the Eagles to a 28–3 win, throwing for 291 {{yards and three}} touchdowns and rushing for another touchdown. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September. Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in a week 4 game against the Redskins, and was replaced by Kolb. Vick had passed for 49yards with three carries for 17yards in the game prior to the injury.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez won {{his first}} major league start on September 6 (in place of Noah Lowry, who was injured), giving up one run in 5⅔ innings pitched in a 3–2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. After that, Sánchez {{replaced}} Brad Hennessey in the rotation. However, Sánchez did not pitch <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> last four appearances of the season (one came in relief), as he had an 11.36 ERA in them.|$|E
5|$|Berger and {{his family}} settled in Southport, Merseyside, where they resided near retired players Kenny Dalglish and Alan Hansen. Debuting as a {{substitute}} in a 2–1 home win against Southampton on 7 September 1996, Berger performed <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first month with the club, endearing him to supporters and earning praise from colleagues. In his second match, he replaced Stan Collymore as half time substitute, going on to score two goals in a 3–0 win against Leicester City. A second double was registered against Chelsea in the latter's 5–1 defeat at Anfield, which he followed with a fifth goal in four games in a Cup Winners' Cup match against MYPA. The series of displays were recognised in October 1996 with the FA's Player of the Month award for September.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5|$|Devers {{graduated}} from York High School in May 1905. He applied to, and was accepted by, Lehigh University, {{with the intention}} of studying engineering, but then Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. He entered the Academy in June with the class of 1909. Among his classmates were George S. Patton, William Hood Simpson, and Robert L. Eichelberger, who would also become four-star generals in World War II, and John C. H. Lee, who would become a three-star general. He did <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> studies, and excelled in sports, playing shortstop on the Army baseball team and guard on the Army Black Knights' basketball squad. He also played polo. He {{graduated from}} West Point on 11 June 1909, ranking 39th in his class of 103, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in his chosen branch: the field artillery. There were only nine positions available, but enough of the higher-ranking cadets chose other branches for Devers to secure his first preference.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{went through}} knee surgery during the offseason, {{but there was}} still concern about whether he had a future in the NFL. That was set aside when he was {{considered}} to be progressing <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> recovery as of early July 1977. During the Buccaneers' offseason, the quarterbacks on the roster changed entirely, with Dickinson being the only holdover; Gary Huff was now the starter, and Dickinson was fighting for a backup role alongside Mike Boryla and Randy Hedberg. After the Buccaneers lost Boryla and Huff to injuries, the former for the season, Dickinson ended up being the starting quarterback for the team's final preseason game against the Bills. In the game, Dickinson completed 2 of 12 passes for -2yards and was sacked three times in a 176 loss. A week after the game against the Bills, Dickinson was released by the Buccaneers along with four other players. The Buccaneers re-signed him after Huff got injured in late October, but Dickinson was again released a couple weeks later.|$|E

At every match, he follows Moe's advice and gains widespread attention, eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association. Moe's former boxing manager Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight, and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer. Lucius hopes that due to Homer's fame as a human punching bag, he will at least be able to endure a few rounds. Moe, despite knowing that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E

5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
