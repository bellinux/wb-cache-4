500|$|A. I {{would like}} to say the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings. As Poliakov says, in Poliakov - Black or Red - I can give the page number right away...I have it in my files somewhere...he reproduces forms. On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E

[...] The name of the song was used as the title of Hank Williams' 1964 biopic. [...] "Your Cheatin' Heart", as well as other songs by Williams were performed on the movie, with George Hamilton dubbing the soundtrack album recorded by Williams' son, Hank Williams, Jr. [...] In the 2003 documentary series Lost Highway, country music historian Ronnie Pugh comments, [...] "It's Hank's anthem, it's his musical last will and testament. [...] It's searing, it's powerful, it's gripping. [...] If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is his last and best work, I wouldn't argue with that." [...] AllMusic described the track as the [...] "signature song" [...] of Hank Williams, and an [...] "unofficial anthem" [...] of country music. Rolling Stone called it [...] "one of the greatest country standards of all time", ranking it at number 217 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

2500|$|We've {{seen here}} at the city of Kent especially, {{probably}} the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups.

60|$|And now, in {{a cooler}} moment, I hasten to blab the whole {{simplicity}} of it, to blab on Roscoe {{and the other}} navigators {{and the rest of}} the priesthood, all for fear that I may become even as they, secretive, immodest, and inflated with self-esteem. And I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> now: any young fellow with ordinary gray matter, ordinary education, and with the slightest trace of the student-mind, can get the books, and charts, and instruments and teach himself navigation. Now I must not be misunderstood. Seamanship is an entirely different matter. It is not learned in a day, nor in many days; it requires years. Also, navigating by dead reckoning requires long study and practice. But navigating by observations of the sun, moon, and stars, thanks to the astronomers and mathematicians, is child's play. Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week. And yet again I must not be misunderstood. I do not mean to say that at the end of a week a young fellow could take charge of a fifteen-thousand-ton steamer, driving twenty knots an hour through the brine, racing from land to land, fair weather and foul, clear sky or cloudy, steering by degrees on the compass card and making landfalls with most amazing precision. But what I do mean is just this: the average young fellow I have described can get into a staunch sail-boat and put out across the ocean, without knowing anything about navigation, and at the end of the week he will know enough to know where he is on the chart. He will be able to take a meridian observation with fair accuracy, and from that observation, with ten minutes of figuring, work out his latitude and longitude. And, carrying neither freight nor passengers, being under no press to reach his destination, he can jog comfortably along, and if at any time he doubts his own navigation and fears an imminent landfall, he can heave to all night and proceed in the morning.|$|E
