40|$|The {{rhythms of}} war and popular culture intermingle, amplify each other and become expressive. At {{the leading edge of}} the US military’s war machine assemblage, as the nation of Iraq is deterritorialised from the despotic {{signifier}} ‘Saddam Hussein’, the soldiers’ music consolidates a milieu of the battlefield. It also consolidates a space-time of the here-now with something less horrific. The popular music refrain produces a home away from home. In their patriotism, many of these singer–soldiers see a religious act. <b>When</b> <b>someone</b> is <b>saying</b> ‘God is on our side’ they are no longer talking about the nation-based context for which, whatever the rules of war might be, such rules are relevant.

2500|$|The Dutch {{habit of}} naming newborns after another family member {{originates}} with a then-widespread superstition {{that the name}} in some way contributed {{to some form of}} reincarnation of the person the child was named after, who was usually much older.

40|$|Who {{owns the}} sky? For most of history, people never {{actually}} visited the sky, but {{the common law}} nonetheless had an answer: “cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum”—he who owns the soil owns up to the sky. This rule worked well enough for centuries because it only came up <b>when,</b> <b>say,</b> <b>someone</b> built a structure or owned a tree that overhung someone else’s land, or <b>when</b> <b>someone</b> provocatively held his arm over his neighbor’s fence.

5000|$|Data {{identification}} {{is the process}} of identifying the subsets of available data to focus on for analysis. The data by itself is useless unless it's interpreted, once we start analyzing the data it begins to become useful as it conveys a message. Any data that conveys a meaningful message becomes information. On a high level, unprocessed data takes the following forms to translate into exact message: noisy data; relevant and irrelevant data, filtered data; only relevant data, information; data that conveys a vague message, knowledge; data that conveys a precise message, wisdom; data that conveys exact message and reason behind it. To derive wisdom from an unprocessed data, we need to start processing it, refine the dataset by including data that we want to focus on, and organize data to identify information. In the context of social media analytics, data identification means [...] "what" [...] content are we interested in, in addition to the text of content, we want to know: who wrote the text? Where was it found or on which social media venue did it appear? Are we interested in information from a specific locale? <b>When</b> did <b>someone</b> <b>say</b> something in social media? ...|$|R
