This study aimed to assess the water quality of Nimbai stream using benthos macroinvertebrates tolerance level and several water quality parameters. Data retrieval was conducted in JuneJuly and SeptemberOctober 2012 in seven stations (L 1 L 7) from Nimbai upstream to downstream that connected to Prafi river. The water macroinvertebrates were taken using surber with mesh size 200 μm and then was identified at the family level. At L 5 station near the oil palm <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>installations</b> was contains oil and fat (< 1 - 3 mg/l), which resulted in dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH is lower than the other stations. Similarly the value of H' is low (0. 83), however, the value of C (0. 79) was high that dominated by Oligochaeta. Famili biotic index (FBI) value obtained showed that water quality in the L 1 L 4 stations was in good to excellent condition, but the quality at L 5 station is classified as very poor. As the distance far away from the sources of pollution in the L 5 station, water quality tends to improve as shown in the L 6 and L 7 stations.

The aim of the present work is to develop a constitutive model that is able to describe the behaviour of compacted expansive clays under these coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical actions. The proposed model is based on two existing models: one for the hydro-mechanical behaviour of compacted expansive clays and another for the thermo-mechanical behaviour of saturated clays. The elaborated model has been validated using the thermo-hydro-mechanical test results on the compacted MX 80 bentonite. Comparison between the model prediction and the experimental data show that this model is able to reproduce the main features of volume changes: heating at constant suction and pressure induces either expansion or contraction; the mean yield stress changes with variations of suction or temperature...|$|R

Solid <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> has been identified as a major environmental threat to First Nations Communities. A community-based participatory research project (CBPR) was initiated by the Saskatoon Tribal Council Health and Family Services Incorporated to investigate concerns related to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> in three Saskatchewan First Nations Communities. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we aimed to gain an understanding of past and present <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices and to identify any human and environmental health concerns related to these practices. One to one interviews and sharing circles were conducted with Elders. Elders were asked to share their perspectives on past and present <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices and to comment on the possible impacts these practices may have on the environment and community health. Historically <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices were similar among communities. The homeowner generated small volumes of waste, was exclusively responsible for disposal and utilized a backyard pit. Overtime <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> evolved to weekly pick-up of un-segregated garbage with <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> and open trash burning in a community dump site. Dump site locations and open trash burning were identified as significant health issues related to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices in these communities. This research raises issues of inequity in the management of waste in First Nations Communities. It highlights the need for long-term sustainable funding to support community-based <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> and management strategies and the development of First Nations centered and delivered educational programs to encourage the adoption and implementation of waste reduction, reutilization and recycling activities in these communities...|$|R

As the results, there are environmental pollution such as unpleasant odor, leachate and uncontrolled littering activities. Because of the pollution, {{the perception of the}} society around to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> is bad and conflict between the societies around the location and the sweepers arises.
