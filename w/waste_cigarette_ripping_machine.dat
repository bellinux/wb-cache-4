40|$|This thesis gives a {{detailed}} description of Zlil Sela’s construction of Makanin-Razborov diagrams which describe Hom(G, T), the set of all homomorphisms from G to T, where G is a finitely generated group and T is a hyperbolic group. Moreover, while Sela’s construction requires T to be torsion-free, this thesis removes this condition and addresses the case of arbitrary hyperbolic groups. Sela’s shortening argument, which is the main tool {{in the construction of the}} Makanin- Razborov diagrams, relies on the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine,</b> a structure theorem for finitely generated groups acting stably on real trees. As homomorphisms from a f. g. group G to a hyperbolic group T give rise to stable actions of G on real trees, which appear topologically as limits of the G-actions on the Cayley graph of T, the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> and the shortening argument allow us to explore the structure of Hom(G, T) and construct Makanin-Razborov diagrams which encode all homomorphisms from G to T. While Sela’s version of the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> allows the formulation of the shortening argument only in the case where T is torsion-free, Guirardel has presented a generalized version of the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine,</b> which we exploit to generalize the shortening argument and the construction of Makanin-Razborov diagrams to the case of arbitrary hyperbolic groups.

30|$|A burning {{cigarette}} is a {{known cause}} of fire when mishandled. Studies into cigarette ignition propensity intensified after the US Cigarette Fire Safety Act of 1984. Extensive research has investigated the thermal properties of a smouldering cigarette, mostly {{away from any}} object of thermal contact or interference. To understand fire ignition, the thermophysics of cigarette’s burning tip has also been examined with and without a contact substrate. In either free or contact smouldering cases, oxygen diffusion through the cigarette wrapping paper {{has been found to}} be an important parameter controlling the rate of burn and the energy released. Research by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology led to a standardized test method to determine cigarette ignition propensity, and eventually regulations enforcing Reduced Ignition Propensity (<b>RIP)</b> <b>cigarettes</b> have been passed in all US states and other countries. Among the physical parameters of a burning cigarette related to its thermal energy release, circumferential bands applied to the cigarette wrapping paper that reduce air permeability or diffusivity during smouldering have become the main approach to produce commercial <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Studies have been performed to ensure that <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> have equivalent or lower mainstream smoke yields and biological activities as compared with their conventional non-RIP equivalents. The effects of the paper band properties (width, gap between the bands, type as well as the amount of the material applied) have been studied systematically to establish a manufacturability window. Studies on human smoking behaviour confirmed that <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> matched closely their predecessors. The bands, as intended, alter the combustion temperatures during cigarette smouldering within the band. Further research into the interaction of <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> with different types of commercial upholstery fabrics and materials should help to understand its mechanism of action in support of emerging post-implementation fire statistics.|$|R

30|$|As a {{simplified}} standard method, the ASTM 2187 {{should not be}} taken as the end-all solution to solve cigarette related fire risks. To address a smouldering cigarette as a fire source and upholstery material as an ignition target, current research proves that controlling oxygen diffusion into the burning coal is effective and directly related to the reduction of its heat influx to the surrounding environment. Extensive body of work has been done to establish a design window for a burning cigarette from sensory, smoke chemistry and smoke biological activity point of view, but still deliver reduced heat flux once in contact with a substrate. This technical approach {{does not take into account}} of the substrate’s composition and physical shape, both of which have proved to influence the fire initiation to a significant extent. With commercial <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> currently sold in many jurisdictions implementing the RIP regulations, early fire statistical data give a mixed picture on the effectiveness of the <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in reducing real-life fire incidence, from up to 40 % of reduction in fire incidence to no significant effect.

Fundamental research into the thermal physical interaction between <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and different substrate materials is still required to understand the effectiveness or the lack of it. The research outcome should also help to explore whether improved or alternative technology may become available. With smouldering cigarette – substrate systems sufficiently characterised, it is feasible that computer modelling may be deployed to simulate main fire initiation probabilities and highlight further opportunities to manage this risk. Regulators and fire prevention initiatives should continue their proven effective measures such as fire hazard education, fire alarm installation, fire escape route planning, etc, in addition to the implementation of <b>RIP</b> <b>cigarette</b> regulation.|$|R

In {{the light of the}} Ending lamination theorem, it suffices to prove that any collection of possible ending invariants is realized by some algebraic limit of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds.

To any set of ending invariants we associate a sequence of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds and prove that this sequence has a convergent subsequence. We derive the necessary compactness theorem combining the <b>Rips</b> <b>machine</b> with non-existence results for certain small actions on real trees of free products of surface groups and free groups.

Results from a study on recycling cigarette butts into fired clay bricks are presented. Five different soil-cigarette butts mixes with different percentages of cigarette butts were used. The physico-mechanical properties of manufactured bricks including compressive strength, flexural strength, density, water absorption and thermal conductivity are discussed. The {{results show that the}} density of fired bricks was reduced significantly, by up to 30 %, depending on the percentage of cigarette butts incorporated into the raw materials.

The results also show that the mixing time has a considerable effect on the properties of the fired clay bricks tested. Furthermore, the leachate test results revealed only trace amounts of heavy metals. It was concluded that cigarette butts can be regarded as a potential addition to the raw materials used in the manufacture of lightweight fired bricks and, furthermore, that recycling cigarette butts in bricks is a very practical and potentially significant contribution in terms of a sustainable solution to one of the serious environmental pollution problems in the world...|$|R

Group actions on real trees arise naturally in several contexts in geometric topology: for example as boundary points of the Teichmüller space (every point in the Thurston boundary of the Teichmüller space is represented by a measured geodesic lamination on the surface; this lamination lifts to the universal cover of the surface and a naturally dual object to that lift is an -tree endowed with an isometric action of the fundamental group of the surface), as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of, appropriately rescaled, Kleinian group actions, and so on. The use of -trees machinery provides substantial shortcuts in modern proofs of Thurston's Hyperbolization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds. Similarly, -trees {{play a key role in}} the study of Culler-Vogtmann's Outer space as well as in other areas of geometric group theory; for example, asymptotic cones of groups often have a tree-like structure and give rise to group actions on real trees. The use of -trees, together with Bass-Serre theory, is a key tool in the work of Sela on solving the isomorphism problem for (torsion-free) word-hyperbolic groups, Sela's version of the JSJ-decomposition theory and the work of Sela on the Tarski Conjecture for free groups and the theory of limit groups.|$|R
