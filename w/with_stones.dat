5|$|Tipu then {{ordered the}} {{destruction}} of all 27 churches in Canara. According to oral tradition, the Idgah mosque in Mangalore was constructed <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> from the destroyed Milagres Church. Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses, offices, or homes for wealthy Muslims. A popular fortification in Mangalore, the Sultan Battery, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river, was constructed <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> taken from destroyed churches. The bells from the demolished churches eventually {{found their way into}} a number of temples in the area. After being informed of the impending roundup by a friend in Tipu's government, Fr. Joachim Miranda disbanded St. Joseph's Seminary and sent the seminarians to Verapoly, from where some proceeded to Goa while some joined the Augustinian order.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March, {{violence}} {{erupted in}} the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, barricading the streets with rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles <b>with</b> <b>stones.</b> Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents.|$|E
5|$|Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in {{the form}} of {{ceremonial}} axe representing clan's strength and power. These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou. The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> and shells. The axe is polished smooth like a disc. Carvings made of soapstone are also popular.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasid force met no {{resistance}} as they pillaged {{their way to}} the fortress. Once there, they began constructing siege engines and trying to fill its moat, but their progress was obstructed by the defenders’ own artillery. Then the Abbasids tried to launch a surprise night attack against a section of the fortress where there were no walls; the attack was repelled by the Byzantines, who hurled great logs, weighed <b>with</b> <b>stones,</b> against them.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{tomb of the}} princess: {{dating to}} c. 1800 BC, it is the oldest and {{smallest}} of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained {{the remains of a}} young woman, hence the naming. The dormos has steps, partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved <b>with</b> <b>stones,</b> leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.|$|E

5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats {{an idea about}} getting The Rolling Stones to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet <b>with</b> <b>Stones</b> manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E
5|$|The roads the Muisca {{merchants and}} xeques used to {{traverse}} the Altiplano and access surrounding areas, were dug {{in the top}} soil without pavement, making them hard to recognise in the archaeological record. The roads leading to the religious sites, such as Lake Tota, were marked <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> surrounding the pathway, which are still visible today. Cable bridges of vines and bamboo connected {{the banks of the}} many rivers of the Andes. The roads crossing the mountains of the Eastern Ranges were narrow, which created a problem for the Spanish conquistadors who used horses to travel long distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} and police worked {{to keep the}} mob at bay, and drove them {{to the far end}} of the station near Lee Street. There they assailed the buildings of the depot <b>with</b> <b>stones.</b> At 10:30pm the rioters set fire to passenger cars, the dispatcher's office, and the roundhouse. Some firefighters dispatched to the scene were driven off, and others had their hoses cut when they attempted to set up their pumps, but, under the protection of the police and soldiers, the flames were extinguished. The Sun reported the fires damaged one passenger car and engine, destroyed the dispatcher's office, and damaged the roof of the depot's shed. Two subsequent fires were started in the south of the city, but were dealt with without major damage.|$|E

5|$|Many Wielbark graves were flat, but kurgans {{are also}} {{characteristic}} and common. In {{the case of}} kurgans the grave was covered <b>with</b> <b>stones,</b> which were surrounded by a circle made of larger stones. More earth material was piled to cover all that, with a solitary stone, or stela often put on top. Such a kurgan could include one or several individual burials, have a diameter of up to {{a dozen or so}} meters and be up to one meter high. On some burial grounds large stone circles are found. These consist of massive boulders or rock pieces, up to 1.7 meters high, separated by several meters wide spaces, sometimes connected by smaller stones, the whole structure having a 10 to 40 meter diameter. In the middle of the circles one to four stelae were placed, and sometimes a single grave. The stone circles are believed to be the locations of meetings of Scandinavian (see below) tings - assemblies or courts. The single graves inside the circles are probably of people sacrificed and buried there - human offerings to the gods, to assure their support for the deliberations. A stone kurgans cemetery was found in Węsiory, Kartuzy County; another burial site with ten large stone circles was discovered in Odry, Chojnice County, both dated 2nd century AD.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} of the city was massacred during the sack; Theodosios writes that among the notables alone, over 4,000 were killed. The Arab commander, Abu Ishaq, had the commanding patrikios executed a week later, while the seventy men left with him along with other prisoners were reportedly taken out of the city and beaten to death <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> and clubs. One of the defenders, Niketas of Tarsos, who during the siege had insulted Muhammad daily, was taken apart and tortured to death. Only a few Mardaites from the Peloponnese along with some soldiers of the garrison were able to escape and, reaching Greece, inform admiral Adrianos of the events. The city itself was pillaged and practically destroyed. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Arabs remained there for about two months after the sack, before returning to their base, leaving the city in ruins. Ibn al-Athir also claims that a Byzantine squadron appeared before the city, but that it was driven off after a battle in which the Byzantines lost four ships.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{efforts to}} win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire {{declared}} war on September 9, 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on October 21, 1798. Egyptians armed <b>with</b> <b>stones,</b> spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon {{in an attempt to}} bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 3,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.|$|E

5|$|Sophia Dorothea had {{a second}} child, a {{daughter}} named after her, in 1687, {{but there were no}} other pregnancies. The couple became estranged—George preferred the company of his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Sophia Dorothea, meanwhile, had her own romance with the Swedish Count Philip Christoph von Königsmarck. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with the connivance of George, and his body thrown into the river Leine weighted <b>with</b> <b>stones.</b> The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom (Don Nicolò Montalbano) was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 thalers, which was about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest paid minister. Later rumours supposed that Königsmarck was hacked to pieces and buried beneath the Hanover palace floorboards. However, sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of Königsmarck's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled <b>with</b> <b>stones.</b> Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were drawn individually along rails on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|E

5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against the Wall and the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted <b>with</b> <b>stones</b> by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{involved}} over 2,500 {{people and}} among those present were incumbent parish priest John Barboza, Valerian Fernandes, Ajekar parish priest Valerian Fernandes, Attur parish priest Arthur Pereira, Miyar parish priest Ronald Miranda, Paschal Menezes, Parappady parish priest Alex Aranha, Michael D'Silva, Hirgan parish priest Michael Lobo, Kanajar parish priest Alwyn D'Cunha {{and many other}} priests and nuns in the area. The Christian protestors also clashed with police at St. Sebastian Church in the Permannur area of Ullal {{on the outskirts of}} Mangalore, shouting slogans and throwing stones at the police for their failure to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. The police arrested several Christians after firing into the air and being involved in a lathi charge. A witness in Permannur claimed that Christians attacked the houses of Hindus in retaliation, shouting slogans against the BJP government. Four people of pro-Hindu organisations were reportedly injured at Kalladka and Attavar {{on the outskirts of the}} Mangalore when their vehicles were attacked and were pelted <b>with</b> <b>stones.</b> Ten people, including one of the Sri Ram Sena activists, were reportedly stabbed during the protests and according to the police, the situation was used by some to settle personal scores and not all stabbing incidents were related to attack on churches and the subsequent violence in the city. The Sri Ram Sena protested against the stabbing of one of their activists by organising a shutdown of educational institutions and shops. The district administration responded by declaring a holiday for all educational institutions in Mangalore taluk, and extended prohibitory orders under the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code for two more days in the wake of the attacks and protests as a precaution.|$|E
