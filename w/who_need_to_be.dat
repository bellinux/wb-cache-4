25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awake at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E
500|$|Ganesha is Vighneshvara or Vighnaraja or Vighnaharta (Marathi), the Lord of Obstacles, both of a {{material}} and spiritual order. He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles, though traditionally he also places obstacles {{in the path}} of those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> checked. Paul Courtright says that [...] "his task in the divine scheme of things, his dharma, is to place and remove obstacles. It is his particular territory, the reason for his creation." ...|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{extends the}} {{distinction}} between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of holistic and prescriptive ones. This enables her to consider the social implications of how work is performed. She writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work. [...] "Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish." [...] Artisans may specialize in {{a particular kind of}} product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique. Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. [...] "Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> familiar only with the skills of performing that one step." ...|$|E

The spinoff, entitled [...] "All I Want for Christmas", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as [...] "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both at the moment. I reckon they're going to be one of those couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved. Poppy certainly hopes she's found her Prince Charming".|$|E
2500|$|Another main {{element of}} Sămănătoruls preoccupations was didacticism, twinned with calls for {{education}} reform: the magazine urged {{the education system}} to actively and primarily dedicate itself {{to the cause of}} peasants. This closely followed the National Liberal agenda, which had facilitated innovation in the field after 1898, and was in tune with the wide-ranging reforms pushed by Spiru Haret. In Veiga's account, the interest in educating the lower classes was partly owed to European precedents: the Jules Ferry laws in France and the Realschule system in the German Empire, as well as the efforts of Romanian Transylvanian teachers to compete with the officially-endorsed Hungarian-language institutions of learning. In parallel, the policy reflected Iorga's belief that spreading awareness of Romanian culture would cement the unity of Romanians {{on either side of the}} Carpathian Mountains. According to historian and comparatist Ștefan Borbély, an additional reflection of the group's educational theory was its encouragement of a [...] "public fantasy" [...] by depicting children as [...] "nasty" [...] human beings <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept in tight check.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be.

2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had a right to know about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E
2500|$|Advocates for women's {{issues have}} said that breast cancer is special because of {{its status as a}} largely female disease, society's {{response}} to it is an ongoing indication of the status of women and the existence of sexism. [...] Breast cancer activist Virginia Soffa wrote that [...] "s long as it is not a national priority, the breast cancer epidemic will remain a metaphor for how society treats women". Barbara Ehrenreich writes that, before the feminist movement [...] "medicine was a solid patriarchy," [...] and women with breast cancer were often treated as passive, dependent objects, incapable of making appropriate choices, whose role was to accept whatever treatment was decreed by the physicians and surgeons, who held all of the power. Because of sexism in education, female surgeons were far outnumbered by their male counterparts, and until the 1990s, when Susan Love of the University of California, Los Angeles Breast Center published Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, the physicians who provided breast cancer treatments were generally men. Love said that some male physicians tended to impose their own values on women, such as recommending mastectomy to older women because, being past the age of child bearing and breastfeeding, they no longer [...] "needed" [...] their breasts. The women's health movement promoted mutual aid, self-help, networking, and an active, informed role in the patient's health care. [...] Since the end of the breast cancer wars, feminists have again objected to the breast cancer culture's treatment of women with breast cancer as little girls <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obedient to authority figures, cooperative, pleasant and pretty.|$|E

60|$|This is {{a branch}} of {{correspondence}} which fully demands a volume alone {{to provide for the}} various phases incident to Love, Courtship and Marriage. Few persons, however otherwise fluent with the pen, are able to express in words the promptings of the first dawn of love, and even the ice once broken how to follow up a correspondence with the dearest one in the whole world and how to smooth the way with those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consulted in the matter. The numerous letters and answers in this book go far to overcome the difficulties and embarrassment inseparable from letters on this all-absorbing topic in all stages from beginning to end of a successful courtship, aided in many instances by the author's sensible comments on the specimen letters, and his valuable hints under adverse contingencies. It also contains the Art of Secret Writing, the Language of Love portrayed and rules in grammar.|$|E
