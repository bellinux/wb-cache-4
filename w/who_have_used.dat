In the past 20 or so years SGD have gained popularity amongst young children with speech deficiencies, such as autism, Down syndrome, and predicted brain damage due to surgery.|$|E
5|$|Other composers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> {{the organ}} {{prominently}} in orchestral music include Gustav Holst, Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Because these concert hall instruments could approximate {{the sounds of}} symphony orchestras, transcriptions of orchestral works found {{a place in the}} organ repertoire. As silent films became popular, theatre organs were installed in theatres to provide accompaniment for the films.|$|E
30|$|The {{second and}} third pairs of columns are the same {{estimation}} with the sample divided into those farm managers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> utilized risk management tools and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not. Respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> price risk management tools {{were more likely to}} purchase the offered margin insurance if they had more years of operator education. In contrast to the group of respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>used</b> risk management tools, however, the margin level for those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> price risk management tools was positive and significant. All else constant, a higher margin offers more profit protection. Respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>used</b> risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance as operator education increased and as they were closer to insolvency. Further, California respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>used</b> risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance than were Wisconsin respondents (the omitted State category).|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} better regimens in {{currently available}} chemotherapy {{would be beneficial}} to KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients because they have fewer treatment options than KRAS wild-type mCRC patients. Clinicopathologic features and overall survival (OS) of KRAS mutant and wild-type mCRC patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based, as well as cetuximab-based regimens were compared to those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used oxaliplatin-based, irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based, as well as cetuximab-based regimens respectively. Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 394 mCRC patients, in whom 169 KRAS mutant and 225 KRAS wild-type, were enrolled. In KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 131), the OS was significantly longer than that in KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 38). The OS was 28. 8 months [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 23. 2 - 34. 4] in KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> oxaliplatin-based regimens versus 17. 8 months [95 % CI: 6. 5 - 29. 1] in KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (P = 0. 026). Notably, OS in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 185) was not significantly longer than that in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used oxaliplatin-based regimens (N = 40) (P = 0. 25). Furthermore, the OS in KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> either irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based or cetuximab-based regimens was not significantly different than that in KRAS mutant patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> never-used either irinotecan-based, bevacizumab-based or cetuximab-based regimens respectively. In multivariate analyses, patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> oxaliplatin-based regimens remains an independent prognostic factor for longer OS in KRAS mutant mCRC patients. In conclusion, oxaliplatin-based regimens are more beneficial in KRAS mutant than in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients...|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> them long term.|$|E
5|$|Ono {{released}} her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured {{a photo of}} her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> screams and vocal noise in lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of discussion in the field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Mac Pro's {{main memory}} uses 667MHz DDR2 ECC FB-DIMMs; the early 2008 model uses 800MHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMMS, the 2009 and onward Mac Pro use 1066MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs {{for the standard}} models, and 1333MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs for systems configured with 2.66GHz or faster CPUs. In the original and 2008 models, these modules are installed in pairs, one each on two riser cards. The cards have 4 DIMM slots each, allowing a total of 32GB of memory (8 × 4GB) to be installed. Notably, due to its FB-DIMM architecture, installing more RAM in the Mac Pro will improve its memory bandwidth, but may also increase its memory latency. With a simple installation of a single FB-DIMM, the peak bandwidth is 8GB/s, but this can increase to 16GB/s by installing two FB-DIMMs, one {{on each of the}} two buses, which is the default configuration from Apple. While electrically the FB-DIMMs are standard, for pre-2009 Mac Pro models Apple specifies larger-than-normal heatsinks on the memory modules. Problems have been reported by users <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> third party RAM with normal size FB-DIMM heatsinks. (see notes below). 2009 and later Mac Pro computers do not require memory modules with heatsinks.|$|E

25|$|Overhand right : The {{overhand}} {{right is}} a punch {{not found in}} every boxer's arsenal.
