40|$|A wide {{class of}} {{electromagnetic}} scattering {{problems can be}} expressed as a system of dual integral equations. This kind of integral equation, occurring in boundary value problems wherein there is one equation for a certain region and another for the dual domain, is usual in diffraction problems. Considerable attention has been drawn by many researchers {{in the field of}} optics, acoustics, scattering of elastic waves, accelerator physics, and antenna theory. <b>Wiener-Hopf</b> <b>techniques</b> enable us to solve such kinds of integral equations when the two regions are contiguous and semi-infinite. Unfortunately <b>Wiener-Hopf</b> <b>techniques</b> do not apply if one of the regions is finite; this is the case for realistic scatterers, such as irises, antennas, and drift tubes in accelerators. In this article a general method for solving such dual integral equations is discussed and applied to a particular case: Hallen's equation of cylindrical antennas. This method consists of a transformation of the dual integral equations into a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind and then into a linear system of algebraic equations.

Contrary to prior analytical studies, using <b>Wiener-Hopf</b> <b>techniques</b> and thus restricted to semi-infinite plates, we use a, finite elements method which allows us to deal with plates of finite length. To take into account irrotational perturbations induced by the trailing edge of the plate, a potential formulation requires the introduction of a vortex sheet behind the plate. The key point of the method is to get access at the singular coefficient of the velocity potential near the trailing edge, in order to cancel it using the so-called Kutta-Joukowski condition. This approach leads to an efficient finite elements method, and numerical computations are presented: we show the amplitude of the vortex sheet versus the Mach number and the plate length and the dissipated acoustic power versus the Mach number and the frequency. This method is extended to the case of two aligned plates to analyze the influence of the choice of the boundary condition on the downstream plate which interacts with a vortex sheet. © IMACS...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{a problem}} of anti-plane shear in a bi-material plane {{containing}} a semi-infinite crack situated on a soft imperfect interface. The plane also contains a small thin inclusion (for instance an ellipse with high eccentricity) whose influence on the propagation of the main crack we investigate. An important element of our approach is the derivation of a new weight function (a special solution to a homogeneous boundary value problem) in the imperfect interface setting. The weight function is derived using Fourier transform and <b>Wiener-Hopf</b> <b>techniques</b> and allows us to obtain an expression for an important constant (which {{may be used in}} a fracture criterion) that describes the leading order of tractions near the crack tip for the unperturbed problem. We present computations that demonstrate how this constant varies depending on the extent of interface imperfection and contrast in material stiffness. We then perform perturbation analysis to derive an expression for the change in the leading order of tractions near the tip of the main crack induced by the presence of the small defect, whose sign can be interpreted as the inclusion's presence having an amplifying or shielding effect on the propagation of the main crack.
