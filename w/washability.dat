Sun protective clothing and UV protective fabrics in Australia now follow a lab-testing procedure regulated by a federal agency: ARPANSA. This standard was established in 1996 after work by Australian swimwear companies. The British standard was established in 1998 by the National Radiological Protection Board and the British Standards Institute. Using the Australian method as a model, the USA standard was formally established in 2001, and now employs a more-stringent testing protocol that includes fabric longevity, abrasion/wear and <b>washability.</b> UPF testing is now widely used on clothing for outdoor activities.|$|E
50|$|Nonwoven fabrics are {{engineered}} fabrics {{that may}} have a limited life, single-use fabric or a very durable fabric. Nonwoven fabrics provide specific functions such as absorbency, liquid repellence, resilience, stretch, softness, strength, flame retardancy, <b>washability,</b> cushioning, thermal insulation, acoustic insulation, filtration, use as a bacterial barrier and sterility. These properties are often combined to create fabrics suited for specific jobs, while achieving a good balance between product use-life and cost. They can mimic the appearance, texture and strength of a woven fabric and can be as bulky as the thickest paddings. In combination with other materials they provide a spectrum of products with diverse properties, and are used alone or as components of apparel, home furnishings, health care, engineering, industrial and consumer goods.|$|E

50|$|The <b>washability</b> {{analysis}} is widely known in bulk material analysis, where the specific density is the physical property describing the liberation and the separation results, {{which is then}} {{in the form of}} the partition curve. The partition curve is defined as the curve which gives as a function of a physical property or characteristic, the proportions in which different elemental classes of raw feed having the same property are split into separate products. It is thus per its definition not limited to, but predominantly applied in analysis of liberation and process efficiency of density separation processes.For sensor-based ore sorting, the partition (also called Tromp) curves for chromite, iron ore and coal are known and can thus be applied for process modelling.|$|E
50|$|Precondition for the {{applicability}} of sensor-based ore sorting {{is the presence of}} liberation at the particle size of interest. Before entering into sensor-based ore sorting testing procedures there is the possibility to assess the degree of liberation through the inspection of drill cores, hand-counting and <b>washability</b> analysis. The quantification of liberation does not include any process efficiencies, but gives an estimate of the possible sorting result and can thus be applied for desktop financial feasibility analysis.Drill core analysisBoth for green-field and brown-field applications, inspection of drill core in combination with the grade distribution and mineralogical description is a good option for estimation of the liberation characteristics and the possible success of sensor-based ore sorting. In combination with the mining method and mine plan, an estimation of possible grade distribution in coarse particles can be done.|$|E
50|$|As for {{any other}} {{physical}} separation process, liberation is pre-requisite for possible separation. Liberation characteristics are well known and relatively easy to study for particulate lots in smaller size ranges, e.g. flotation feed and products. The analysis is essential for understanding the possible results of physical separation and relatively easy to conduct in laboratory {{on a couple of}} dozens of grams of sample which can be studied using optical methods or such as the QEMSCAN. For larger particles above 10 mm it is widely known for applications that are treated using density separation methods, such as coal or iron ore. Here, the <b>washability</b> analysis can be conducted on sample masses up to 10 tonnes in equipped laboratories.For sensor-based sorting, where laboratory methods can only tell about the liberation characteristics where the describing feature is the density (e.g. iron ore, coal), hand counting, single-particle tests and bulk tests can reveal the liberation characteristics of a bulk material: Hereby, only single particle tests reveal the true liberation, while hand counting and bulk testing give a result which also incorporates the separation efficiency of the type of analysis.More information on the testing procedures used in technical feasibility evaluation {{can be found in the}} respective chapter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Washability</b> {{analysis}} {{is the basis}} for nearly all coal preparation plant separations. Unfortunately, there are no on- line techniques for determining this most fundamental of all coal cleaning information. In light of recent successes at the University of Utah, it now appears possible to determine coal <b>washability</b> on-line through the use of x-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis. The successful development of such a device is critical to the establishment of process control and automated coal blending systems. In this regard, Virginia Tech, Terra Tek Inc., and U. S. coal producers have joined with the University of Utah and to undertake the development of an X-ray CT-based on- line coal <b>washability</b> analyzer with financial assistance from DOE. Each project participant brought special expertise to the project {{in order to create a}} new dimension in coal cleaning technology. The project involves development of appropriate software and extensive testing/evaluation of well-characterized coal samples from operating coal preparation plants. Data collected to date suggest that this new technology is capable of serving as a universal analyzer that can not only provide <b>washability</b> analysis, but also particle size distribution analysis, ash analysis, and perhaps pyritic sulfur analysis...|$|E
40|$|The most {{critical}} parameters for the efficient design of coal processing operations {{depend on the}} assessment of coal breakage and <b>washability</b> characteristics of the coal resource. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) technology has been demonstrated to have the capability of analyzing <b>washability</b> and fragmentation parameters (particle size, energy, coal type). In this regard, progeny size distributions are obtained from sequential modified drop shatter tests (different input energy levels) and from XCT analysis. In this way, the breakage characteristics (selection and breakage functions) of coal particles are established and the prediction of particle size distribution (PSD) for different levels of energy input is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Conventional coal <b>washability</b> {{analysis}} {{is achieved by}} conducting Float and Sink (FaS) test, which is sampling dependent, destructive and uses environmentally hazardous chemicals. With the improvement of modern 2 D and 3 D imaging technologies, image analysis methods of digital CT scanned images are being developed and trialled to predict coal <b>washability</b> in a more flexible, efficient and safe way. To support the validity of this approach, this study illustrates the fundamental differences in breakage and liberation behaviour of coal lithotypes at the same rank from a single seam. Nine lithotype samples were repeatedly CT scanned before and {{after a series of}} 2 m drops to emulate fragmentation during the drop shatter test. The 3 D watershed segmentation method was applied to scans to monitor changes in fragment size distribution and then assign a density to each fragment to obtain coal <b>washability.</b> Comparison between the processed image analysis results and FaS tests conducted after 31 drops show a very good match both in particle size distribution and coal <b>washability</b> for all the lithotypes. Results also show that dull coal or stone illustrate better agreement between CT image analysis and FaS test due to their very low percentage of small particles which may lead to underestimation when using CT image analysis. Possible ways of improving small particles estimation would be to use an XY plane H-maxima method and low merging coefficient in the image analysis process...|$|E
40|$|Hughes’ has {{proposed}} a method {{for dealing with the}} problems of interpolating coal <b>washability</b> data which eliminates many of the difficulties encountered in previously proposed procedures. In particular, the problem of the interpolating function becoming negative was solved, but the computational procedure proposed was not suited to convenient computation. Lyman modified the solution to provide a smoother interpolating function, recast the computations in a manner well-suited to fully-automatic operation, and generalised and further extended the method to deal with a more difficult problem relating to interpolation of bulk density, size distribution and density distributions as a function of bed depth in samples taken from a jig bed. These methods were implemented in a major project by the author. This paper presents the mathematical background to both applications and provides an example of their application to simple interpolation of <b>washability</b> information. The second paper of this pair provides examples of the more complex application of the method to data arising from sampling a jig bed in layers, and the third paper considers two-dimensional interpolation of <b>washability</b> data...|$|E

40|$|Coal {{preparation}} {{is widely regarded}} as a cost effective method for reducing the amounts of potentially hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPPs) that occur as trace elements in the run-of-mine coals. Unfortunately, many existing coal preparation plants are inefficient in removing trace elements because of poor circuit design and inadequate liberation of coal and mineral matter. These problems are often difficult to correct in the absence of characterization data regarding the mineralogical association and <b>washability</b> of trace elements in run-of-mine coals.
