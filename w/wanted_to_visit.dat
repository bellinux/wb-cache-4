5|$|August 9, 1970 was a Sunday, and Flight 502 was {{originally}} scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8:30 am, but {{since many of}} the members of the American group <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the nearby Pisac native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima, the airline postponed the departure time to 2:45 pm.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E

25|$|The {{ship was}} named after the former Austrian Prime Minister and Interior Minister Paul Gautsch von Frankenthurn. Baron Gautsch and its sister ships were built for the {{so-called}} Dalmatian Express Line, a route that went south of the Austrian Riviera {{along the coast of}} Istria and Dalmatia. The home port of each ship was Trieste. Baron Gautsch carried commuters, business and leisure travelers and summer guests who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the popular seaside resorts of the Adriatic. It had its maiden voyage on June 16, 1908.|$|E

He said that he just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> some friends {{and have a good}} time. When asked by a reporter whether Henry Ford was a financial supporter of the effort to restore the monarchy in Russia, Boris did not know who Henry Ford was. His brother, Grand Duke Kyril, wanted to restore the Russian monarchy and in 1924 proclaimed himself czar-in-exile, but Boris was largely uninterested in politics.|$|E

Having heard stories about his parents' ancestors, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Africa, which he considered his spiritual home. Delany and three other young black men were accepted into Harvard Medical School but African Americans were not accepted into the school after white students reportedly petitioned the school to exclude non-white applicants.|$|E

25|$|Afriqiyah Airways {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that relatives of the victims who wished to visit Libya would be transported and accommodated at Afriqiyah's expense. The Libyan authorities relaxed certain passport restrictions and guaranteed the granting of visas. By 15 May 2010 the airline opened the Family Assistance Centre in a hotel in Tripoli to care for family members and relatives of crash victims who were visiting Libya. The executive team of Afriqiyah, including the CEO and the chairperson of the board, met family members at the hotel. Some family members <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the crash site; they travelled to the site and placed flowers there. The airline permanently retired the flight number 771 and it has been re-designated to 788 for Tripoli to Johannesburg and 789 for the return flight.|$|E
25|$|Marina's friend Ruth Paine transported Marina and {{her child}} by car from New Orleans to the Paine home in Irving, Texas, near Dallas, on September 23, 1963. Oswald stayed in New Orleans {{at least two more}} days to collect a $33 {{unemployment}} check. It is uncertain when he left New Orleans; he is next known to have boarded a bus in Houston on September 26—bound for the Mexican border, rather than Dallas—and to have told other bus passengers that he planned to travel to Cuba via Mexico. He arrived in Mexico City on September 27, where he applied for a transit visa at the Cuban Embassy, claiming he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Cuba {{on his way to the}} Soviet Union. The Cuban embassy officials insisted Oswald would need Soviet approval, but he was unable to get prompt co-operation from the Soviet embassy.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} Sundar Singh had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Britain, and the {{opportunity}} came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave him the money for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled {{by what he saw}} as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found everywhere, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be. Once back in India he continued his Gospel-proclamation work, though {{it was clear that he}} was getting more physically frail.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the legend}} of chiles en nogada, there were three sisters {{from the city of}} Puebla who were in Mexico City. When the Army of the Three Guarantees entered the capital {{at the end of the}} Mexican War of Independence, they were feted by many. At one of these parties, the three sisters fell in love with three of the army’s officers. Soon after, Agustín de Iturbide himself was set to visit the city of Puebla. Remembering the sisters, the soon-to-be emperor <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> them. Wanting to impress Iturbide but not knowing how to cook, the sisters turned to the nuns of the Santa Monica convent who were famous for their food. The nuns decided to invent a dish for the sisters, which would {{represent}} the three colors of the new Mexican flag. On the appointed day, the banquet was prepared with the dish now called chiles en nogada, which pleased Iturbide.|$|E
500|$|In November, Hańska {{suffered}} a miscarriage; {{she wrote to}} Balzac with the tragic news. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her, but Anna wrote asking him to remain in Paris. The emotion involved, she wrote, [...] "would be fatal". Hańska made {{plans to return to}} Wierzchownia, but Balzac begged her to visit him, which she did in the spring of 1847. As soon as she was back in Ukraine, however, a new wrinkle unfolded. Hańska had long been unhappy with the presence of Balzac's housekeeper, Louise Breugniot, and he promised to break with her before marrying. He wrote with alarm to Hańska explaining that Breugninot had stolen her letters to him and blackmailed the author for 30,000 francs. Biographers disagree about truth of this story; Robb suggests it was [...] "a convincing hysterical performance put on for the benefit of his jealous fiancée".|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{planned to}} drive {{most of his}} second tour of cities, which {{concentrated}} on places he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> in Europe. For the trip he took his own car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible, crossing the channel and journeying through Ostend, Antwerp and Bremen before arriving at his first destination: Hamburg. He stayed only briefly in the city, praising the sex industry by writing [...] "how {{very different from the}} prudish and hypocritical manner in which we so disgracefully mismanage these things in England". Fleming moved on to Berlin, where he was shown round the city by The Sunday Times correspondent Anthony Terry and his wife Rachel. Terry took Fleming into East Berlin and told him many of the details about Operation Stopwatch, the Anglo-American attempt to tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters. In comparison to Hamburg, Fleming thought Berlin was [...] "sinister".|$|E

500|$|During pre-production, {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that several actresses including Genelia D'Souza, Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor were {{being considered for}} the role of Kaali Gawde. However, Chopra was approached over the others, who agreed to do the film instantly. While initial reports suggested that Chopra would be playing the role of a sex worker in the film, they were later denied as rumours. In an interview with Rediff.com, she clarified that she was playing a prostitute's daughter. On Chopra's character, Malhotra commented, [...] "Despite being a male dominated film, the part played by Priyanka is very prominent. It isn't that of a simple or ordinary lover. She is there for Vijay unconditionally and without any expectations. With all the dangerous people around her, she is like this pretty flower standing there with a smile on her face." [...] In preparation for her role, Chopra <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1947, Cameron {{travelled}} from New York to Paris aboard the SS America {{with the intention of}} studying art at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, which she hoped would admit her with a letter of recommendation from Pasadena's Art Center School. She also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> England and meet with Crowley and explain to him Parsons' Babalon Working. [...] Cameron learned upon her arrival in Paris that Crowley had died and that she had not been admitted to the college. She found post-war Paris [...] "extreme and bleak", befriended Juliette Gréco, and spent three weeks in Switzerland before returning home. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons suggested that she read Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection and encouraged her to read James Frazer's The Golden Bough, Heinrich Zimmer's The King and the Corpse, and Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Although she still did not accept Thelema, she became increasingly interested in the occult, and in particular the use of the tarot.|$|E

Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the same world each year to maintain a sense of continuity, {{something that could be}} hard to do with Doctor Who formula. Producer Phil Collinson remarked that [...] "Gridlock" [...] displayed Davies' tendency to write about [...] "topical" [...] issues; it is set in a dark dystopian future, but is also a satire on the common traffic jam. While the story is bleak, Davies showed how the Doctor transforms the place by literally opening up the sky and bringing in light. Davies also used hymns to signify hope and a togetherness {{of the members of the}} Motorway. Those on the Motorway sing [...] "The Old Rugged Cross", and the hymn heard at the end of the episode is [...] "Abide with Me". The episode also displays the Doctor's growing attachment to Martha; he feels guilty for lying to her and bringing her to New New York just to show off and realises that he misses her when she is taken.|$|E

500|$|In Chicago, {{he worked}} as an {{associate}} editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where he met novelist Sherwood Anderson. When St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit the sister of Hemingway's roommate, Hemingway became infatuated and later claimed, [...] "I knew she was the girl I was going to marry". Hadley, red-haired, with a [...] "nurturing instinct", was eight years older than Hemingway. Despite being older than Hemingway, Hadley, who had grown up with an overprotective mother, seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age. Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims Hadley was [...] "evocative" [...] of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked. The two corresponded for a few months and then decided to marry and travel to Europe. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the young couple. They were married on September 3, 1921; two months later, Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star, and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: [...] "With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe." ...|$|E

The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland scratching {{his face in the}} process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. Ekland later reported that although the couple argued, Sellers never hit her. During his next film, The Bobo, which again co-starred Ekland, the couple's marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife, saying [...] "I'm not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set". Ekland later stated that the marriage was [...] "an atrocious sham" [...] at this stage. In the midst of filming The Bobo, Sellers's mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellers's friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, The Bobo was poorly received.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} series of 3 {{experiments}} to explore how different types of staging, pictures versus virtual reality, impacts potential buyers’ likelihood of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a home. Moreover, this study seeks to address how the type of market, hot versus cold, and type of home, luxury versus non-luxury, connects with staging {{and its impact on}} <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a home. In Experiment 1, participants will view 10 total homes, 5 randomly selected with staged pictures first followed by the remaining 5 with virtual reality, either within the hot or cold market. If VR increases presence, then people should be more likely <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a house especially in a hot market given that there is a high demand for a constrained supply. Experiment 2 addressed the contrast effect limitation given that virtual reality staging always came after the pictures of staging within Experiment 1. Experiment 2 should replicate the results of Experiment 1 by removing the contrast effect. Finally, Experiment 3 will explore the impact of type of home, luxury versus non-luxury, and type of staging on <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> a home. Researchers are expected to find that participants who viewed properties in virtual reality are more likely <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the home compared to those that saw staged images because of increased presence, which will make them feel more connected to the home compared to viewing staged pictures. Ultimately, this study is important because it aims to identify the utility of VR in home sales...|$|R
