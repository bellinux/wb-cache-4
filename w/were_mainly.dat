5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E

Interlayer heterogeneity <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> embodied as big {{differences among}} layers in vertical direction.

50|$|The {{economy of}} Chimerica <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{based on two}} export crops, cotton and coffee. The cotton {{industry}} <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> dominated by large landowners, whereas coffee fields <b>are</b> <b>mainly</b> held by small to medium-sized coffee growers. Most of Chimerica's food (primarily corn, flour, beans, and rice) is produced by campesinos.|$|R
5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|Each {{team had}} to {{progress}} through six knockout rounds playing 12 matches in total {{to reach the}} final. Liverpool's matches <b>were</b> <b>mainly</b> close affairs, none of their ties were won by more than two goals. The semi-final tie against Barcelona was won 1–0. In contrast, Alavés ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories.

40|$|Wireless systems <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> {{based on}} the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to split the input signals into number of sub carrier signals. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing requires an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). The inverse fast Fourier transform <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to produce multiple sub-carriers signal. The FFT/IFFT processor for OFDM applications is described in this paper. The architecture uses single path delay feedback style and it occupies less memory space. The read only memory <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to store the twiddle factors. To eliminate the Read Only Memory (ROM) a ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor is used. The reconfigurable complex multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to achieve the ROM-less FFT/IFFT processor and the bit parallel multipliers <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used for square root evaluation. The Fused Multiply Add (FMA) operation {{is very important in}} many scientific and engineering fields. The floating point unit increases the performance and accuracy of the floating point. The Fused Multiply and Add unit <b>is</b> <b>mainly</b> used to reduce the latency and power...|$|R
