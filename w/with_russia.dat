5|$|After her commissioning, Sachsen {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} the most likely enemies in a continental war.

These formed the basis for the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which Sachsen took part.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion.

5|$|Another {{conflicting}} issue between Darejan and her reigning step-son was Georgia's {{relations with}} the Russian Empire. Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795. The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship <b>with</b> <b>Russia</b> had brought no benefit to Georgia.|$|E

Courland, which had remained with the Commonwealth, assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade. After Frederick William's last Prussian homage before the Polish king in 1641, the Commonwealth's position in regard to Prussia and its Hohenzollern rulers kept getting weaker.|$|E

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, <b>with</b> <b>Russia</b> faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E

Russia relinquished most of Ingria but left Narva and Ivangorod under Swedish control. Originally scheduled to last three years, the Russo-Swedish truce was later extended until 1590. During the negotiations, Sweden made vast demands for Russian territory, including Novgorod. Whilst these conditions were probably only {{for the purposes of}} negotiation, they may have reflected Swedish aspirations of territory in the region.|$|E
