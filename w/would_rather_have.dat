5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a new apartment than the money.|$|E

5|$|By about 1864, {{both sides}} {{regarded}} the ship {{as a white}} elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the Dunderberg as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, {{in the hope of}} getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The New York Times estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.|$|E
5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build a ramp to the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> a ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge. Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{was dismayed}} by Spencer's decision, and {{declared}} that he <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> received no title {{than that of a}} mere barony. He was however cheered by the attention showered on him by the citizens of Naples, the prestige accorded him by the kingdom's elite, and the comforts he received at the Hamiltons' residence. He made frequent visits to attend functions in his honour, or to tour nearby attractions with Emma, with whom he had by now fallen deeply in love, almost constantly at his side. Orders arrived from the Admiralty to blockade the French forces in Alexandria and Malta, a task Nelson delegated to his captains, Samuel Hood and Alexander Ball. Despite enjoying his lifestyle in Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England, but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife Maria Carolina of Austria and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian General Mack and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind. Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons. The evacuation got under way on 23 December and sailed through heavy gales before reaching the safety of Palermo on 26 December.|$|E

25|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} common among {{children}} from, low-income, African American and Hispanic communities.

Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to encase a hedgehog in clay and bake it.

25|$|Outstanding debts {{were also}} agreed {{and the company}} {{permitted}} to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company. So urgent was the need to supply the armed forces in the United Kingdom, America and elsewhere that the authorities sometimes {{turned a blind eye}} on the untaxed sales.

25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} case {{and one which}} {{has given rise to}} long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.|$|E

25|$|Although the repartimiento has {{historically}} been seen as an imposition on the indigenous, forcing them into economic relations they <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> avoided and maintained by force, recent work on eighteenth-century Oaxaca analyzes the nexus of crown officials (the alcaldes mayores) and Spanish merchants, and indigenous via the repartimiento. cash loaned by local crown officials (the alcalde mayor and his teniente), usually to individual Indians but sometimes to communities, {{in exchange for a}} fixed amount of a good (cochineal or cotton mantles) at a later date.

25|$|Sir Charles Deedes later (in September 1968) {{wrote that}} Wilson’s energy and {{foresight}} in 1910–14 had ensured that Britain {{would take her}} place alongside France when war came. An alternative view, aired {{as early as the}} 1920s, is that Wilson locked Britain into a continental commitment which Kitchener <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> avoided or minimised. Jeffrey is critical of some historians – e.g. Zara Steiner in Britain and the Origins of the First World War, Gerhard Ritter in The Sword and the Sceptre – who take an oversimplified view of Wilson as a supporter of the French position. Although Wilson’s verbal fluency and charm brought him great influence, his position was also supported by most of his military colleagues and by the most influential members of the Cabinet. Furthermore, this ignores Wilson’s interest in reaching a military agreement with Belgium.|$|E
25|$|The move by {{retailers}} to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as {{opposed to the}} traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest. In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself.

25|$|In New South Wales, Democrat {{preferences}} {{flowing to}} Labor {{rather than the}} Greens were instrumental in Labor's winning of the last Senate seat. Had Democrat preferences flown to the Greens rather than Liberals for Forests and the Christian Democrats, then the final vacancy would have been won by the Greens' John Kaye. The scale of Glenn Druery's (of the Liberals for Forests party) preference deals was revealed by {{the large number of}} ticket votes distributed when he was eliminated from the count. He gained preferences {{from a wide range of}} minor parties such as the Ex-Service Service and Veterans Party, the Outdoor Recreation Party, and the Non-Custodial Parents Party. Liberals for Forests also gained the preferences of two leftish parties – the Progressive Labour Party and the HEMP Party.
