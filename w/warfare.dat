5|$|Advances {{were made}} in nearly every aspect of naval <b>warfare,</b> most notably with {{aircraft}} carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical <b>warfare</b> had relatively little success {{at the start of}} the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.|$|E
5|$|After the Malayan {{conflict}} {{ended in}} 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding {{that the use}} of defoliants was a legal tactic of <b>warfare.</b> Secretary of State Dean Rusk advised President John F.

5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European <b>warfare,</b> which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland <b>warfare.</b> Neither liked the irregular <b>warfare</b> practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in <b>warfare</b> for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in <b>warfare</b> dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in <b>warfare</b> was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E

5|$|News of Modern <b>Warfare</b> Remastered {{was leaked}} on Reddit on April 27, 2016 {{prior to its}} announcement. The leak {{revealed}} a screenshot of a reservation card for the online store Target that included the Legacy Edition of Infinite <b>Warfare</b> and the bundled remaster.

5|$|The AgustaWestland AW101 is a {{medium-sized}} multi-role helicopter. Two versions are in service with the UK armed forces, {{where it is}} known as Merlin. The utility version can carry up to twenty-four troops seated or sixteen stretcher patients and the HM2 anti-submarine <b>warfare</b> variant has a dipping sonar and sonar-buoys, and a complete electronic <b>warfare</b> suite.|$|E
5|$|The JNA was {{initially}} formed during World War II {{to carry out}} guerrilla <b>warfare</b> against occupying Axis forces. The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla <b>warfare,</b> as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks, where other types of <b>warfare</b> would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial Defense system.|$|E
5|$|The United States Naval Special <b>Warfare</b> Command (NAVSPECWARCOM, NAVSOC, or NSWC) was {{commissioned}} April 16, 1987, at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego as the Naval component to the United States Special Operations Command. Naval Special <b>Warfare</b> Command provides vision, leadership, doctrinal guidance, resources and oversight to ensure component {{special operations forces}} are ready to meet the operational requirements of combatant commanders. Today, SEAL Teams and Special Boat Teams comprise the elite combat units of Naval Special <b>Warfare.</b> These teams are organized, trained, and equipped to conduct a variety of missions to include direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, unconventional <b>warfare</b> and support psychological and civil affairs operations. Their highly trained operators are deployed worldwide in support of National Command Authority objectives, conducting operations with other conventional and special operations forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in <b>warfare</b> {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in <b>warfare</b> dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of <b>warfare</b> from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot <b>warfare</b> common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|Toniná was an {{aggressive}} {{state in the}} Late Classic, using <b>warfare</b> to develop a powerful kingdom. For much of its history, Toniná was engaged in sporadic <b>warfare</b> with Palenque, its greatest rival {{and one of the}} most important polities in the west of the Maya region, although Toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west.|$|E
5|$|World War I saw great {{changes in}} the use of cavalry. The mode of <b>warfare</b> changed, and the use of trench <b>warfare,</b> barbed wire and machine guns {{rendered}} traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Exeter, Band served in junior officer {{appointments}} in HMS Lewiston and HMS Rothesay. He was confirmed in {{the rank of}} sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1971. In the mid 1970s, he undertook an exchange programme with the United States Navy and served on board the guided missile cruiser, USS Belknap, which is now no longer in service. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 January 1974. Following <b>warfare</b> training in 1976 and 1977 he served for two years as the principal <b>warfare</b> officer and operations officer on board the frigate HMS Eskimo. This appointment included deployments to the West Indies and South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal <b>warfare.</b> This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal <b>warfare</b> made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom <b>warfare</b> was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 7th century Muhammad was {{attacked}} by non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism. In modern times, criticism has also dealt with Muhammad's sincerity in claiming to be a prophet, his morality, <b>warfare,</b> and his marriages.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine <b>warfare</b> campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine <b>warfare</b> ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|During {{its service}} 369 of the regiment's men died from all causes, either killed in action, died of wounds or of disease. Another 453 men were wounded, some more than once. More {{than half of}} the dead, 207 men, were killed during the seven months they fought in the static trench <b>warfare</b> of the Gallipoli Campaign; another 129 men were killed during their two years of more mobile <b>warfare</b> in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.

5|$|Epaminondas {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an {{advisory}} capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to swing the vote in favour of battle.* Sage, <b>Warfare</b> in Ancient Greece, 138; Seager, The King's Peace, 183 During {{the course of the}} battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical <b>warfare</b> facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, and references to germs, germ <b>warfare</b> and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|General Wavell was {{familiar}} with desert <b>warfare,</b> having been a liaison officer with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, and he understood and endorsed Bagnold's suggested concept. Wavell assisted in equipping the force.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman {{was born}} January 31, 1964 in Oakland, California, {{and grew up}} in Long Beach, California in a family {{containing}} several war veterans: his father fought in Normandy during World War II and his brothers in Vietnam, making <b>warfare</b> a common conversation topic at the dinner table. War films were popular on TV at the time, and Hanneman often joined his brothers in constructing and coloring tank and plane models. His interest in <b>warfare</b> and military history has been attributed to his upbringing.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{were well}} suited to the <b>warfare</b> tactics of the nomadic {{cultures}} from the steppes of Central Asia. Several East Asian cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. Muslim warriors relied upon light cavalry in their campaigns throughout North Africa, Asia, and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the Middle Ages, and the best-known heavy cavalry warrior of the period was the armoured knight. With {{the decline of the}} knight and rise of gunpowder in <b>warfare,</b> light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European <b>warfare</b> and in the conquest of the Americas. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the Napoleonic wars. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted <b>warfare</b> tactics were learned by several tribes of indigenous people and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite <b>Warfare</b> and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite <b>Warfare</b> in order to obtain a remaster of Modern <b>Warfare,</b> a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Navy {{unveiled}} a $4-million training facility, using simulators and virtual reality, at the Naval Undersea <b>Warfare</b> Center Division Keyport on Ford Island.
