5|$|The Guides were disbanded in January 1862 {{after the}} Confederate {{government}} of Kentucky fled Bowling Green, as Hines did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> anywhere except in Kentucky. He traveled to Richmond, Virginia, {{and missed the}} Battle of Shiloh as a result. In April, he decided to join Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, and he re-enlisted in the army as a private in the 9th Kentucky Cavalry in May 1862. Morgan recognized Hines' talents and commissioned him as a captain on June 10, 1862. Afterward, Hines {{spent most of his}} time engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky. Dressed in civilian clothes, he usually operated alone to avoid drawing attention to himself, not wanting to be executed as a spy.|$|E
5|$|In {{a memorable}} event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon's 39th {{birthday}} celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich's {{attendance at the}} Congress of Erfurt; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful. In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings {{about the possibility of}} Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain. His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon, that Russia was unlikely to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> Austria, and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe. Back in Paris, Metternich was overtly apprehensive about his own safety. When Austria declared war on France, Metternich was indeed arrested in retaliation for the arrest of two French diplomats in Vienna, but the effects of this were minimal. He was allowed to leave France under escort for Austria in late May 1809. After Napoleon's capture of Vienna Metternich was conducted to the Austrian capital and exchange there for the French diplomats.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, Sudan had {{no federal}} anti-corruption agency. Corruption charges were almost never investigated, {{although}} the Auditor General urged {{the prosecution of}} certain officials for embezzling public funds. At an emergency cabinet meeting in March 2014, President Bashir ordered his Council of Ministers to combat corruption and introduced an anti-corruption reform plan which would be implemented by a new committee and five new sub-committees. Despite the government's claims to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> corruption, its anti-corruption agency has so far failed to bring corrupt public officials to justice.|$|E

Both boxers fought a smart fight, with Norton using a heavy body attack whilst Young moved well and countered. The decision was controversial, with many observers thinking Young had done enough to win.|$|E

While Pakistani law would normally give his father custody, his father did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the passionate public opinion supporting his aunt Fawzia. He now lives with his aunt in Karachi, who has prohibited him from talking to the press. In April 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed a 12-year-old girl found outside a house in Karachi was identified by DNA as Siddiqui's daughter, Mariyam, {{and that she had}} been returned to her family.

The CIA realizes there are other extraterrestrials and secretly plans to find and detain them. Unknown to the agency, the agent chosen to head the effort is himself one of those extraterrestrials.

25|$|On about August 9 Armijo {{called a}} meeting {{with a number of}} {{respected}} New Mexicans. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> but the priests present did, as did the young regular-army commander, Diego Archuleta, and the young militia officers Manuel Chaves and Miguel Pino. According to a refugee from the war, Armijo would have done nothing toward defense if the latter two had not threatened to shoot him. Then on August 12 or 13 he received an American named James Magoffin, the husband of a relative of his, who later claimed to have convinced Armijo not to fight. An unverified story says that Magoffin bribed them. Magoffin later requested a reimbursement from the U. S. Treasury of $50,000, of which he received $30,000.|$|E
25|$|Fabius {{refused to}} move from his camp despite the pleas of his {{officers}} and the urgings of Minucius. The Roman army made ready and stood at arms but did not move out. Fabius did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> a night battle, fearing a Punic trick to draw the Romans into a battle over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry will lose their edge as their lines would be broken, and communication would be hampered. Hannibal had previously hoodwinked and destroyed two Roman armies at Trebbia and Trasimene and the cautious Fabius did not want his army to be the third. Thus, although Hannibal still managed to trick the Romans, the Romans only suffered loss of face but not the loss of another army.|$|E
25|$|By a large margin, {{moderation}} had won {{out over}} calls for war. Unlike Western Democrats, most Congressmen—like Polk—did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for 54°40′. The Polk administration then made it {{known that the}} British government should offer terms to settle the dispute. Despite the cooling diplomatic relations, {{a repeat of the}} War of 1812 was not popular with either nation's government. Time was of the essence, because it was well known that the Peel government would fall with the impending repeal of the Corn Laws in the United Kingdom, and then negotiations would have to begin again with a new ministry. At a time when the European continental balance was a far more pressing problem, a costly war with a major trading partner was not popular with the British government. Aberdeen and McLane quickly worked out a compromise and sent it to the United States.|$|E

25|$|Obeying this order, General Farhat {{began the}} journey to his post as {{governor}} of El Kef and the Ounifa tribe on 16 April 1864. As the region around El Kef was now in revolt, he asked for an armed escort, but the Bey had no men to spare. Farhat therefore asked his deputy {{to come out to}} meet him with 150 spahis from the town. Ignoring his deputy's advice not to proceed because of the danger, he continued to make for his post as ordered. When he reached the pass at Khanguet el Gdim, 21km from El Kef, he was surrounded by insurgents. The spahis, who came from the same tribe as them, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> them, and melted away, leaving him only with eight of his attendants. All were slaughtered. The olive tree, pockmarked with bullets, where he met his end was venerated for many years until it was cut down and burned in around 1950.|$|E
25|$|Lovat, Forbes and Rose formed {{up their}} united {{forces on the}} side of the River Ness {{opposite}} Inverness Castle. The Inverness Burgh Council (who supported the Jacobites) sent out a messenger asking for help from the chief of the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch. The MacDonalds approached the Frasers from the rear but Lovat sent the Reverend Thomas Fraser of Stratherrick to parlay with them and as Keppoch MacDonald did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> his way into Inverness he headed south through the hills. Sir John Mackenzie of Coul had also sent a message to the Clan Mackintosh chief at Moy Hall requesting that he send 500 men to reinforce the 300 Mackenzies in Inverness. In response Lovat ordered his troops to break camp and head south of Inverness threatening to lay waste to Mackintosh country. The Mackintoshes backed down and swore that they only moved to defend their lands against MacDonald of Keppoch and that they did not want to take part in the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|On March 22, 2008, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Roy was {{involved}} in another on-ice incident during Game 2 of a first-round playoff series against the rival Saguenéens. Late in the second period, in which the Saguenéens were leading 7–1, a brawl started and Remparts goaltender Jonathan Roy, Patrick Roy's son, charged towards opposing goaltender Bobby Nadeau. The younger Roy hit Nadeau numerous times despite Nadeau indicating he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> After knocking Nadeau down, Roy continued to hit him. Roy then fought a second Saguenéens player before skating off the ice while holding both middle fingers up to the crowd. Patrick Roy denied inciting his son to fight, despite video evidence showing Roy making a gesture towards his son while he was advancing towards Nadeau. After investigation by the League office, Jonathan Roy was suspended for seven games and fined $500, while Patrick Roy was suspended for five games and fined $4,000. The Quebec Ministry of Public Safety has launched a police investigation into the matter. In late July 2008, Jonathan was charged with assault in Saguenay courts.|$|E

500|$|As the medievalist Gwendolyn Morgan observes, Joan's sanity is a {{continuing}} theme throughout the film, beginning with the priest questioning her {{as a child and}} ending with her conversations with 'The Conscience' in the film's final scenes. [...] Scholars view The Conscience as providing a postmodern explanation of Joan's visions. At the time that Joan lived, her voices and visions would not have been doubted. John Aberth, writing in the book A Knight at the Movies stated the filmmakers invented The Conscience to satisfy a modern audience that is aware of mental illness. The film was also said to have [...] "feminist undercurrents"; after Joan witnesses the rape of her sister, her crusade is said to become [...] "a fight against male domination and the abuse of women." [...] Writing in Exemplaria, Nickolas Haydock also considered the witnessing of her sister's murder and rape to be an alternate psychological motivation for Joan to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the English, rather than just her visions.|$|E

It has been observed that, unlike Disney's three previous animated efforts (The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), the romantic relationship between Nala and Simba is not main plot of the film.
