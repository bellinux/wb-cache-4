[...] The Guardian advocated the show's revival, arguing that [...] "a revamped Press Gang with Moffat at the helm could turn the show from a cult into a national institution - a petri dish for young acting and writing talent to thrive. It's part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation." ...|$|E

500|$|Since no new Futurama {{projects}} were in production, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder {{was designed to}} stand as the Futurama series finale.

500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit in our faces for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what I did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

500|$|Artist Brian Bolland's {{version of}} the Joker stemmed in part from his having {{recently}} seen the film The Man Who Laughs. Giordano's invitation led directly to Bolland working with writer Alan Moore to create a plausible background story for the Joker.

2500|$|Due to the film's success, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick {{have planned}} a {{possible}} sequel, with many more ideas {{they want to}} explore. [...] "We would love it, and everybody involved creatively wants to do another one", said Wernick.

[...] The actor himself said, [...] "Am I into it? Who wouldn't be? I don't think that's reality. It's a fun rumor." [...] Ford said he would return for a fifth film {{if it does not}} take another twenty years to develop, while Spielberg responded it would happen [...] "only if you [...] want more".

2500|$|In 2002, the Cartoon Network {{acquired}} syndication {{rights to}} Futurama and Family Guy, another animated show Fox had canceled, for its Adult Swim block.

In 2005, Comedy Central entered negotiations {{to take over the}} syndication rights, during which they discussed the possibility of producing new episodes. In 2006, it was announced that four straight-to-DVD films would be produced, and later split into 16 episodes comprising a fifth season of the show.

Thomas Tull said, 'I {{would love to see}} Hellboy 3.' He didn't say he <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it he just said he'd like to see it, but today, I'll ask him." [...] Ron Perlman added his support for the idea, stating: [...] "Not just anybody can make this movie. I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on Pacific Rim was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen. My immediate, silent wish was, wouldn't it be great if these guys came in and helped resolve the Hellboy series." ...|$|E

One of Steve's friends, Trish (Frajko), says that some of the girls in her acting class <b>would</b> probably <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.
