5|$|In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the {{earliest}} Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes {{were involved in}} the trade of livestock, horses, fruit, and slaves, and <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to the Han because of their resources and metalworking expertise. Trade routes between Dian {{and the rest of the}} Han empire were opened up by Han soldiers. The Han continued their expansion northward, and annexed the territory near Shu.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to women because it offered {{professional}} opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E
5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; the idea of being in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E
5|$|Sally Jewell {{worked for}} Mobil oil company on oil fields in Oklahoma from 1978 through 1981, when she joined Rainier Bank and {{returned}} to the Pacific Northwest. Jewell's background <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to Rainier Bank, which was considering gas and oil investments and wanted engineers like Jewell to help evaluate possible assets. Jewell advised against investments in oil and gas, a move which proved beneficial for Rainier Bank. She stayed with Security Pacific after it acquired Rainier Bank, until 1992. Jewell then worked for WestOne Bank from 1992 through 1995, and for Washington Mutual from 1995 through 2000. Altogether she spent nearly 20 years working in the banking industry.|$|E

5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming rights}} of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the {{foundation}} that created the world’s famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed {{around the same time}} as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.|$|E
5|$|After {{these talks}} with Rudd, Lobengula called an indaba (conference) of over 100 izinDuna {{to present the}} {{proposed}} concession terms to them and gauge their sympathies. It {{soon became clear that}} opinion was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed to the idea of any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|In late 1108 {{or early}} 1109, Henry V, then the King of the Romans, sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote {{separately}} {{to her mother}} on the same matter. The match <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> to the English King: his daughter would be marrying {{into one of the}} most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France. In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor. The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October. She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) {{contemplated}} {{whether it}} would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect <b>was</b> <b>attractive.</b> The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance that politics should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} left Henry with no legitimate son, {{his various}} nephews now the closest male heirs. Henry {{announced he would}} take a new wife, Adeliza of Louvain, opening up {{the prospect of a}} new royal son, and the two were married at Windsor Castle in January 1121. Henry appears to have chosen her because she <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> and came from a prestigious noble line. Adela seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child. The White Ship disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by Maredudd ap Bleddyn. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although the King was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.|$|E
5|$|After Coates left, the {{orchestra}} reverted to its preferred practice of engaging numerous guest conductors {{rather than a}} single principal conductor. Among the guests were Elgar, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin. Revenues were substantial, and {{the orchestra}} seemed to many to be entering into a golden age. In fact, for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s, the LSO allowed its standards of playing to slip. In 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic, under Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London. Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways. In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. The prospect of joining a permanent, salaried orchestra <b>was</b> <b>attractive</b> enough to induce some LSO players to defect. The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that contrasted starkly with the severe press criticisms of the LSO's playing. According to the critic W J Turner the LSO's problem was not that its playing had deteriorated, but that it had failed {{to keep up with}} the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras.|$|E

25|$|Ward and {{his forces}} now gained a notoriety that {{attracted}} new recruits (for the pay <b>was</b> <b>attractive,</b> even if looting was discouraged by Ward), and enraged local Westerners who saw Ward as an inflammatory, filibustering element sure {{to force the}} Taipings {{to stop the flow}} of trade. More disconcertingly, the Taipings themselves were now aware of a new and potent force against them.|$|E

Brilliant Pebbles later became the centerpiece of a revised architecture under the Bush Administration SDIO.|$|E
