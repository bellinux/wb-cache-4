5|$|After ReaLemon met <b>with</b> <b>success</b> in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} it {{into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging to mislead consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E

In his book-length study of Méliès, the film historian John Frazer spoke highly of the film, noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Méliès made another film in a similar vein, Le Raid New York–Paris en automobile, in 1908; it was also received <b>with</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in February 1945, operating around Istria and Dalmatia, where Germany still held {{portions of the}} mainland and certain strategic islands. The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night, close to shore, and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets.

5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{mechanics of}} the original game remain the same. The player controls an empire {{with the goal of}} conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, <b>with</b> <b>success</b> or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other.|$|E

The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected.

5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; <b>with</b> <b>success</b> being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time <b>with</b> <b>success.</b> Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{first heard}} of the Báb when he was 27, and {{received}} a visitor sent by the Báb, Mullá Husayn, telling him of the Báb and his claims. Bahá'u'lláh became a Bábí and helped to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of Núr, where he became {{recognized as one of}} its most influential believers. His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met <b>with</b> <b>success,</b> even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as Táhirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping. Bahá'u'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of Khorasan, where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Bahá'u'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bahá'u'lláh took on the name Bahá.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, M3 GMCs {{were being}} used by tank {{destroyer}} battalions in the North African Campaign, each of which consisted of 36 M3s and four 37mm M6 GMCs. The M3 GMCs, which were designed for ambushing tanks, proved to be inadequate for this task in the battles of Sidi Bou Zid and Kasserine Pass, mainly due to poor tactics. Nevertheless, the M3 was later used in the Battle of El Guettar <b>with</b> <b>success,</b> claiming 30 German tanks, including possibly two Tiger tanks, {{at the cost of}} 21 M3s. Some M3s also saw service in Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), but by that time, the M10 tank destroyer had replaced it in the U.S. Army. A total of 1,360 M3 GMCs were also converted back into M3A1 half-tracks.|$|E

In 1905, he consultated up to 400 patients per day. Around the same time, he published a four-page leaflet which commented passages of the Gospels without reference to Spiritism.|$|E
5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead and the few German defenders held fast in a single office building, protected by a canal {{in front of them}} and covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met <b>with</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
