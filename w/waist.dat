5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that {{have given rise to}} its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It in turn is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their <b>waist.</b> The <b>waist</b> is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.|$|E

5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in <b>waist</b> mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size, while the <b>waist</b> guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the <b>waist,</b> to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the <b>waist</b> with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E

40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{demonstration and}} modeling of the optimization of a phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifier by tuning the relative position between the pump- and signal-beam <b>waists</b> along the propagation direction. At the optimum position, the pump beam focuses after the signal beam, and this departure from co-located <b>waists</b> increases with increasing pump power. Such optimization {{leads to more}} than 3 dB improvement in the measured de-amplification response of the amplifier. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Reversible lens system {{provides}} two velocity ranges. Laser velocimeter modified to provide two velocity ranges by adding rotatable assembly containing two lenses. In one orientation, beam <b>waists</b> narrow, and two beams intersect at relatively large angle, providing low velocity range with high spatial resolution. In reversed orientation beam <b>waists</b> are wider, and beams intersect at smaller angle to produce more-widely-spaced fringes in larger region, providing high velocity range with lower spatial resolution...|$|R

Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her <b>waist.</b> Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg.

5000|$|I {{find that}} {{girls who have}} {{commenced}} the use of stays at an early age, and become gradually used to them, do not experience any uneasiness when they are worn tighter at fourteen or fifteen. There {{can be no doubt}} that a slender figure is as much admired as ever, and always will be so. The present fashion of short <b>waists</b> is admitted on all hands to be very ugly, and will soon go out. Those girls, then, who have not had their figures properly attended to while growing will be unable to reduce their <b>waists</b> when the fashion changes, whereas, by proper care now, they will be able to adopt the fashion of longer <b>waists</b> without any inconvenience. I trust you will allow us schoolmistresses fair play in this important matter, and insert this, or part of it, in your Magazine.|$|R

The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments.
