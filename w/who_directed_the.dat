5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Fantastic Four {{film was}} the weakest {{reviewed}} of the series; it was criticised for its dark, humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story.

5|$|An eighth {{installment}} was planned, but {{the decrease}} in the box office performance for Saw VI compared to previous installments led to Saw 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for Saw VIII being incorporated into Saw 3D. Saw V director David Hackl was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming Lionsgate announced that Greutert, <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> sixth film, would direct. Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton {{to give the impression}} that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members would go on to direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>The</b> Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without {{expressions}} of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate {{to express my}} opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E

5|$|St. Elmo is a 1914 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company and distributed by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company. It was the first feature-length film adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name.

5|$|The Duke's {{return to}} favour under the House of Hanover {{enabled him to}} preside over {{the defeat of the}} 1715 Jacobite rising from London (although it was his former assistant, Cadogan, <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> operations). But his health was fading, and on 28 May 1716 (O.S.), shortly {{after the death of his}} {{daughter}} Anne, Countess of Sunderland, he suffered a paralytic stroke at Holywell House. This was followed by another, more severe stroke in November, this time at a house on the Blenheim estate. The Duke recovered somewhat, but while his speech had become impaired his mind remained clear, recovering enough to ride out to watch the builders at work on Blenheim Palace and attend the Lords to vote for Oxford's impeachment.|$|E
5|$|Walsingham {{rose from}} {{relative}} obscurity {{to become one}} of the small coterie <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> Elizabethan state, overseeing foreign, domestic and religious policy. He served as English ambassador to France in the early 1570s and witnessed the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. As principal secretary, he supported exploration, colonization, the use of England's maritime strength and the plantation of Ireland. He worked to bring Scotland and England together. Overall, his foreign policy demonstrated a new understanding of the role of England as a maritime, Protestant power in an increasingly global economy. He oversaw operations that penetrated Spanish military preparation, gathered intelligence from across Europe, disrupted a range of plots against Elizabeth and secured the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, another {{installment}} of the franchise was pitched by executive producers Howard Gordon, Evan Katz, Manny Coto and Brian Grazer, which would revolve around a stable of supporting characters rather than Kiefer Sutherland in the lead role. In January 2016, Fox announced it had ordered a pilot for a spin-off series titled 24: Legacy, which would feature a new cast, with no returning characters except Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard). The series retains the real-time format, however, consists of 12 episodes, using time jumps to cover the events of a single day. Stephen Hopkins, <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> original 24 pilot and several first-season episodes, directed the Legacy pilot. Jon Cassar also returned to direct and produce 6 of the 12 episodes. Corey Hawkins and Miranda Otto play the two lead characters; Hawkins as Eric Carter, a military hero returning home; and Otto as Rebecca Ingram, a former head of CTU. The pilot was officially ordered to series in April 2016 and premiered on February 5, 2017, immediately after Super Bowl LI. In June 2017, the series was canceled after one season.|$|E

5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> band into the studio now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|John Harmen Marburger III (February 8, 1941 – July 28, 2011) was an American {{physicist}} <b>who</b> <b>directed</b> <b>the</b> Office of Science and Technology Policy in {{the administration}} of President George W. Bush, serving as the Science Advisor to the President. His tenure was marked by controversy regarding his defense of the administration against allegations from over two dozen Nobel Laureates, amongst others, that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, including those relating to stem cell research and global warming. However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government. He also served as the President of Stony Brook University from 1980 until 1994, and director of Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1998 until 2001.|$|E
