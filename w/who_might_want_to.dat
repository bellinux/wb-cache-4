500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was the sort of person <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard's {{early work}} was written under various pseudonyms {{that he used}} to present {{distinctive}} viewpoints and to interact with each other in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote many Upbuilding Discourses under his own name and dedicated them to the [...] "single individual" [...] <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> discover the meaning of his works. Notably, he wrote: [...] "Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject." [...] While scientists can learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation could reveal {{the inner workings of the}} world of the spirit.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{according}} to older SOCs is often reserved for transsexual people only, not for other transgender people, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> undergo the {{complete set of}} treatments, or who see themselves outside a binary gender system. Such older SOCs are often used to withhold medical interventions from transgender people altogether.|$|R
50|$|An {{interest}} graph is {{an online}} {{representation of the}} specific things in which an individual is interested.Interest graphs have perceived utility and value because of the premise that people’s interests are a major aspect of who they are, forming part of their personal identity, {{and can be used}} as indicators of such things as what they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do or buy, where they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go, or <b>who</b> they <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> meet, follow or vote for.|$|R
5000|$|The label {{was founded}} in 1999 by Ben Dickey when he was 17 years old. [...] This was Dickey's second label, having {{previously}} founded Peek-A-Boo Records [...] It was Dickey's intent to provide local support to Austin bands <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> release with a geographically remote independent label. [...] The label expanded to include band that were not from the Austin area.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the second}} Smashing Pumpkins album {{released}} for free over the Internet, the first being 2000's Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music. [...] Teargarden is seeing such a release due to Corgan's reported hope that people hear the album before dismissing it, {{on top of his}} interest in [...] "subverting a system that works against holistic thinking when it comes to how art is made and delivered to those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear it." [...] All of the songs were planned to be released for free as 192-kbps, DRM-free MP3 files, available from direct links on the band's website. Finally, a complete box set release is planned that will contain all of the tracks accompanied by an art film and a making-of documentary. [...] Corgan says he is also considering a single-CD compilation of the best of the forty-four tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Often a {{separate}} institution, called a special purpose vehicle, is created {{to handle the}} securitization of asset backed securities. [...] The special purpose vehicle, which creates and sells the securities, uses the {{proceeds of the sale}} to pay back the bank that created, or originated, the underlying assets. [...] The special purpose vehicle is responsible for [...] "bundling" [...] the underlying assets into a specified pool that will fit the risk preferences and other needs of investors <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy the securities, for managing credit risk – often by transferring it to an insurance company after paying a premium – and for distributing payments from the securities. [...] As long as the credit risk of the underlying assets is transferred to another institution, the originating bank removes the value of the underlying assets from its balance sheet and receives cash in return as the asset backed securities are sold, a transaction which can improve its credit rating and reduce the amount of capital that it needs. [...] In this case, a credit rating of the asset backed securities would be based only on the assets and liabilities of the special purpose vehicle, and this rating could be higher than if the originating bank issued the securities because the risk of the asset backed securities would no longer be associated with other risks that the originating bank might bear. [...] A higher credit rating could allow the special purpose vehicle and, by extension, the originating institution to pay a lower interest rate (and hence, charge a higher price) on the asset-backed securities than if the originating institution borrowed funds or issued bonds.|$|E

Fred Moffatt is a survivor - just. Bearded, wearing a battered hat and a crumpled suit, his car a rusting wreck, he runs a struggling engineering firm and is constantly trying to avoid his creditors, the tax man, the bank manager, and indeed anyone <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> pay for something.|$|R
5000|$|Greenberg {{told his}} cops that their job {{was not to}} punish (that {{was up to the}} courts), but to make arrests, and {{in order to do that}} they had to be on good terms with the citizens. So he put his cops out on the streets, not in cars. They walked, rode {{bicycles}} and horses, and were accessible to [...] "normal people," [...] <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call or visit headquarters.|$|R

50|$|Rhode Island {{was one of}} {{the last}} states to admit women to the bar. Even with the {{progress}} Sawyer made for women, it was not until 1974 that the number of woman lawyers in Rhode Island really increased. In fact, Sawyer was the only woman lawyer in Rhode Island for quite some time. Ada believed that this was because Percy kept a position aside for her and helped her study for the bar, unlike most other women <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have become lawyers.|$|R

2500|$|Amos, who has {{struggled}} with and fought her religious upbringing, both through her music and with her own mosaic set of beliefs, approached the prospect of doing a holiday album, or seasonal record, {{from the perspective of}} someone who was struggling to gain a deep and enriching spirituality not necessarily tied to a set of dogmatic beliefs: [...] "I felt that as a minister’s daughter I could open up the circle to all those people <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> embrace Christianity, but have a spiritual feeling about the time.|$|R

Patricia then tells Carella that it was Andrew who had murdered Muriel, his motive being {{that she had been}} sleeping with him but left him for her married boss, and had tried to kill Patricia as the only witness.

30|$|An {{influential}} {{simulation of}} the social factors of peer review was reported by Thurner and Hanel (2011), where the authors studied the effect of rational reviewers, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see high quality work better than their own published or promoted, with an agent-based model. They found out that {{a small fraction of}} incorrect reviewers is sufficient to drastically lower the quality of the accepted publications. They showed how a simple quality-increasing policy can lead to additional loss in overall scientific quality. The same model was applied in Roebber and Schultz (2011), where the authors focused on funding requests instead of peer review of papers.|$|R
5000|$|Nobumasa's {{placement}} at Kanō {{was meant}} {{to act as a}} check against the potentially hostile lords of the west, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> march eastward against Ieyasu. Nobumasa retired in 1602, handing over the position of daimyo to his son Okudaira Tadamasa; however, he retained 40,000 of the domain's 100,000 koku as a [...] "retirement fund", and continued to hold actual power, establishing a system of flood control and better aiding in the setup of the castle town. Nobumasa and Tadamasa died in quick succession; the third Okudaira lord of Kanō, Tadataka, died heirless in 1632, and so the Okudaira rule in Kanō came to an end.|$|R

40|$|Every {{good idea}} begins somewhere. (Sometimes it begins {{in many places}} {{at the same time}} - such {{confluence}} being the hallmark of cogent currents of contemporary thought.) The symposium that gave rise to this festschrift for Frank Michelman took its cue from a symposium held at Harvard Law School earlier in 2012 to acknowledge his astonishing career. Professor Drucilla Cornell recognised early on that many South African legal scholars and jurists <b>who</b> <b>might</b> have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> attend the symposium would be unable to do so. She suggested that we might hold a similar symposium here in South Africa and threw her considerable weight behind the endeavour. Of course, no symposium would have been possible had Professor Michelman himself not been willing to undertake the journey to this home away from home. [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{opposition}} is denouncing unfair pressure {{by the government}} against those governmental workers <b>who</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> support the president. They released a video that showed energy minister and head of PDVSA, Rafael Ramírez, telling state oil workers to back President Hugo Chávez or to leave their jobs. He also said PDVSA is red [...] "from top to bottom"(PDVSA es roja, rojita de arriba abajo). He also said that PDVSA's [...] "workers are with this revolution, and those who aren't should go somewhere else. Go to Miami". Opposition media outlets have been repeating the 14-minute video over and over again. President Chávez said he supported the PDVSA director and recommended {{him to make the}} same speech to oil workers 100 times a day.The CNE opened an investigation into Rafael Ramírez following the protests from the opposition and Ramírez was eventually fined.|$|R
