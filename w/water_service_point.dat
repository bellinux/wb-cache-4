40|$|Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) to {{supplement}} <b>service</b> <b>water</b> {{is an important}} aspect of sustainable development. As such, much research has been carried out on optimizing the system components of RWH systems so that a maximum water saving efficiency (WSE) can be reached with a minimum storage capacity, enabling the outlay on capital minimized. However, if RWH is to proliferate it should be able to operate in par with centralized <b>service</b> <b>water,</b> supplying collected rain water to user points reliably. This is usually achieved by pumping the collected rain <b>water</b> to <b>service</b> <b>points</b> utilizing electricity, which in fact could negate the positive gains of RWH with regard to principles of sustainability. By introducing a multi tank model, where a smaller tank is installed for each floor at its roof level in addition to the main storage tank, a solution can be reached with superior system performance. In the model, the roof collection enters the top most tank first and then cascades through multiple tanks in multi story situations, before being collected in the main storage tank, vastly improving the overall energy efficiency of the system. The model, not only addresses the space and structural issues of the building but also ensures that the aesthetics of the building envelop is not disturbed due to smaller sizes of the upper tanks...|$|R

40|$|Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) is {{an ancient}} civil {{practice}} of more than 4000 years, drawing attention among scientists in recent decades, {{in the light of}} potable water shortages and water based natural disasters such as draughts and flash floods. It is noted that much focus has been on optimizing the sizes and operation of individual components, in relation to increased Water Saving Efficiency (WSE), in order to minimize he overall capital investment. However, if RWH is to proliferate, it should function on par with centralized <b>service</b> <b>water</b> supply, particularly in delivering <b>water</b> to <b>service</b> <b>points</b> reliably. This is most relevant in urban, multi story scenarios, where not only service reliability but optimized utilization of space and aesthetic aspects is also important. Taking in to consideration that pumping of collected rain water is energy consuming and therefore against the principles of sustainability, a Cascading Multi Tank Rain Water Harvesting (CMTRWH) system is introduced for multi story situations, where the energy requirement on pumping is much less compared to the conventional models. Even though the CMTRWH model is energy efficient, unless an alternative, renewable power source is introduced to operate an efficient pump with total reliability, the system will have to depend on costly grid power, not only negating the positive impact of using RWH on sustainable development, but also depriving water security to vast communities of people without access to grid power. Sri Lanka being a tropical country, solar power option is pursued as the most desirable alternative energy source. Acknowledging the importance of a storage battery for the reliable operation of the power supply system, sizing curves are developed to select optimally matching pair of PV generator and battery for a given load, at a given location. In order to overcome the difficulty of obtaining measured incident solar radiation at remote locations, a methodology is developed to calculate solar radiation using easily obtainable rainfall data.

According to section 11 of the <b>Water</b> <b>Services</b> Act 108 of 1997, every <b>Water</b> <b>Service</b> Authority has a duty to all consumers or potential consumers in the area of jurisdiction to progressively ensure efficient, affordable, economical and sustainable access to <b>water</b> <b>services.</b> In response to this obligation the Mopani District Municipality appointed all five local municipalities as <b>water</b> <b>service</b> providers. In addition, the Mopani District Municipality has signed a bulk water supply agreement with the Lepelle Northern Water Board {{in the area of the}} Ba-Phalaborwa and Greater Letaba municipalities based on the fact that the board has the abstraction license and the bulk infrastructure for purifying water.

This paper provides a theory-informed {{account of the}} way in which <b>water</b> <b>service</b> provision has been physically and institutionally restructured in the Algarve, Portugal over the years. Ever-expanding demands for <b>water</b> <b>services</b> by the tourism sector, along with European Union (EU) regulations and money, made the local people dependent on national policy for <b>water</b> <b>service</b> provision. Parts of the Portuguese national elite, favouring the construction of water resources as "strategic", "social" goods rather than "economic", "scarce" goods, worked towards installing national level control over <b>water</b> <b>services.</b> They became part of the state’s decentralised hegemonic spatial strategy for expansion of tourism in the Algarve. The district level was constituted as a decentralised level of national resource governance. The case study shows the role of European policies in restructuring the spatio-temporal order in the Algarve and strengthening the influence of the national state within the region. The reconfiguration of the water sector in Portugal illustrates 'Spatial Keynesianism' with half-hearted mercantilisación of <b>water</b> <b>services</b> as an outcome of a juxtaposition of a nationally rooted state-led <b>water</b> <b>service</b> provision within more flexible approaches originating at the European level.
