5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old,</b> although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in Man of the People (1937), a political drama about a young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E

The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E

The ship was hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb, Able, and was left heavily damaged and radioactive. Unfit for further service, Nevada was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk for naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 Democratic National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running mate {{in the presidential election}} that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old.</b> Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Hawks made Hatari!, {{again with}} John Wayne, {{who plays a}} big-game hunter in Africa. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, Man's Favorite Sport?, {{starring}} Rock Hudson (since Cary Grant felt he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with Red Line 7000 in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks's final two films were both Western remakes of Rio Bravo starring John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed El Dorado, starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made Rio Lobo, with Wayne in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and {{underwent}} further refitting from 1939 to 1943.

For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.|$|E
5|$|Returning to London {{later in}} 1953 Gielgud took over {{management}} of the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a classical season of Richard II, Congreve's The Way of the World, and Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd, directing the first, acting in the last, and doing both in the second. Feeling he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for Richard, he cast the young Paul Scofield; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success. During the season Gielgud was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Wheeler {{retired from}} his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology. Childe was also retiring {{from his position}} of director that year, and Wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him. Wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of W.F. Grimes, deeming his career undistinguished; instead, he championed Glyn Daniel as a candidate, although ultimately Grimes was selected. That year, Wheeler's marriage broke down, and he moved from his wife's house to a former brothel at 27 Whitcomb Street in central London. From 1954 to 1959, he served as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, and after resigning supported Ian Richmond as his replacement; however, Joan Evans was selected. From 1964 to 1966 he served as Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board, stepping down when he concluded that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the role.|$|E
5|$|In March 1999, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} their teaming with Dodd Darin on a biopic, with collaboration from producer Arthur Friedman, {{who had been}} developing both The Bobby Darin Story and Dreamer with Levinson at Warner Bros. since 1986. Shortly afterwards, Spacey was in discussions with Dodd Darin to star in the lead role. Spacey was able to acquire the film rights from Warner Bros. in early 2000. With the help of Dodd Darin, the actor also received exclusive music rights for no charge. With his Academy Award-winning performance in American Beauty (1999), Paramount Pictures became interested in distributing/financing Beyond the Sea. The deal fell apart when Paramount told Spacey was that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the role and instead wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Beginning in October 2000, Spacey took vocal training lessons from Darin collaborator Roger Kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of the singer.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started Jim <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to {{be called}} up for active service, as well as having {{previously}} been disqualified on medical grounds after falling from a wall and smashing his left eardrum when 10 years old. After the cotton exchange closed {{for the duration of}} the war, Jim worked as an inspector at Napier's engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives. He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes. After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's Cleansing Department before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.|$|E

5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to this marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and even of higher social standing. They thought he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for their daughter, {{and that she was}} too young to marry. Perhaps Sophia Brittan did not want to lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertaining guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. Despite parental objections, an engagement was announced, soon after which Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, requiring a move to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, after which the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers {{who were on the}} verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old.</b> Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he handed it over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E
5|$|His lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, felt Hess <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> {{and frail}} to {{have managed to}} kill himself. Wolf Rüdiger Hess {{repeatedly}} claimed {{that his father had}} been murdered by the British Secret Intelligence Service to prevent him from revealing information about British misconduct during the war. Abdallah Melaouhi, who served as Hess's medical orderly from 1982 to 1987, was dismissed from his position at his local district parliament's Immigration and Integration Advisory Council after he wrote a self-published book on a similar theme. According to an investigation by the British government in 1989, the available evidence did not back up the claim that Hess was murdered, and Solicitor General Sir Nicholas Lyell saw no grounds for further investigation. Moreover, the autopsy results support the conclusion that Hess had killed himself. A report released in 2012 again raised the question of whether Hess was murdered. Historian Peter Padfield claims the suicide note found on the body appears to have been written when Hess was hospitalised in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Steiger {{played a}} chauvinistic big game hunter, {{explorer}} and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson's Happy Birthday, Wanda June, before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone's Duck, You Sucker!, which was alternatively titled A Fistful of Dynamite. Leone was initially dissatisfied with {{his performance in}} that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned {{for the role of}} Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> for the part and rejected him.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>old</b> to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
