5|$|Under {{the prior}} CBA, players {{could not be}} traded until after the lockout was resolved, meaning Roberto Luongo could not be moved. Once a new CBA was reached, the trade rumors returned, {{including}} one that alleged Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke was fired {{in order to help}} facilitate a trade. For his part, Luongo reiterated {{that he was willing to}} remain with the Canucks for the shortened season, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> long-term.|$|E
5|$|After the season, it {{was rumored}} that the Redskins were {{interested}} in promoting him to replace head coach Turk Edwards, but the franchise denied it and Shaughnessy {{would not comment on}} his plans. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> athletic director or resign from the Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and might return to coach only college football {{at the end of his}} term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd affirmed that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not related to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E

Accordingly, Brazil did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> isolated.|$|E

25|$|Stokes {{returned}} to England in 1857, where he married his cousin Julia. He {{returned to}} the Swan River Colony with his pregnant wife, however she died after giving birth. Stokes quickly lost his interest in brewing and died in 1861. The brewery continued to be operated by Henry Saw and William Meloy, who {{had worked in the}} business for many years and to whom Stokes had bequeathed interests in the business. Saw died in November 1870, and since Meloy did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the operation, the lease over the brewery was advertised.|$|E
25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} {{rate of descent}} and ascent {{in the water and}} be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E

The couple divorced, however, since Ji planned to stay in China, where Harriet did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> Ji traveled to Australia in 1948 as an advisor to the Nationalist delegation at the United Nations Economic Council, and on his return to China was made economic advisor to Nationalist General Fu Zuoyi, a fellow Shanxi native. Ji and his father were among the intellectuals who persuaded Fu to peacefully surrender the city to the communist armies. Ji met with Fu at their Beijing home as part of the ultimately successful effort. After 1949, Ji Gongquan continued his national and provincial educational and legal activities under the new government.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of them <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

500|$|On 31 December 1985, de Freitas went to New Orleans {{with the}} road crew on a drug binge and there {{announced}} his resignation from the band. Hence, the band faced 1986 with a commitment to record an album, but without their drummer—a musician who was considered fundamental to the band's creative success. They hired former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham for the spring 1986 tour of the United States; however, he didn't fit in, and after the tour left to join The Pretenders. The band then hired former ABC drummer David Palmer, and recorded a few sessions with producer Gil Norton for the new album. However, Palmer decided by July 1986 {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> with the band. As he left the band, de Freitas returned to the United Kingdom and expressed a wish to rejoin. Uncertain of de Freitas's commitment to the band, and his fragile mental state, they took him back as a hired hand rather than a full member. Now with the line-up that would record Echo & the Bunnymen, the band gave a live television appearance for the BBC in September 1986 when they played two new songs, [...] "The Game" [...] and [...] "Lips Like Sugar". According to Will Sergeant, the band were under pressure from Warner Music chairman Rob Dickins to produce an album that would replicate the success of Peter Gabriel's recent number one album So: [...] "I couldn't believe it when Rob Dickins brought us into his office and played us Peter Gabriel's album: 'I want you to sound like this!' I think he escaped with his life that day." ...|$|E
