5|$|Mr. Krabs {{is about}} to give SpongeBob and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, {{dropping}} the paint and says all 13 swear words while complaining about his foot being injured. When SpongeBob and Patrick hear all the swear words, they run to Mama Krabs' house to tattle on him. When they all reach her house, they all explain what happened at once, saying the same swear words in the process. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. Krabs scolds SpongeBob and Patrick for saying all those bad words {{in front of her}} she regains consciousness. Mama Krabs states that all three of them should be ashamed for saying all those <b>words.</b> <b>She</b> then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment. Later on, she leaves the three alarmed when she appears to be saying a 14th swear word after stubbing her toe on a rock; she claims that the sound came from Old Man Jenkins, who is driving by in his jalopy, which produces an identical sound and everyone laughs.|$|E
25|$|Priaulx Rainier died on 10 October 1986 at Besse-en-Chandesse in France, aged 83. The {{date was}} the 70th {{birthday}} of David Gascoyne, the poet to whose <b>words</b> <b>she</b> had written her Requiem of 1956.|$|E
25|$|Johanna Mattissen {{suggests}} that polysynthetic languages can be fundamentally {{divided into two}} typological categories, which differ in the way morphemes are organised to form <b>words.</b> <b>She</b> calls the two types for affixal and compositional polysynthesis respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Prose {{encourages}} {{the reader to}} slow down and read every <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> reminds the reader that words are the [...] "raw material out of which literature is crafted." [...] Challenging the reader to stop at every <b>word,</b> <b>she</b> suggests the following question be asked: [...] "What is the writer trying to convey with this word?" ...|$|R

25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let me {{tell you}} (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story in her own words, in the literal sense that she can use only the <b>words</b> <b>she</b> is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of events leading up to {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Walker was, {{as some of}} Hazlitt's friends could see, {{a fairly}} {{ordinary}} girl. She had aspirations to better herself, and a famous author seemed like a prize catch, but she never really understood Hazlitt. When another lodger named Tomkins came along, she entered into a romantic entanglement with him as well, leading each of her suitors {{to believe he was}} the sole object of her affection. With vague <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> evaded absolute commitment until she could decide which she liked better or was the more advantageous catch.|$|E
25|$|Having no clue {{as where}} Serena might be, Nate sends Gossip Girl the video he had of her obtaining in {{exchange}} the location where Serena is. The group goes at {{the location and}} finds Serena {{who goes by the}} name of Sabrina and has a new boyfriend, Steven (Barry Watson). As it looks like a wedding will take place and that Serena is the one who is getting married, Blair and Georgina tell the truth about who Serena is, ruining the wedding of two men; Serena was only a maid of honor. Blair apologizes to Serena for the mean <b>words</b> <b>she</b> said to her months ago but she responds that she wants a fresh start with Steven.|$|E

25|$|When Genie {{left the}} Riglers' house in mid-1975, {{at the age}} of 18, she had {{acquired}} a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. The <b>words</b> <b>she</b> learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and her progress remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. And how much of what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.|$|E
25|$|By April and May 1971, Genie's {{scores on}} the Leiter International Performance Scale tests had {{dramatically}} increased, with her overall mental age {{at the level of}} a typical 4-year-9-month-old, but on individual components she still showed a very high level of scatter. Her progress with language accelerated, and doctors noticed that the <b>words</b> <b>she</b> used indicated a fairly advanced mental categorization of objects and situations and focused on objective properties to a degree not normally found in children. Around that time, when a minor earthquake struck Los Angeles, she ran frightened into the kitchen and rapidly verbalized to some of the hospital cooks she had befriended, marking the first time she sought out comfort from another person and the first time she was so readily verbal. However, she still had a hard time being with large crowds of people; at her birthday party, she became so anxious at all the guests present that she had to go outside with Rigler to calm down.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
60|$|Without a <b>word</b> <b>she</b> {{came back}} to her work, and possessed her soul in patience.|$|R
60|$|In his {{intoxication}} he crept closer {{with every}} <b>word</b> <b>she</b> uttered, with every movement she made.|$|R

25|$|Another major {{aspect of}} the {{gameplay}} is the alethiometer, (a rare truth-telling device which features in the novels). Once the player {{has access to the}} Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically as the plot advances, others must be sought out by the player and can be missed. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the hand automatically turns to the correct symbol. <b>Words</b> <b>she</b> doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified {{in the first part of}} the game, the easier the balancing game is. If the player successfully completes the balancing game, the Alethiometer will answer the question.|$|E
500|$|Eilley Bowers {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most famous of 19th-century female pioneers, and a major figure in the early history of Nevada. In one writer's <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> [...] "is one of the most researched, written and talked about women in Nevada history." ...|$|E
500|$|Kipling {{began working}} on the book by telling the first three {{chapters}} as bedtime stories to his daughter Josephine. These had to be told [...] "just so" [...] (exactly in the <b>words</b> <b>she</b> was used to) or she would complain. The stories describe how one animal or another acquired its most distinctive features, such as how the Leopard got his spots. For the book, Kipling illustrated the stories himself.|$|E

500|$|Needham {{was taken}} from the pillory alive, but died on 3 May 1731, the day before she was due to stand in the pillory (this time at New Palace Yard) for the second time. With her last <b>words</b> <b>she</b> {{apparently}} expressed great fear at having to stand in the pillory again after the severe punishment she had received the first time. The Grub Street Journal, the satirical journal allied with Alexander Pope and others of Hogarth's friends, sardonically reported that the populace [...] "acted very ungratefully, considering how much she had done to oblige them". Her demise was celebrated in a mocking rhyme: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{prominent}} {{theme in}} the novel is social relations {{in a society where}} gender is irrelevant; in Le Guin's <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> [...] "eliminated gender, {{to find out what was}} left". In her 1976 essay [...] "Is Gender Necessary?" [...] Le Guin wrote that the theme of gender was only secondary to the novel's primary theme of loyalty and betrayal. Le Guin revisited this essay in 1988, and stated that gender was central to the novel; her earlier essay had described gender as a peripheral theme because of the defensiveness she felt over using masculine pronouns for her characters.|$|E
500|$|Inside Soaps Sarah praised Metcalfe's {{performances}} as [...] "love cheat Mercedes", {{calling them}} [...] "stellar". On the character, a journalist from the Liverpool Echo said that [...] "she's got herself in to some ridiculous situations in the past, but mark Mercedes' <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> {{will not be}} pushed around". A writer for the Liverpool Daily Post commented that [...] "say what you like about Mercedes, but she's good at getting what she wants". The Wirral Newss Laura Cox called Mercedes' pairing with Riley [...] "Hollyoaks favourite on-off couple" [...] before dubbing the storyline [...] "dramatic". She added that the storyline [...] "kept viewers on tenterhooks".|$|E
60|$|Faith darkled in her {{corner and}} said not a <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> would NOT talk to this--this creature.|$|R
60|$|She took {{a yellow}} plum from the table. Gwen {{accepted}} {{it without a}} <b>word.</b> <b>She</b> was too much perplexed.|$|R

500|$|Once in the holodeck, the Doctor meets Freya (Marjorie Monaghan), a shieldmaiden, and {{introduces}} {{himself as}} [...] "Schweitzer". She takes {{him to the}} hall, where he is made to prove himself before the others, and after a celebratory meal and everyone has retired to separate rooms, she reappears and suggests that, in the cold of the night when the fire in his hearth has gone out, he ought to join her. Though he dismisses her advances, he relaxes his inhibition in later scenes. Later they are confronted by Unferth (Christopher Neame), who kills Freya. She dies in Schweitzer's arms. With her last <b>words</b> <b>she</b> speaks his name.|$|E
500|$|Robey {{made his}} {{television}} debut in August 1938 but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. [...] The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his [...] "comic quality" [...] was conveyed {{on the small}} screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty <b>words.</b> <b>She</b> felt that he should [...] "be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were [...] "really too slow for television".|$|E
500|$|She did {{not agree}} with {{allowing}} spiritual and magical techniques to transmit between different cultures, believing that to do so caused damage; she for instance cautioned against allowing Western esoteric teachings to be practiced in India because [...] "the Hindu dies readily from shock". Equally she strongly opposed the adoption of Asian religious techniques into Western esotericism, distancing herself from occultists who did so. In her <b>words,</b> <b>she</b> must [...] "recommend to the white races the traditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychic constitution". She nevertheless perceived value in Westerners studying Asian disciplines like Yoga on a theoretical level, so long as they eschewed any attempt to put these teachings into practice.|$|E
60|$|That was the question--WOHIN? Whither? WOHIN? What {{a lovely}} <b>word!</b> <b>She</b> NEVER wanted it answered. Let it chime for ever.|$|R
60|$|Memory was the <b>word</b> <b>she</b> used, {{as if all}} {{my youth}} were fled. I suppose I really am quite elderly.|$|R
60|$|Then {{taking my}} hand, without another <b>word</b> <b>she</b> turned and passed thence. As will be seen, {{she kept her}} oath.|$|R
