Later, when it was proved that the nature of light <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> <b>transverse</b> instead of longitudinal, Huygens' theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by Maxwell, Einstein and de Broglie, which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena. These theories were supported by the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent. The results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E

40|$|For {{scattering}} calculations involving nonspherical particles such as ice crystals, we {{show that}} the transverse wave condition is not applicable to the refracted electromagnetic wave {{in the context of}} geometric optics when absorption is involved. Either the TM wave condition (i. e., where the magnetic field of the refracted <b>wave</b> <b>is</b> <b>transverse</b> with respect to the wave direction) or the TE wave condition (i. e., where the electric field is transverse with respect to the propagating direction of the wave) may be assumed for the refracted wave in an absorbing medium to locally satisfy the electromagnetic boundary condition in the ray tracing calculation. The wave mode assumed for the refracted wave affects both the reflection and refraction coefficients. As a result, a nonunique solution for these coefficients is derived from the electromagnetic boundary condition. In this study we have identified the appropriate solution for the Fresnel reflection/refraction coefficients in light scattering calculation based on the ray tracing technique. We present the 3 x 2 refraction or transmission matrix that completely accounts for the inhomogeneity of the refracted wave in an absorbing medium. Using the Fresnel coefficients for an absorbing medium, we derive an asymptotic solution in an analytical format for the scattering properties of a general polyhedral particle. Numerical results are presented for hexagonal plates and columns with both preferred and random orientations. The asymptotic theory can produce reasonable accuracy in the phase function calculations in the infrared window region (wavelengths near 10 micron) if the particle size (in diameter) is on the order of 40 micron or larger. However, since strong absorption is assumed in the computation of the single-scattering albedo in the asymptotic theory, the single scattering albedo does not change with variation of the particle size. As a result, the asymptotic theory can lead to substantial errors in the computation of single-scattering albedo for small and moderate particle sizes. However, from comparison of the asymptotic results with the FDTD solution, it is expected that a convergence between the FDTD results and the asymptotic theory results can be reached when the particle size approaches 200 micron. We show that the phase function at side-scattering and backscattering angles is insensitive to particle shape if the random orientation condition is assumed. However, if preferred orientations are assumed for particles, the phase function has a strong dependence on scattering azimuthal angle. The single-scattering albedo also shows very strong dependence on the inclination angle of incident radiation with respect to the rotating axis for the preferred particle orientations...|$|E
