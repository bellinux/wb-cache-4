5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a <b>windowless</b> compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, {{called in}} the {{architect}} William Burn to build new stables {{to the east of}} the house, in collaboration with W. A. Nesfield, who had designed the parterres. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of Saint George and the Dragon dated c. 184957 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone orangery, with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and <b>windowless.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was <b>windowless</b> and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a <b>windowless</b> room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the kitchen is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E
25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned <b>windowless</b> room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the <b>windowless</b> room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the <b>windowless</b> room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the <b>windowless</b> room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the <b>windowless</b> room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E
25|$|At the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini {{unveiled}} the Aventador J – a roofless, <b>windowless</b> {{version of the}} Lamborghini Aventador. The Aventador J uses the same 700hp engine and seven-speed transmission as the standard Aventador.|$|E
25|$|A <b>windowless</b> {{object is}} {{an object that}} doesn't have its own window but it instead {{displayed}} in its container's window. It {{is used by the}} container to relay messages received by the container's window that are intended for the contained object. For example, if the mouse is moved over a window, Windows places a mouse move message along with the mouse coordinates in the message queue of the window. If this window contains <b>windowless</b> embedded objects, the message may have to be relayed to such an object if the coordinates of the mouse-pointer are over this object. For similar reasons this interface also provides access to the object's DropTarget interface.|$|E
25|$|The library's six-story {{above-ground}} {{tower of}} book stacks {{is surrounded by}} a <b>windowless</b> rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{are under}} {{constant}} surveillance, usually with closed-circuit television cameras. Cell doors are usually opaque, while the cells may be <b>windowless.</b> Conditions are plain, with poured concrete or metal furniture common. Cell walls, and sometimes plumbing, may be soundproofed to prevent {{communication between the}} inmates.|$|E
25|$|Specialized UV gas-discharge lamps {{containing}} different gases produce UV radiation {{at particular}} spectral lines for scientific purposes. Argon and deuterium arc lamps {{are often used}} as stable sources, either <b>windowless</b> or with various windows such as magnesium fluoride. These are often the emitting sources in UV spectroscopy equipment for chemical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the former}} RAF Ibsley is unrecognizable. The {{airfield}} consists mostly {{of a series}} of gravel pits and large landscaped lakes. One lake is overlooked by the derelict, <b>windowless</b> control tower. A very small section of the end of runway 01 still exists south of Ellingham Drive at {{the southern part of the}} airfield.|$|E
25|$|Suzanne Lachelier {{offered to}} wear a hood {{in order to be}} taken to him, but the camp {{authorities}} initially refused. She finally gained approval in 2008 to visit al-Shibh, together with her co-counsel. They traveled in a <b>windowless</b> van, which was used to transport prisoners. She was the first defense lawyer to visit Camp 7.|$|E
25|$|If a {{container}} wishes to support <b>windowless</b> embedded objects, {{it needs to}} provide functionality to embedded objects to replace the functionality normally provided by an embedded object's window. For example this interface provides a way to access the container's window's device context, thereby enabling the embedded object to draw in the container's window.|$|E
25|$|Geiger {{counters}} {{are widely}} used to detect gamma radiation, and for this the <b>windowless</b> tube is used. However, efficiency is generally low due to the poor interaction of gamma rays compared with alpha and beta particles. For instance, a chrome steel G-M tube is only about 1% efficient {{over a wide range}} of energies.|$|E
25|$|The building's long south facade {{stretches}} ten bays as {{the ground}} slopes toward the river. All of the south bays feature one over one single-hung sash windows on each story except for bays four, seven and eight, which are <b>windowless.</b> The south facade also features piers with iron buttresses {{as well as a}} third bay dock door.|$|E
25|$|DirectX 9 {{included}} VMR-9. This version uses Direct3D 9 {{instead of}} DirectDraw, allowing developers to transform video images using the Direct3D pixel shaders. It {{is available for}} all Windows platforms {{as part of the}} DirectX 9 redistributable. As VMR-7 it provides a <b>Windowless</b> Mode. However, unlike Overlay mixer or VMR-7 it does not support video ports. Using the /3GB boot option may cause VMR-9 to fail.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} Doctor Fate, known as Doc Fate, {{is shown to}} exist on the pulp fiction-influenced world of Earth-20. Doc Fate is an African-American gunslinger and occultist named Kent Nelson who is based in a <b>windowless</b> Manhattan skyscraper. Doc Fate forms and leads a team of adventurers known as the Society of Super-Heroes, which consists of the Immortal Man, the Mighty Atom, the Blackhawks and the Green Lantern Abin Sur.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Berdella saw {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of the John Fowles book The Collector. The plot of this movie revolves around a lonely male who stalks, then abducts a young woman he finds attractive, and holds her captive in his <b>windowless,</b> stone basement, viewing her {{as little more than}} an attractive specimen. After several weeks, the female captive dies of a contracted illness despite her captor's efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.|$|E
25|$|The Alhóndiga de Granaditas is a {{very large}} {{building}} covering an entire block. It was originally built to store enough grain to feed the city for a year to protect the population against famines such as those that occurred in 1783, due to crop failure. This gave the building its name, which roughly translates to “house of grain.” The building is two floors, nearly <b>windowless</b> with a very large courtyard in its interior. Construction began in 1798 under an architect named Durán y Villaseñor and terminated under José del Mazo.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Plaxton {{responded to}} a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its {{contractors}} by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express' specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo etched into the fibre glass rear moulding. This period of coach design seemed to introduce the <b>windowless</b> rear as a design feature for most coaches.|$|E
25|$|Many port mills {{throughout}} the country sustained severe damage from bombing in the Second World War; almost 75 per cent of the national capacity was concentrated at the ports, which made them primary targets for air attacks. In London, Spillers' Millennium Mills as well as Rank's Premier Mills were substantially destroyed. Between 1945 and 1950 the ports underwent large-scale post-war reconstruction despite a deficit of raw materials and strict licensing. At this time Millennium Mills was rebuilt, including a <b>windowless</b> steel-framed infill on the west side, and was in operation by September 1953.|$|E
25|$|Eggleston's {{published}} {{books and}} portfolios, include Los Alamos (actually completed in 1974, before {{the publication of}} the Guide) the massive Election Eve (1976; a portfolio of photographs taken around Plains, Georgia before that year's presidential election); The Morals of Vision (1978); and Flowers (1978); Wedgwood Blue (1979); Seven (1979); Troubled Waters (1980); The Louisiana Project (1980). William Eggleston's Graceland (1984) is a series of commissioned photographs of Elvis Presley’s Graceland, depicting the singer’s home as an airless, <b>windowless</b> tomb in custom-made bad taste. Other series include The Democratic Forest (1989), Faulkner's Mississippi (1990), and Ancient and Modern (1992).|$|E
25|$|The front portico is a {{rectangular}} block {{attached to the}} tower that, on approach, gives {{the impression of a}} grand colonnade across the width of a tall ground floor. This is formed by a rhythmic series of white, smooth-rendered, rectangular concrete columns topped by a low parapet. This is in-filled with large panels of dark aluminium-framed inoperable glazing. The main elevation is symmetrical except for the entrance doors, which are placed off-centre. The <b>windowless</b> side elevations (east and west) of the portico are pale yellow facebrick walls in stretcher bond. The portico has a concealed flat roof clad with metal rib and pan sheeting.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{of retail}} {{friction}} models from the dealer promos were {{the lack of}} manufacturing paint schemes (they were simply molded in different colors, like many other promotionals) and usually had {{the addition of a}} friction motor located on the front axle, noticeable by the studded white vinyl gear that protruded around the axle (and through the oil pan)(see Gibson, p45). By contrast, the promo version often had a special lower engine plate that covered where the friction motor was placed on the commercial model. Early on, some cars, such as the 1953 Studebaker Commander promo, had the addition of acetate windows, while the friction powered model was <b>windowless</b> (Doty 2000b, p88).|$|E
25|$|Skyscrapers have {{considerable}} mass, {{which means that}} they must be built on a sturdier foundation than would be required for shorter, lighter buildings. Building materials must also be lifted {{to the top of a}} skyscraper during construction, requiring more energy than would be necessary at lower heights. Furthermore, a skyscraper consumes a lot of electricity because potable and non-potable water have to be pumped to the highest occupied floors, skyscrapers are usually designed to be mechanically ventilated, elevators are generally used instead of stairs, and natural lighting cannot be utilized in rooms far from the windows and the <b>windowless</b> spaces such as elevators, bathrooms and stairwells.|$|E
25|$|So the {{original}} equivalence principle, {{as described by}} Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a <b>windowless</b> room cannot distinguish between being {{on the surface of}} the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to tidal effects (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.|$|E
25|$|The Art Institute {{building}} has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect {{the east and}} west buildings while the Metra Electric and South Shore lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the <b>windowless</b> Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by Renzo Piano in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.|$|E
25|$|This tent is {{most often}} seen in a yellow/blue-grey stripe, but were also {{available}} in red/white, orange/blue, orange/white, and green/white. The tent's frame mounts to brackets {{on the roof and}} bumpers. The front bumper mount is a flat plate of steel bent into an open S or Z shape. Tent poles are steel, either black or grey, around 2cm in diameter, and there are fourteen sections that must be assembled to create a rectangular, peaked awning with support rods leading to the bumpers. Once the awning has been set up, curtains can be attached to the three outer sides (with Tenax lift-the-dot fasteners) to achieve a weatherproof - though <b>windowless</b> and floorless - portable shelter. Leather straps secure the sidewalls to the support poles, and stakes hold the bottom edges down as with the small tent. An additional set of poles and stakes were available to permit the outer flap to be extended horizontally as a second awning, resulting in a large shaded space {{on the side of the}} bus.|$|E
25|$|The walls {{surrounding}} the storages, stables and workshops of the Tre Kronor castle are now behind the Lejonbacken {{and in the}} basement of the northern row. Thus, Lejonbacken conceals the old <b>windowless</b> wall behind it. Older walls can also be found higher up in large parts of the northern row's facade walls. The walls from the former northeast and northwest square corner-towers for example, are thicker in this part of the palace's ground floor, since Tessin re-used the remaining walls and incorporated them in the new palace. About half of the old walls were used in that manner, since the ever frugal Charles XI had only reluctantly agreed to the conversion which started in 1690. Thrift and recycling were guiding principles at the building of the northern row. Hence, the construction proceeded rather quickly and after five months the new row was topped out and roofed. The new walls became higher that the old ones, except for the towers which were completely enclosed in the new walls. The Charles XI's Gallery is one more feature remaining since before the fire, all according to Tessin's plan.|$|E
25|$|Visitors would ascend the stairs, {{walk through}} the portal in the Portico and arrive in a {{vestibule}} which extended vertically for two storeys and was lit by a skylight in a coffered, oval domed ceiling. At night time the space was illuminated with gas lights with movable shades. The two flights of marble stairs united at a landing over which was a half dome. From there the stairs extended to running {{on both sides of}} the upper floor. The stair's balusters were of biscuit porcelain. The reception room to the left of the vestibule, extended the length of all five windows of the south wing and led to the ballroom, an octagonal room with four rounded niches in the corners. A skylight illuminated the <b>windowless</b> room with a similar gas lamp as the vestibule, providing nighttime lighting. The panelled north wall could be folded down into the adjoining lightwell such that it spanned the well. Again with a glass roof, the additional space was used to provide accommodation for musicians or other performers. The connecting drawing room linked the ballroom via a further anteroom, the former conservatory, with the great hall. This opulent room was built after the British bought the embassy. They employed August Orth to convert the old garden terrace on the west side of the building into a sumptuous state room. Paired marble corinthian pilasters and columns lined the walls and punctuated the glazing to the central courtyard and vaults rose over an entablature to support a flat ceiling decorated with rich ornamental carvings and painting. In 1877 the Berlin sculptor Otto Lessing created two stucco reliefs featuring dancing Maenads as part of the wall decoration for the great hall. Once again the lighting was provided by gas lamps with mobile shades integrated into the oval skylight, which simultaneously allowed ventilation.|$|E
500|$|The {{university}} rents {{space in}} Thompson Boat Center, {{though it has}} ongoing {{plans to build a}} new boathouse closer to campus. For land workouts, Georgetown rowers have access to the Rowing Training Center, a refurbished storeroom beneath the Leavey Center that was repurposed into an erg room in 2013 (its underground, <b>windowless</b> location has inspired numerous nicknames such as the [...] "Thunder Dungeon"). Notable Georgetown crew alumni include walk-on Mike Vespoli, the founder {{and chief executive officer of}} Vespoli USA, Inc. as well as actor Bradley Cooper.|$|E
500|$|The {{compound}} originally housed twelve royal tombs {{constructed in}} the style of Merina nobles, with a stone crypt topped by a small, <b>windowless</b> wooden house (tranomasina) indicative of aristocratic rank. The peaks of these tombs were aligned from north to south. Sovereigns originally buried in the four largest tombs, situated {{to the north of the}} others, included Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, Andriambelomasina, Andriampoinimerina, Ranavalona I and Ranavalona II, while the wives and relatives of sovereigns were buried in the smaller tombs. [...] According to oral histories, at its 19th-century peak the Ambohimanga compound contained 12 tombs.|$|E
500|$|What often {{finished}} {{them off}} was {{being forced to}} lie in the strong room, a <b>windowless</b> shed near the main sewer, next to piles of night soil and cadavers awaiting burial. Dickens described it as [...] "dreaded by even the most dauntless highwaymen and bearable only to toads and rats". One apparently diabetic army officer {{who died in the}} strong room—he had been ejected from the common side because inmates had complained about the smell of his urine—had his face eaten by rats within hours of his death, according to a witness.|$|E
500|$|In {{line with}} the film's use of {{practical}} locations, the photography and design departments worked together to incorporate practical light sources such as [...] "lots of bare bulbs, lots of primitive fixtures". In the climactic torture scene, filmed in an ancient, <b>windowless</b> prison cell outside of Rabat, they used only diegetic light: two strong torches carried by the actors playing the torturers. It was filmed with three cameras and bounce cards were used to reflect light onto the actors' faces. Just a little smoke was sprayed in to augment the atmosphere but not dull the contrast.|$|E
500|$|At {{its opening}} in 1950, the casino, at , {{was one of}} the largest in Nevada at the time. The <b>windowless</b> room {{included}} [...] "five crap tables, three roulette wheels, four black jack tables and 75 slot machines", together with a sportsbook. Hundreds of coin-operated gambling machines – including slot machines, video poker, 21, and keno – were installed during the 1978 renovation. The casino acquired a reputation for attracting the high rollers. On January 27, 2000, the Megabucks jackpot record for Las Vegas was broken when $34,955,489 was won by an anonymous gambler at the Desert Inn, playing a bank of six Megabucks machines near the hotel's coffee shop.|$|E
500|$|The Boston meetinghouse of the 1630s {{was small}} and <b>windowless,</b> with clay walls and a {{thatched}} roof—far different from his surroundings in the spacious and comfortable church of St. Botolph's. [...] Once established in his new church, Cotton's evangelical fervor brought about a religious revival, and there were more conversions during his first six months in the pastorate than {{there had been the}} previous year. [...] He was recognized as the leading intellectual in the colony, and is the first minister known to have preached a theme of millennialism in New England. [...] He also became the spokesman for the new church polity known as Congregationalism.|$|E
