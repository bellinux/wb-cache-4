5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} warhead, primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> Europe into seeking disarmament, {{in the belief that}} the bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was sold}} to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record {{transfer}} fee of £5,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding £5 million <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be £15,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001–02 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her {{purpose was}} to {{evacuate}} the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, the French and the Spanish. The government thought that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them - this, it was feared, <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> an outcry which might topple the government. Endeavour left England in January 1774, and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and a plaque.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm {{that he is}} operating the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates {{the circus}} and {{finds out that}} Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> Europe into seeking disarmament {{in the belief that}} the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realizes that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{was created}} as a kingdom on 16 December 1815, when Prince João, Prince of Brazil, who was then acting as regent for his ailing mother, Queen Maria, {{elevated}} the colony to a constituent country of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. While the royal court was still based in Rio de Janeiro, João ascended as king {{of the united kingdom}} the following year, and returned to Portugal in 1821, leaving his son, Prince Pedro, Prince of Brazil, as his regent in the Kingdom of Brazil. In September of that same year, the Portuguese parliament threatened to diminish Brazil back to the status of a colony, dismantle all the royal agencies in Rio de Janeiro, and demanded Pedro return to Lisbon. The Prince, however, feared these moves <b>would</b> <b>trigger</b> separatist movements and refused to comply; instead, at the urging of his father, he declared Brazil an independent Nation on 7 September 1822, leading to the formation of the Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. Prince Pedro became the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822, with the title of Pedro I (on that date, he was formally offered the Throne of the newly created Empire, accepted it, and was acclaimed as monarch), and his coronation took place on 1 December 1822. After Pedro abdicated the throne on 7 April 1831, the Brazilian empire saw only one additional monarch: Pedro II, who reigned for 58 years before a coup d'état overthrew the monarchy on 15 November 1889. There are two pretenders to the defunct Brazilian throne: Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, head of the Vassouras branch of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and, according to legitimist claims, de jure Emperor of Brazil; and Prince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza, head of the Petrópolis line of the Brazilian Imperial Family, and heir to the Brazilian throne according to royalists.|$|E
