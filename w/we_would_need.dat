25|$|The {{quantization}} of {{the volume}} proceeds {{the same way as}} with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the tangent vector , when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing.|$|E

500|$|Jeff {{has stated}} that {{starting}} from the album The Painful Experience they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call [...] "hybrid drums", a mix of real-time performance and software-based matrix programming. He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: [...] "About the drummer, it is still {{very hard to find}} a right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very extreme-metal with blast beats and fast double-kicks, to powerful rock beats that demand steady tempo, and to some polyrhythmic playing and time-signature shifts in the characteristics of jazz and prog drumming. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why the best thing for the recording is to make the hybrid drumming." [...] In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of The Habit of Fire, starting from collecting samples and creating MIDI information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals. Jeff also mentioned during the interview about the 2011 Futuride EP, that he has experimented with additive synthesis on the recent songs he has recorded and uses guitars to counterbalance the sounds generated by the additive synthesis.|$|E

Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: [...] "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [...] <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful." [...] Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women.

2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family.

They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E
2500|$|Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak (DFL) {{said that}} future needs and policy {{considerations}} shouldn't be {{ignored in the}} rush to build a replacement and sought a new bridge able to handle increased traffic as well as mass transit. Meetings between state transportation officials (Mn/DOT), Rybak, State Transportation Commissioner Carol Molnau, and Governor Tim Pawlenty yielded a desire to build a 10 lane bridge that will last 100 years, with the possibility of bus rapid transit or light rail lines. Rybak said, [...] "Transit needs to play some role in this or otherwise <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to build a much wider bridge in the future." [...] At a public forum in Roseville, hundreds of Twin Cities residents participated in a discussion about the bridge design. The overriding theme of the crowd was a desire to plan for the bridge's use of mass transit. Commissioner Molnau, in conjunction with Metropolitan Council Chairman Peter Bell, recommended that light rail not be incorporated in the new bridge design. [...] But Pawlenty, responding to constituents and the mayor, directed Mn/DOT to design the bridge to be light rail-ready. He said the estimated additional $20 to $35 million would be paid for by the state.|$|E
2500|$|The avenues {{from which}} teams {{acquired}} marquée talent started to close and DeWitt, recognizing {{that he needed}} to change his club's approach to stay competitive, went about [...] "abandoning a philosophy of chasing big names" [...] that had netted such stars as McGwire, Edmonds, Kile, Édgar Rentería and Rolen. [...] Said DeWitt, [...] "We had great teams in that era, but I knew that that wasn’t sustainable because as that group aged, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> younger players. [...] With the new labor agreement that was coming in, teams were holding on to their players." [...] He added, [...] "we were opportunistic prior to that by getting players from other clubs, but we made a conscious decision back in the ’03 and ’04 time frame {{that we were going to}} throw a lot of resources and make every effort to build from within ... Rather than giving up draft choices, we tried to accumulate draft choices." [...] To avert continual reliance on signing free agents and trading for stars already in their prime, DeWitt sought to place the expertise of people like Jeff Luhnow to create an efficient player development system utilizing the entire organization. [...] DeWitt hired him in 2003 to become the vice president of baseball development. [...] As Luhnow lacked a baseball background, his hire was seen as unconventional, but DeWitt saw potential in the Northwestern graduate with an MBA because of his business background and analytical ability.|$|E
