40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{structure}} of the minimum <b>weight</b> <b>base</b> of a matroid M = (E, I) the order of whose element set E is determined by the interleaving of two ordered subsets of E, R and W. The results imply an interesting application in economics, and are useful for the rapid recomputation of the minimum <b>weight</b> <b>base</b> when the order of E is successively modified by changing the interleaving of R and W. As a special case of the main result, the following parametric problem is efficiently solved: For M = (E, I) a matroid with weighted element set E, and R a subset of E, find for all feasible values of q, the minimum <b>weight</b> <b>base</b> of M containing exactly q elements of R. This parametric problem is a weighted matroid intersection problem and hence can be solved by known matroid intersection algorithms. The approach in this paper is different, and vastly improves the efficiency of the solution, as well as determining structural information about the bases...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} normal exophthalmometric {{values for}} a Sri Lankan population and investigate their demographic, physical, refractive and ocular biometric correlates. Methods: The Kandy Eye {{study was a}} population-based, cross-sectional study. By randomized cluster sampling, 1721 eligible participants, who were 40 years old and over were identified; 1375 participated. Exophthalmometry was performed with Hertel's exophthalmometer. Participants' demographics including age, gender and ethnicity were recorded. Height, weight, body mass index, non-cycloplegic refraction and ocular biometry were measured with standardized methods. Summary {{statistical analysis was performed}} for exophthalmometric values and relationships with other factors were tested using Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient analysis, standard single and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 1341 subjects were included in the analysis. Exophthalmometric values for the population had a mean of 15. 82 mm, standard deviation of 2. 73 mm and range of 10. 46 – 21. 28 mm. Exophthalmometric values for men were significantly higher than women. There {{were no significant differences between}} the racial groups' exophthalmometric values (Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors). Exophthalmometric values were significantly correlated with age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, base and axial length but not to refractive spherical equivalents. Only gender, <b>weight,</b> <b>base</b> and axial length were independent predictors for exophthalmometric values after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In this Sri Lankan population, our study provided the first reported estimates of a normal exophthalmometric range and determined gender, <b>weight,</b> <b>base</b> and axial length as its correlates. Sri Lankans are the first population to demonstrate this relationship between weight and exophthalmometric values and also showed that refraction is not a cause for pseudo-proptosis.

We extend this work to provide an efficient 2 -quasi-greedy algorithm where a minimum <b>weight</b> <b>base</b> is constrained to have a fixed number of elements from two disjoint sets. Our main results show that optimal bases for adjacent states may not themselves be adjacent. However, optimal solutions for adjacent states may be identified solely from information available in the current base, yielding a method whose efficiency rivals that of the quasi-greedy method. We also give theorems {{making it possible to}} jump over certain adjacent states, further increasing efficiency...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{function}} of common, positive tone photoresist materials {{is based on}} radiation-induced modulation of the dissolution rate of phenolic polymer films in aqueous base. The process through which novolac and other low molecular weight phenolic polymers undergo dissolution is examined from a new perspective in which the “average degree of ionization ” of the polymer {{is regarded as the}} principal factor that determines the rate of dissolution rather than a diffusive, transport process. This perspective has been coupled with a probabilistic model that provides an explanation for the dependence of the dissolution rate on molecular <b>weight,</b> <b>base</b> concentration, added salts, residual casting solvent, and the addition of “dissolution inhibitors”. It predicts the observed minimum base concentration below which dissolution is no longer observed, and it predicts a molecular weight dependence of that phenomenon. A series of experiments was designed to test this predicted molecular weight response. The results of these experiments are in good agreement with the predicted response...|$|E

The present study aimed at evaluating the {{survival rate}} of preterm and LBW infants, predictive factors, and the risk of mortality in three training hospitals of Mashhad and Tabriz cities. Methods: This prospective, cohort study was conducted during six months from 2013 to 2014. Infants with birth weight ≤ 1500 g or gestational age ≤ 32 weeks were enrolled.
