5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will <b>whistle</b> <b>on</b> the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was look at her and into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a <b>whistle.</b> <b>On</b> one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E
