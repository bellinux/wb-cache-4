25|$|Yellowfin whiting {{primarily}} inhabit shallow protected {{inshore waters}} in depths {{of less than}} 10 m, often moving across tidal flats less than a meter deep. They are commonly found on sand flats, bars and spits, as well as mangrove lined tidal creeks, mud flats, seagrass beds and estuaries. Yellowfin whiting move with the tide, pushing into the shallows of creeks and flats to forage at high tide and moving back to the sandy hollows of deeper slopes of channels and banks as the tide falls. In Western Australia, they often enter large, sandy estuaries such as the Swan and Leschenault Estuary where they many penetrate the limits of brackish water, indicating they can survive in low salinity environments. Conversely, they have been recorded in the extremely saline waters of upper Spencer Gulf and Shark Bay, suggesting a <b>wide</b> <b>tolerance</b> to salinity. Juveniles inhabit the same environments as adults in South Australia, but in Western Australia adults move from the tidal creeks and seagrass beds to more sand dominated environments including high energy beaches.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} the externally modulated optical minimum shift keying (MSK) signal. The tolerance against fiber dispersion, linear crosstalk, self phase modulation (SPM), and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) threshold for MSK is studied and compared with that of 50 % duty cycle return-to-zero differential phase shift keying (RZ-DPSK) and 50 % duty cycle RZ on-off-keying (RZ-OOK), via both experiment and simulation. Simulation results show that the MSK signal has the <b>widest</b> <b>tolerance</b> against SPM and the smallest linear crosstalk among these formats. Experimental results agree with the simulation on negative penalty against SPM <b>tolerance</b> and show <b>widest</b> <b>tolerance</b> against dispersion tolerance for MSK The measured SBS threshold of both MSK and RZ-DPSK is more than 10 dB higher than that of an RZ-OOK system.

The species growth rate responds to increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, making the species a possible indicator of anthropogenic pollution leading to eutrophication.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} killifish or mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus (syn. Rivulus marmoratus), is {{a species}} of fish in the Aplocheilidae family. It lives in brackish and marine waters (less frequently in fresh water) along the coasts of Florida, through the Antilles, and along the eastern and northern coasts of Mexico, Central America and South America (south to Brazil). It has a very <b>wide</b> <b>tolerance</b> of both salinity (0—68 ‰) and temperature (12-38 C), can survive for about two months on land, and mostly breeds by self-fertilization.

40|$|AbstractIdentifying a {{suitable}} compromise between tight and thus expensive <b>tolerances</b> and <b>wide</b> <b>tolerances</b> that may negatively influence the product quality {{is a major}} challenge. This paper focuses on the tolerance-cost-optimization of mechanical assemblies with interrelated dimension chains considering dependencies between the tolerance–cost-relationships. Taking into account interrelated dimension chains the crux is, however, that modifications of a single tolerance can influence several dimension chains {{as well as the}} resulting production costs. Based on different existing approaches for the statistical tolerance-cost-optimization, the authors will provide appropriate guidance for the product developer dealing with interrelated dimension chains...|$|R

50|$|Emiliania huxleyi is {{considered}} a ubiquitous species. It exhibits {{one of the largest}} temperature ranges (1-30oC) of any coccolithophores species. It has been observed under a range of nutrient levels from oligotrophic (subtropical gyres) to eutrophic waters (upwelling zones/ Norwegian fjords). Its presence in plankton communities from the surface to 200m depth indicates a high tolerance for both fluctuating and low light conditions. This extremely <b>wide</b> <b>tolerance</b> of environmental conditions is believed to be explained by the existence of a range of environmentally adapted ecotypes within the species. As a result of these tolerances its distribution ranges from the sub-Arctic to the sub-Antarctic and from coastal to oceanic habitats. Within this range it is present in nearly all euphotic zone water samples and accounts for 20-50% or more of the total coccolithophore community.|$|E

50|$|While {{they were}} {{powerful}} machines, the 5600s were very unpopular with footplate crews at the time. They were beset by numerous failures, {{the most common}} of which was hot axle boxes. They lacked the <b>wider</b> <b>tolerances</b> in their boxes that the original Welsh company locomotives had. They also had the tendency to derail, so those driving them preferred them in reverse, where the pony truck was able to guide them around tight curves. When the Welsh railwaymen discovered that the new GWR 5700 Class 0-6-0 pannier tank (introduced 1929) was even more suitable for the same work - being shorter and lighter, with roughly the same (slightly lower) tractive effort - no further Class 56xx/66xx locos were built.|$|R
