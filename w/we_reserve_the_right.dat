2500|$|In {{response}} to these attacks, the IRA began a reactive assassination campaign against leading members of the UDA and UVF.

The main reason for this was {{the negative impact of}} attacks on civilians on the republican movement's electoral appeal. The IRA issued a statement in 1986 saying: [...] "At no time will we involve ourselves in the execution of ordinary Protestants, but at all times <b>we</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to take armed action against those who attempt to terrorise or intimidate our people into accepting British/unionist rule".
