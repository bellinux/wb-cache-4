40|$|We {{investigated}} whether supervisors' listening {{attitudes and}} skills {{were related to}} working conditions and psychological stress reactions among their subordinates. The subjects included 41 male supervisors and their immediate subordinates (n= 203). The supervisors completed a short version of the Active Listening Attitude Scale (ALAS) consisting of two subscales: Listening Attitude and Listening Skill for Active Listening. The subordinates rated working conditions and their psychological stress reactions using selected scales of the Job Content Questionnaire and the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a higher score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill reported a more favorable psychological stress reaction than those who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a lower score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a higher score of Listening Skill reported higher worksite support than those who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a lower score of Listening Skill. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a higher score of Listening Attitude reported higher job control than those who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with a lower score of Listening Attitude. A supervisor's listening attitude and skill appeared to affect psychological stress reactions predominantly among male subordinates than among female subordinates. Psychological stress reactions were lower among younger subordinates who <b>worked</b> <b>under</b> supervisors with high listening skill, while no statistically difference was observed among older subordinates. These findings suggest that a supervisor's listening attitude and skill {{have an effect on}} working conditions and psychological stress reactions among subordinates and that the effects vary according to the subordinates' sex and age...|$|R

5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not <b>work</b> <b>under</b> rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not <b>work</b> <b>under</b> a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
