So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to,</b> kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well.

Hall said that [...] "We [...] attach identities to people, saying, 'It’s too late to reach this person,' or 'This person here, there’s still some good there, so we should try on this one,' or 'This one’s a lost cause, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get him out of here'.

In September 2016, {{discussing}} the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, [...] "You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, {{we will continue to}} move forward." [...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas {{in the back of your}} mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly."

Davis was reunited with Pat Riley, and Riley admitted he made a mistake of trading Davis in the first place; [...] "I made the mistake of trading him. He's a very talented kid.

It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Carruthers scored for {{the first}} time in 2005–06 with the winning goal in a 1–0 victory away to Grimsby Town on 10 December 2005 after scoring from a free kick on 80 minutes. He played {{regularly}} after signing permanently, appearing in 45 matches and scoring once in his first full season at the club. Ahead of 2006–07, Carruthers said [...] "We've got a good set of players and have proved that – especially away against some of the top sides. We're capable of getting results; <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get that consistency". He played in an FA Cup fourth round match against Championship team Derby County on 27 January 2007, in which he cleared an Arturo Lupoli header off the line, although Rovers lost 1–0. He played in both legs of Rovers' play-off semi-final victory over Lincoln City, which finished 7–4 on aggregate. He played in the 2007 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007, which Rovers won 3–1 against Shrewsbury Town, thus earning promotion to League One. He finished the season with 54 appearances and agreed a new one-year contract with the club in July 2007.|$|E
500|$|White was {{recalled}} to the Australian ODI and Twenty20 squads for the 2008 {{tour of the}} West Indies. He scored 10runs off 6balls in a rain-reduced 11-over Twenty20 contest, and in a 50-over tour {{match against}} University of West Indies Vice-Chancellor's XI, made 34 but remained wicket-less in his eight overs with the ball. By this stage in his career, White was generally considered a middle-order batsman who bowled a bit, but Australia captain Ponting saw {{his place in the}} team as that of the front-line spinner. [...] "White's obviously been picked as the spinner on this tour. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure. Hopefully he plays a big role for us during the series." [...] Despite Ponting's comments, he used White as the fourth-change bowler in the first ODI, bringing the slow left-arm spin of Michael Clarke on first. White conceded 32runs in his six overs without a breakthrough, and did not bowl at all in the second match, as Clarke claimed the man of the match award for his half-century and three wickets. [...] Although White scored 40* at quicker than a run a ball, the return of Andrew Symonds for the last three ODIs left White out of the team again.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the course}} of the bands lifetime, we've slowly been pushing into this direction. We all love slow and pummeling music, but <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> change things up and expand our sound. Each record has been a bit faster than the one before. That said, when we played with Slayer at ATP last year that kind of {{refreshed}} my personal interest in faster music. We watched most of the soundcheck (until we were booted out of the room) and we were all energized. For a long time I felt that slower music had more punishing power but I'm not sure that is always the case. This record is definitely much darker and heavier than anything we've done.|$|R

The editing thing was an arbitrary choice at first. This film was about two best buds and their respective relationships, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> give them some career to do together so they could bitch at work to one another.

2500|$|Rather than {{work with}} Date, their {{producer}} for many years, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin on their fifth studio album. Cunningham {{said that while}} the group enjoyed working with Date, [...] "at this point, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> change things up [...] And this is definitely a different style. Working with him [...] is just putting us fucking upside down. He's cracking the whip". After recording all the instrumental parts for the record, Moreno decided to record his vocals separately, and finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. According to an interview with Abe Cunningham, there were tensions involved with the recording of Saturday Night Wrist that were related to the band members' personal lives. Cunningham compared the process to pulling teeth.|$|R

30|$|In {{line with}} our {{findings}} in Proposition 2, the participants’ {{low levels of}} uncertainty avoidance {{did not affect the}} affordable loss attribute, i.e. {{there was no evidence of}} concerns with expected returns. One interviewee stated that “we were trying to be very clear about producing good projects, we did not care about the returns, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> present a valuable service. We knew the profits would come later” while another said “I reached a point in my life where I was not afraid of failing. If you are afraid to fail, you will never proceed”. This and similar statements suggest that entrepreneurs in Kuwait are not concerned with expected return, although we did not find enough evidence to state that an attitude of affordable loss was adopted. Nevertheless, it may be concluded that the high uncertainty avoidance of the society does not hinder the affordable loss attribute.|$|R

He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock.

Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain.

Chancellor Angela Merkel could fast-track zero-emission zones for Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt by 2025, for example — restoring Germany's environmental lead. The Volkswagen debacle should be treated as an Enron moment for sustainability measurement and valuation, with a comparable overhaul of the requirements for corporate accounting and evaluation.
