25|$|This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism {{is seen in}} {{the thought}} and {{teaching}} of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson's focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans yearn for God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob BÃ¶hme, William Law and The Imitation of Christ. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical experiences that are found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the nous ("mind") as the site of God's interaction with our souls; through the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit,</b> our mind is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God in our midst.|$|E

In the same pamphlet, he defends an appeal to the emotions, and advocates preaching terror when necessary, even to children, who in God's sight [...] "are young vipers... if not Christ's." ...|$|E

If they are still, as St. Paul would say, in the flesh, let them have, if they wish, a civil permit to live together, for the Spirit can {{have nothing to do with}} such an union. True to herself, the Church symbolizes the union of her members, the reborn. She has nothing to do with laws and conventions which are supposedly for the good of society, nor is any union accomplished if those whom she supposedly joins are not reborn. If they are, the Church can neither make it or dissolve it, but merely confirm and acknowledge the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit.</b> And every <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> is a sacrament.

Nor dare I {{give this}} {{description}} otherwise than thus, {{because there is}} a real distinction to be put between that righteousness by which we should be just before God, and that which is in us a principle of sanctification; the first being the obedience of the Son of God without us, the second being the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> in our hearts. There is also a difference to be put betwixt the principle by which we work righteousness, and the works themselves; as a difference is to be put betwixt the cause and the effect, the tree and the apple.|$|E

But I shewed you, that when the Spirit of Christ comes and works effectually, it doth not only shew men their sins against the law, but also shews them their lost condition, if they believe not in the righteousness, blood, death, resurrection, and intercession of Jesus Christ, the Son of Mary, the Son of God (John 6:44, 16:24; Matt 3:17; Heb 1:9).

The {{ground is}} removed; for a {{grounded}} fear of damnation is this--I am yet in my sins, {{in a state}} of nature, under the law, without faith, and so under the wrath of God. This, I say, is the ground of the fear of damnation, the true ground to fear it; but now the man that we are talking of, is one that hath the ground of this fear taken away by the testimony and seal of the spirit of adoption. He is called, justified, and has, for the truth of this his condition, received the evidence of the spirit of adoption, and hath been thereby enabled to call God [...] "Father, Father." [...] Now he that hath received this, has the ground of the fear of damnation taken from him; therefore his fear, I say, being without ground, is false, and so no <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of God.|$|E
6000|$|The {{theology}} of the Confession of Faith is, of course, Calvinistic.

[...] "Idolaters," [...] and wicked people, not having that spirit, can do no good works. The blasphemy that [...] "men who live according to equity and justice shall be saved, what religion soever they have professed," [...] is to be abhorred. [...] "The Kirk is invisible," [...] consisting of the Elect, [...] "who are known only to God." [...] This gave much cause of controversy to Knox's Catholic opponents. [...] "The notes of the true Church" [...] are those of Calvin's. As to the Sacrament, though the elements be not the natural body of Christ, yet [...] "the faithful, in the right use of the Lord's Table, so do eat the body and drink {{the blood of the}} Lord Jesus that He remains in them and they in Him [...] . in such conjunction with Christ Jesus as the natural man cannot comprehend." ...|$|E

In the national churches, what do we hear but Moses and the law, 'This do and live'; or, in other words, do your duty {{as well as you}} can, and Christ will do the rest: thus making the gospel the sacrifice of Christ, and the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit,</b> of no effect. Whereas, on the contrary, unregenerate, depraved, and sinful mortals 'have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God preventing [or going before] them, that they may have a good will; and working in and by them, when they have that good will'; which is perfectly agreeable to our Lord's declaration, (John 15:5) 'Without me, ye can do nothing.'--Mason and Ryland.|$|E

60|$|Now {{when this}} living water is received, it takes up its {{seat in the}} heart, whence it spreads itself to the {{awakening}} of all {{the powers of the}} soul. For, as in the first creation, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, in order to putting of that creature into that excellent fashion and harmony which now we behold with our eyes; even so the new creation, to wit, the making of us new to God, is done by the overspreading of the same Spirit also. For the Spirit, as I may so say, sitteth and broodeth upon the powers of the soul, as the hen doth on cold eggs, till they wax warm and receive life. The Spirit, then, warmeth us, and bringeth the dead and benumbed soul--for so it is before conversion--to a godly sense and understanding of states, of states both natural and spiritual; and {{this is the beginning of}} the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit,</b> by which the soul is made capable of understanding what God and himself is.|$|E
60|$|And now, that thy {{answer is}} false, I shall clearly prove. Fist, because thou deniest that {{redemption}} was wrought out for sinners by the Man Christ Jesus on the cross, or tree, on Mount Calvary; when the scripture saith plainly, {{that when he}} did hang on the tree, then did he bear all our sins there in his own body (1Peter 2:24). And secondly, being within; when the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of Christ in believers, is to make known to the soul by dwelling within, which way {{and how they were}} redeemed by the Man Christ Jesus on the cross. And this I prove farther, because when thou art forced to answer to these words, why did the Man Christ Jesus hang on the cross on Mount Calvary for the sins of his children? Thou sayest, because they wickedly judged him to be a blasphemer. Friend, I did not ask thee why the Jews did put him to death? But why was he crucified there for the sins of his children? But thou willing to cover over thine error, goest on cunningly saying, and though their envy they persecuted him to death, for an evil doer. This is one ground at least, &c.|$|E

Now {{also that}} fiery law, {{that it could}} not once endure, nor could not once delight in, I say, now it can delight in it after the inward man; now this law is its delight, it would always be walking in it, and always be delighting in it, being {{offended}} with any sin or any corruption that would be anyways an hinderance to it (Rom 7:24,25). And yet it will not abide, it will not endure that that, even that that law should offer to take the work of its salvation out of Christ's hand; no, if it once comes to do that, then out of doors it shall go, if it were as good again. For that soul that hath the right work of God indeed upon it, cries, Not my prayers, not my tears, not my works, not my things, do they come from the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of Christ itself within me, yet these shall not have the glory of my salvation; no, it is none but the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, of the Man Christ Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter's son, as they called Him, that must have the crown and glory of my salvation. None but Christ, none but Christ. And thus the soul labours to give Christ the preeminence (Col 1:18).|$|E
6000|$|... 1. It {{is called}} a grace, that is, a sweet and blessed <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of grace, as he {{is given to the}} elect by God. Hence the apostle says, [...] "let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear" [...] (Heb 12:28). For as that fear that brings bondage is wrought in the soul by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage, so this fear, which is a fear that we have while we are in the liberty of sons, is wrought by him as he manifesteth to us our liberty; [...] "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty," [...] that is, where he is as a spirit of adoption, setting the soul free from that bondage under which it was held by the same Spirit while he wrought as a spirit of bondage. Hence as he {{is called a}} spirit working bondage to fear, so he, as the Spirit of the Son and of adoption, is called [...] "the Spirit of the fear of the Lord" [...] (Isa 11:2). Because it is that Spirit of grace that is the author, animater, and {{maintainer}} of our filial fear, or of that fear that is son-like, and that subjecteth the elect unto God, his word, and ways; unto him, his word, and ways, as a Father.|$|E

But neither do parts or learning make men the better Christians, though the better orators and disputants; {{and it is the}} ignorance of people about the divine gift, that causes that vulgar and mischievous mistake. Theory and practice, speculation and enjoyment, words and life, are two things. O! it is the penitent, the reformed, the lowly, the watchful, the self-denying, and holy soul, that is the Christian! And that frame is the fruit and <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit,</b> which is the life of Jesus; whose life, though hid in the fulness of it in God the Father, is shed abroad in the hearts of them that truly believe, according to their capacity.
