25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar <b>water</b> <b>wall.</b> These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{measures}} vessels {{can take}} to protect themselves against piracy are air-pressurised boat stopping systems which can fire a variety of vessel-disabling projectiles, [...] implementing a high freewall and vessel boarding protection systems (e.g., hot <b>water</b> <b>wall,</b> electricity-charged <b>water</b> <b>wall,</b> automated fire monitor, slippery foam). Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements. Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention. Previously this data could only be picked up {{if there was a}} nearby ship, thus rendering single ships vulnerable. However, special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship or steal large portions of cargo with another ship since an escort can be sent more quickly than might otherwise have been the case.|$|E
2500|$|Practically {{this means}} that water {{accelerated}} by large drops can create stronger standing waves (undular bores) {{in the form of}} hydraulic jumps as it decelerates {{at the base of the}} drop. Such standing waves, when found downstream of a weir or natural rock ledge, can form an extremely dangerous [...] "keeper" [...] with a <b>water</b> <b>wall</b> that [...] "keeps" [...] floating objects (e.g., logs, kayaks, or kayakers) recirculating in the standing wave for extended periods.|$|E

25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the <b>water</b> <b>walls.</b> From these headers the water rises through the <b>water</b> <b>walls</b> of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the <b>water</b> <b>walls)</b> or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|R

2500|$|Pressurized airflow bed {{gasification}} technology {{created through}} the joint development between Wison Group and Shell (Hybrid).

Results presented demonstrate that non-tempered weld joints of low-alloy creep-resistant steels T 23 and T 24 undergo a process of secondary hardening during long-term exposure at elevated temperatures.

Therefore, PWHT of T 23 and T 24 welds is necessary to achieve suitable hardness and plastic properties of welds...|$|R
40|$|High flame {{temperature}} oxy-combustion and low {{flame temperature}} oxy-combustion {{are the two}} primary types of oxy-combustion, which is the combustion of fossil fuel with oxygen instead of air. High flame temperature oxy-combustion results in increased radiant energy, but heat flux at the <b>water</b> <b>walls</b> has been demonstrated to be maintained within design parameters. Less fossil fuel is used, so less CO{sub 2 } is produced. Latent and sensible heat can be partially recovered from the compressors. CO{sub 2 } capture costs are decreased. Evenly distributed heat avoids creating hot spots. The NETL IPR capture system can capture 100 % of the CO{sub 2 } when operating at steady state. New boiler designs for high flame temperature oxy-combustion {{can take advantage of}} the higher flame temperatures. High flame temperature oxy-combustion with IPR capture can be retrofitted on existing plants. High flame temperature oxy-combustion has significantly improved radiant heat transfer compared to low flame temperature oxy-combustion, but heat flux at the <b>water</b> <b>walls</b> can be controlled. High flame temperature oxy-combustion used with the NETL's Integrated Pollutant Removal System can capture 95 %- 100 % of the CO{sub 2 } with heat recovery. These technologies create CO{sub 2 } capture cost savings, and are applicable to new design and existing design boilers...|$|R
