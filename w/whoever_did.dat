5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the threat that he finally raised the siege.|$|E

Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> it avoided being recorded by security cameras.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} she was cast as Lana, Kreuk had no idea who the {{character}} was in Superman lore. Her uncle, who owned a comic book shop, filled her in on the details and she learned more from the producers. Kreuk realized that the character in the comics and her character on the show were two different people. As a result, Kreuk learns about the development of Lana as Lana is learning in the show, just as Welling does with Clark Kent. When asked if her being cast as a traditionally red haired character caused outcry from fans, Kreuk believes that <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> [...] "got over it pretty fast". By season three, Kreuk had decided to [...] "invest" [...] herself less in her character, as she felt that her character's ultimate development was entirely {{in the hands of the}} producers. She no longer became frustrated when the producers had Lana doing things that Kreuk felt were out of character, instead trusting that they would find the right direction for the character.|$|E

500|$|Silent Alarm {{does not}} contain a solitary lyrical centre and simply observes people's lives. Okereke wanted to leave {{individual}} listeners space {{to make their own}} conclusions, but has admitted that the record [...] "operates in the realm of cultural politics". Much of the songwriting is inspired by the style of confessional poetry authors like Anne Sexton and musicians Thom Yorke and Björk. In general, Silent Alarm tries to make clear an existential pointlessness in life. With hindsight, Okereke noted themes of [...] "helplessness and weariness" [...] because of the album's focus on how he was feeling between the agesof18and20. Professor John Sutherland has pointed out literary elements, often similar to Sylvia Plath's work, in the lyricist's writing. Discussing the opening track [...] "Like Eating Glass", he explained, [...] "It strikes me that <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> the lyrics must have read some of her work. It has the same rather jagged, surprising imagery. It could sit fairly comfortably in a poetry anthology." [...] The recurring line [...] "We've got crosses on our eyes" [...] is inspired by cartoon characters who have crosses on their eyes when they die. Okereke tried to convey the feelings in a failing relationship, [...] "of being completely disorientated", using childhood metaphors.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2013 {{high-speed}} fatal {{car crash}} of journalist Michael Hastings, a vocal {{critic of the}} surveillance state and restrictions on the press freedom under the Obama Administration tenure, Clarke {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers—including the United States—know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on the car—and I'm not saying there was, I think <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> it would probably get away with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{called the}} bomb attempt a [...] "sobering {{reminder}} of the times in which we live", and said that Americans [...] "will not cower in fear" [...] {{as a result of}} it. He telephoned Duane Jackson, one of the vendors, to thank him for alerting police. Attorney General Eric Holder called it a [...] "terrorist act". White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, similarly, said [...] "Anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, I would say that was intended to terrorize, absolutely. And I would say that <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Putin, Politkovskaya's {{influence}} on Russian political life was [...] "very minor". Politkovskaya was {{a critic of}} the authorities, Putin noted, and her influence should not be overestimated. [...] "It was minimal," [...] he concluded. [...] "She was known among journalists and in human rights circles and in the West, but I repeat that she had no {{influence on}} political life. Her murder causes much more harm than her publications did. <b>Whoever</b> <b>did</b> it will be punished." [...] Two hours later, at the session of the St. Petersburg Dialog, the subject arose again. [...] "Those people who are hiding from Russian justice are willing to sacrifice anyone to create a wave of anti-Russian feeling," [...] Putin said.|$|E
2500|$|Citizens of the Culture {{live there}} only very {{occasionally}} as guests, usually {{to study the}} complex ecosystem of the airspheres and the dominant life-forms: the [...] "dirigible behemothaurs" [...] and [...] "gigalithine lenticular entities", which may be described as inscrutable, ancient intelligences looking similar to a cross between gigantic blimps and whales. The airspheres slowly migrate around the galaxy, taking anywhere from 50 to 100 million years to complete one circuit. In the novels {{no one knows who}} created the airspheres or why, but it is presumed that <b>whoever</b> <b>did</b> has long since sublimed but may maintain some obscure link with the behemothaurs and lenticular entities. Guests in the airspheres are not allowed to use any force-field technology, though no reason has been offered for this prohibition.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{military}} {{governments of the}} seventies, {{the tension between the}} government and the university kept growing, until it reached its peak in 1978 during the massive demonstration that occurred to protest rising urban public transportation costs. The Association of University Students (AEU) had a leading role in the protests, but this brought persecution of their leaders and the murder of the secretary general of the association Oliverio Castañeda de León, on 20 October of that year. [...] Just fifteen days after the murder of Castañeda de León, was missing his successor, Antonio Ciani García, and over the next 18 months almost every student leader and university faculty with political connections were threatened (even with the legal parties). <b>Whoever</b> <b>did</b> not paid attention and continued with their protest activities, was simply killed or kidnapped.|$|E
