He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E

Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.'

But he ended up liking it. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the phone, and he said, ‘With a flow like that, you could definitely have a career as a rapper.’ It was the biggest compliment I’ve ever had. It was coming from a god!" [...] She further elaborated that André 3000 is [...] "one of my favorite musicians, lyricists, rappers, of all time." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{considered}} {{the writing of}} Blood to be harder compared to previous OSI albums. Previously, Matheos would send Moore guitar parts to work with, allowing Moore to [...] "work with editing them, pitching them, and fucking about them different ways, and then programming drums and keyboards." [...] When working on Blood, Matheos also provided programming, keyboard and drum parts. [...] "If he sent me stuff that already had drums and keyboard parts, and it wasn't a complete idea, I {{had to figure out}} a way to elaborate on it without having that same equipment that he has there," [...] Moore said. Overall, he {{considered the}} writing process to be [...] "smoother because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> a roll and we're more fluid together".|$|E
500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon suggests that the uncomfortable working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I think all this paid off in terms of what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area. Co-writer Nick Maley reprised his role as a special effects technician to produce the infant twin props that appear in the climax of the film.|$|E

[...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals.

500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 Entertainment Weekly interview, Ward, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a medical show before, stated {{that when she was}} young, her mother was sick for over nine years and she {{spent a lot of time}} in hospitals. This being the reason that, on the set of House, she felt [...] "at home, in a strange way". While she was initially hired to appear only in [...] "Three Stories" [...] and [...] "Honeymoon", the chemistry between Ward and House lead actor Hugh Laurie was strong enough for Ward to return for a multiple-episode story arc in the second season of the show. On working with Ward, Laurie commented [...] "We're professionals who were lucky enough to be extremely well-equipped with a very sound, true script, the fact that Sela is immensely attractive and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well certainly is not an impediment." [...] Though Ward has expressed that she would like to return to the show, Shore told USA Today in 2006 that, although he was eager to write her back in, there were [...] "no specific plans" [...] to have the character return.|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E

500|$|On October 8 1976, Bryant and Scott {{delivered}} a twenty-page treatment entitled , which executives Barry Diller and Michael Eisner liked. In the treatment, Kirk {{and his crew}} encounter beings {{they believe to be}} the mythical Titans and travel back millions of years in time, accidentally teaching early man to make fire. Planet of the Titans also explored the concept of the third eye. With the studio's acceptance of this treatment Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and Isenberg were swamped with grateful fan mail. Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators. Key amongst these were famed production designer Ken Adam, who said that [...] "I was approached by Gene Roddenberry and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> like a house on fire", and thus he was employed to design the film. In turn Adam employed artist Ralph McQuarrie fresh off the yet to be released Star Wars. They worked on designs for planets, planetary and asteroid bases, a black hole [...] "shroud", a crystalline [...] "super brain", and new concepts for the Enterprise, including interior concepts which Adam later revisited for the film Moonraker and a flat-hulled starship design (frequently credited to McQuarrie, but which McQuarrie's own art of book identifies as an Adam design). McQuarrie wrote that [...] "there was no script" [...] thus much of the work was [...] "winging it". When that film folded after three months for Adam and [...] "a month and a half" [...] for McQuarrie, their concepts were shelved, although a handful of them were revisited in later productions.|$|E

It {{was filmed}} in North London over three weeks. Series producer Diana Kyle described the episode as Elliot [...] "go {{on a major}} emotional journey and tak time to reassess his life". Bradley explained: [...] "Elliot goes into this complete breakdown and decides to kill himself", and discussed Elliot's motivation in considering suicide: [...] "Something in his brain snaps. He's overworked and emotionally overwrought." [...] He explained that, while the episode is based on It's a Wonderful Life: [...] "the screen doesn't go wobbly so you know you're in fantasy world. It's played very straight. There are some really interesting things going on - angels in the corridors and nobody knows who this old man is.

All this time the schooner was hanging by the anchor, with her stern just clear of the rocks, and the surf was beginning to break in heavily. Just after the kedge line parted, the pawls of the windlass gave way, and then, nothing holding her she headed right round for the rocks, upon which she was dashed very shortly afterwards We had just enough time to snatch up some of our clothes, get into the boat, which was alongside and pull away.
