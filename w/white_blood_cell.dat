5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|Two of the {{patients}} at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other {{was admitted to the}} medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing leukopenia (low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.|$|E
50|$|It is {{theorized that}} transfusions that contain <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may cause adverse effects through {{multiple}} mechanisms. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may themselves harbor infectious disease and some pathogens {{will be more}} concentrated in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{than the rest of}} the blood product. It is also theorized that the donor <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> may suppress the recipient's immune system by interacting with it.|$|R
5000|$|The sample {{may also}} be tested for <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> A high level of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in semen is called [...] and may {{indicate}} an infection. Cutoffs may vary, but an example cutoff is over 1 million <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> per milliliter of semen.|$|R
50|$|Microvilli {{are also}} of {{importance}} on the <b>cell</b> surface of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> as they {{aid in the}} migration of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In {{most cases the}} LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell.</b> This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Fingolimod {{may give}} rise to {{hypertension}} and slowed heart rate, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or a reduction in lymphocyte levels. Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. While dimethyl fumarate {{may lead to a}} reduction in the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during trials.|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} role of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in tissue ischaemia {{has attracted}} recent interest. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> can block narrow vessels, particularly if perfusion pressure is reduced {{or if the}} cells become activated. To investigate the role of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> in ischaemia microfiltration techniques were {{used to measure the}} flow properties of these cells in patients with severe leg ischaemia before and after amputation. Compared with controls <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> from patients showed impaired ability to flow through 8 μm and 5 μm pore filters. This applied to fractionated granulocytes and mononuclear cells as well as to unfractionated mixed <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> from <b>blood</b> draining the ischaemic leg had worse filterability than those from arm blood of the same patients. After amputation of the ischaemic leg there was definite improvement, the flow properties of the cells being no longer significantly different from controls...|$|R
2500|$|Another way to {{categorize}} disorders of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> is [...] There are various disorders {{in which the}} number of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> is normal but the cells do not function normally.|$|R
50|$|Early {{platelet}} transfusions used {{a filter}} to remove <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{at the time}} of transfusion. It takes a trained person about 10 minutes to assemble the equipment, and this is not the safest or most efficient means of filtration because living <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> can release cytokines during storage and dead <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> can break up into smaller fragments that can still stimulate a dangerous response from the immune system. In addition, simple filtration can lead to increased risks of infection and loss of valuable platelets. Newer, more advanced thrombapheresis machines can filter <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> during separation.|$|R
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML {{can be made by}} examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5000|$|Leukemia {{is usually}} {{described}} either as [...] "acute", which grows quickly, or [...] "chronic", which grows slowly. One main type of acute leukemia is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), {{which accounts for}} about 3 out of 4 cases of leukemia in children. ALL {{is a form of}} leukemia that affects the lymphocytes, a type of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> which fights infection. When a patient has ALL, the bone marrow makes too many immature <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and they do not mature correctly. Therefore, the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> over-produce, crowding the other <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> also do not work correctly to fight infection.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} higher {{relative}} density, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are collected as an unwanted component with the platelets. Since it takes up to 3 liters of whole blood (the amount {{of a dozen}} blood bags) to generate a dose of platelets, <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> from one or several donors will also be collected along with the platelets. A 70 kg (154 lb) man has only about 6 liters of blood. If all of the incidentally collected <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are transfused with the platelets, substantial rejection problems can occur. Therefore, it is standard practice to filter out <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> before transfusion {{by the process of}} leukoreduction.|$|R
50|$|A Khodadoust line {{is made up}} of {{mononuclear}} <b>cells</b> (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells).</b> These cells {{appear at}} the vascularized edge of the recently transplanted cornea. If untreated, the line of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> will move across and damage the endothelial cells of the cornea over the space of several days.|$|R
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
50|$|Leukocyte {{esterase}} (LE) is an esterase (a type of enzyme) {{produced by}} leukocytes (<b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells).</b> A leukocyte esterase test (LE test) is a urine {{test for the}} presence of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and other abnormalities associated with infection.|$|R
5000|$|Platelets: are <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{that once}} activated, {{aggregate}} and form clots. There are age-related differences in platelet number and their activity. They form aggregates with <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and in adults the platelets that {{are bound to}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are usually activated. In children, these <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> cell-platelet aggregates are increased in children compared to adult levels, however this takes place without a corresponding increase in platelet activation. Increased <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> -platelet aggregates in adults can indicate atherosclerosis; interestingly, {{this is not the}} case in children.|$|R
50|$|Jawed {{vertebrates}} have {{an adaptive}} immune system, {{based largely on}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> help to resist infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood. Arthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes {{as part of their}} immune system.|$|R
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell.</b> Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
50|$|Her work {{made a major}} {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} biological dosimetry methods in which changes to the chromosomes in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are measured with extreme precision, by making it possible to count the concerned <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> under the microscope.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone named <b>White</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>Cells</b> {{the nineteenth}} best {{album of the}} decade, and [...] "Fell in Love with a Girl" [...] the fifty-eighth best song of the decade. Q listed <b>White</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>Cells</b> {{as one of the}} best 50 albums of 2001.|$|R
40|$|The {{changes of}} red and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> counts in intact and {{castrated}} rats with hyperthyroidism were analysed. A total of 108 five-month-old female Wistar rats, divided into four groups, were used as following: euthyroid castrated, euthyroid intact, hyperthyroid castrated and hyperthyroid intact. Nine animals of each group were killed at 30, 60 and 90 days to evaluate the red and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> counts. The conclusion was that castration or hyperthyroidism did not affect both the red and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> count, {{which may}} then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} margination of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> {{and demonstrate}} the dependency {{on a number}} of conditions including hematocrit, the deformability of the cells and the Reynolds number. A detailed mesoscopic hydrodynamic Helfrich-type model is derived, validated and used for the simulations to provides a quantitative description of the margination of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> Previous simulation results, obtained with less detailed models, could be confirmed, e. g. the largest probability of margination of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> at an intermediate range of hematocrit values and a decreasing tendency with increasing deformability. The consideration of inertia effects, which become of relevance in small vessels, also shows a dependency and leads to less pronounced margination of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> with increasing Reynolds number...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} smoking was {{investigated}} on {{the formation of}} 7 -methylguanines in human peripheral <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> DNA was isolated from total <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> granulocytes and lymphocytes from 10 smokers and 10 non-smokers. 32 P-Postlabeling was performed by using anion-exchange chromatography enrichment of adducts. In smokers the mean DNA adduct levels were 6. 9, 4. 7 and 23. 6 7 -methyl-guanine residues/ 107 nucleotides hi total <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> granulocytes and lymphocytes respectively. The corres-ponding values hi non-smokers were 3. 4, 2. 8 and 13. 5 adducts/ 107 nucleotides. The mean adduct level was significantly higher hi lymphocytes than hi total <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> or granulocytes both hi smokers and in non-smokers. The mean adduct levels differed significantly between smokers and non-smokers...|$|R
