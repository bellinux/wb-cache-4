5000|$|A {{corporate}} {{resolution is}} a corporate action, {{sometimes in the}} form of a legal document, that will be voted on or has been voted on at a meeting of the board of directors for a corporation. The resolution could also be {{in the form of}} a [...] "corporate action" [...] which has the same binding effect as an action taken at a duly called meeting. For a corporate action, if allowed by state law and by the bylaws of the corporation, the board of directors may use a written document to <b>waive</b> formal <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> a meeting and unanimously consent to a resolution.|$|R
50|$|In Virginia, default is filed {{automatically}} if {{the defendant}} fails {{to respond in}} any way within 21 days of service of process being effected. A defendant that defaults thereby <b>waives</b> further <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> proceedings (unless the defendant has an attorney <b>of</b> record), and <b>waives</b> {{the right to a}} jury trial in any further proceedings. However, entry of a default does not by itself resolve the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must then move for a default judgment against the defendant. Where the case is premised on liquidated damages, such as a breach of a promissory note, then judgment will be entered in that amount. If damaged are unliquidated, however, the plaintiff must move for a hearing on damages, which will be decided by the court unless the plaintiff demands a jury on the damages claim. A defendant who has defaulted may still appear at the damages hearing to contest the amount of damages, but can not challenge liability.|$|R

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} five types of grain {{are subject to}} the law of challah: wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Quantities of dough made from these {{different}} grains are counted together. They were also subject to the prohibition of the consumption of new produce before the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf, and to the prohibition of reaping prior to Passover. If they took root prior to the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf, the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf released them for consumption. But if not, they were prohibited until the next <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf. The Mishnah taught that rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, and legumes are exempt from challah (for though they are sometimes made into dough, they are not capable of leavening), as are less than five-fourths of a kav, or about 3½ pounds (the minimum subject to challah) of the five kinds of grain subject to challah. Sponge-biscuits, honey cakes, dumplings, pancakes, and dough made from a mixture of consecrated and unconsecrated grain are also exempt from challah.|$|R

The term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> is defined as the period an employer has to notify workers in advance of their up-coming dismissal. The wages paid during this period are an important element of firing costs and hence employment protection. To find a causal effect, I exploit the exogenous change in the term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> that resulted from the introduction of a new Dutch law in 1999. Strong evidence is found that a longer ‘dormant’ term <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> leads to higher wages.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements.
