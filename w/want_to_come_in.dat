500|$|Producer Ted Childs {{had begun}} {{his career with}} Euston on Special Branch (1969–74) and had {{produced}} episodes of The Sweeney and its film spin-offs Sweeney! (1977) and Sweeney 2 (1978). Childs saw Quatermass as a big gamble for Euston, {{out of step with}} the company's usual fare. Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and just do the same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company". He continues to be one of British television's top producers, responsible for such shows as Chancer (1991), Inspector Morse (1987–2000), Sharpe (1993–2006), Kavanagh QC (1995–2001) and Lewis (2006–present).|$|E
500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E
500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that {{they might want to}} chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the way, I had my fist balled up behind my back ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E

2500|$|Dyer, {{who is from}} East London where EastEnders is set, had {{previously}} been offered {{a role in the}} soap in 2009, but turned it down, fearing the level of publicity it would bring. He also said he turned down a 10-episode role in EastEnders because it was an [...] "obvious gangster bully" [...] who would be [...] "blown up by Phil Mitchell". Dyer also revealed that he was approached to play Carl White, but turned it down. He said, [...] "if I'd gone down that route, then I wouldn't be playing the role I am now." [...] Dyer confirmed on 19 October 2013 that he had already started filming his role, stating, [...] "I've already got my kit off for the cameras—we had a funny sex scene early on. But I don't get my bollocks out, you'll be glad to hear." [...] Richie, experienced at playing a landlord in the show, mentored Dyer and helped him on the pub set because he [...] "couldn't even open the f***ing till". He was also trained in how to use a beer engine. After Dyer had been filming for a month, he stated that he was [...] "bringing something to soap land that's never been seen before" [...] and said that taking over The Queen Victoria was [...] "a big responsibility" [...] that he was ready for, adding [...] "I don't want to let them down". He said that his character's entrance to the show was [...] "flawless, but it's not going to be what you expect", and felt that he would have the same impact as original landlord Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). He also thought that his role would be controversial, because of the baggage that comes with him as an actor. Inside Soap said that the success of Mick, the Carter family and the pub all rest on Dyer's shoulders, of which Dyer said put pressure on him but he added that [...] "there should be pressure coming into a show like this. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> as some peripheral character". He hoped that people would find Mick believable and loveable.|$|E
