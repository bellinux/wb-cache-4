50|$|It is {{speculated that}} once formed, Cdc20:Mad2 {{complexes}} can amplify the anaphase <b>wait</b> <b>signal</b> by stimulating further conversion of cytosolic Open Mad2 and free Cdc20 into more Cdc20:Closed Mad2 complexes. This diffusible signal propagation {{away from the}} kinetochore complexes could account for how vacancy of just one tiny kinetochore site can completely shut down the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.|$|E
50|$|Choosing the buffer-size, for file {{reading and}} writing, or file sending and receiving, is {{done at the}} {{application}} level. The buffer is maintained using a circular linked list. It consists {{of a set of}} BufferNodes. Each BufferNode has a DataField. The DataField contains the data and a pointer called NextBufferNode that points to the next BufferNode. To find the current position, two pointers are used: CurrentBufferNode and EndBufferNode, that represent the position in the BufferNode for the last write and read positions.If the BufferNode has no free space, it will send a <b>wait</b> <b>signal</b> to the client to wait until there is available space.|$|E
40|$|Background: The mitotic {{checkpoint}} {{prevents the}} onset of anaphase before all chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules. The checkpoint is thought to act by the catalytic generation at unattached kinetochores of a diffusible "wait signal" that prevents anaphase. Mad 2 and Cdc 20, two candidate proteins for components of a diffusible <b>wait</b> <b>signal,</b> have previously {{been shown to be}} recruited to and rapidly released from unattached kinetochores. Results: Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching demonstrated that Mad 1, Bub 1, and a portion of Mad 2, all essential mitotic-checkpoint components, are stably bound elements of unattached kinetochores (as are structural centromere components such as Centromere protein C [CENP-C]). After microtubule attachment, Mad 1 and Mad 2 are released from kinetochores and relocalize to spindle poles, whereas Bub 1 remains at kinetochores. Conclusions: A long residence time at kinetochores identifies Bub 1, Mad 1, and a portion of Mad 2 as part of a catalytic platform that recruits, activates, and releases a diffusible <b>wait</b> <b>signal</b> that is partly composed of the rapidly exchanging portion of Mad 2. The release of Mad 1 and Mad 2, but not Bub 1, from kinetochores upon attachment separates the elements of this "catalytic platform" and thereby silences generation of the anaphase inhibitor despite continued rapid cycling of Mad 2 at spindle poles...|$|E
30|$|In the {{secondary}} system, SUs can monitor the real-time {{situation of the}} shared channels by periodic spectrum sensing. Once there is no spectrum hole, {{the secondary}} system will inform a <b>waiting</b> <b>signaling</b> to the primary system through the spectrum broker. After receiving this signaling, the PU who is ready to transmit will wait {{for a period of}} time and inform the secondary system the target channel that it reclaims. The SU in the specific channel will vacate the channel immediately after it finishes the ongoing transmission. If the channel can be released before the PU's waiting time is due, then the PU can access the target channel and the PU's service is only deferred. Otherwise, the PU will be blocked. Once the SUs sense that there appears a spectrum hole (a SU or PU in service left), the <b>waiting</b> <b>signaling</b> is canceled for PUs in the primary system via the spectrum broker. In the situation without <b>waiting</b> <b>signaling,</b> the proposed mechanism works in the same way as the preemptive mechanism.|$|R

40|$|SDRAM is {{commonly}} used in cost-sensitive applications requiring large amounts of memory. Though SDRAM is inexpensive, the implementation of refresh operations, open row management, and various delays and command sequences requires logic. The Nios SDRAM Controller with an Avalon interface, transparently handles SDRAM initialization, refresh, and all other SDRAM requirements and appears to software as a simple linear memory interface (flat address space) with a <b>wait</b> <b>signal.</b> The SDRAM Controller supports standard SDRAM as described in PC 100. With the SDRAM Controller, users can access SDRAM subsystems with data widths of 8, 16, 32, or 64 -bits, various memory sizes, and multiple chip selects. Users may also choose to share the tristate data and address buses with other tristate devices. This feature is valuable in systems which have multiple types of external memory devices, but limited I/O pins. The Avalon tristate interface is required to share pins. ...|$|E

40|$|The spindle {{checkpoint}} is a {{cell cycle}} surveillance system that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation. In mitosis, it elicits the “wait anaphase” signal to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome until all chromosomes achieve bipolar microtubule attachment and align at the metaphase plate. Because a single kinetochore unattached to microtubules activates the checkpoint, the <b>wait</b> anaphase <b>signal</b> {{is thought to}} be generated by this kinetochore and is then amplified and distributed throughout the cell to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Several spindle checkpoint kinases participate in the generation and amplification of this signal. Recent studies have begun to reveal the activation mechanisms of these checkpoint kinases. Increasing evidence also indicates that the checkpoint kinases not only help to generate the <b>wait</b> anaphase <b>signal</b> but also actively correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects...|$|R

This work discusses the design and implementation of basic synchronization primitives for DSMs. It contributes a detailed study {{on the impact of}} per-node multi-threading on synchronization. Furthermore, the need for decentralized approaches for scalability is emphasized. Barriers are realized through a dynamically generated tree for a multicast on a barrier release. Communication parameters of dierent nodes can be taken into account when building this tree. Mutual exclusion is supported by serving requests in FIFO order of their arrival over a token-passing protocol. Conditional synchronization also adheres to FIFO ordering when queuing and <b>signalling</b> <b>wait</b> requests. Furthermore, conditional synchronization follows the tokenpassing approach for <b>waits</b> and <b>signals</b> but utilizes a static tree for broadcasts.
