30|$|Probably {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspect of the Turkish case is that the acceptance of dual citizenship, codified in 1981, precedes all these institutional attempts. At that time, even the EU accession was at best a vague and distant goal <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> directly <b>result</b> in such a radical change. However, it can be presumed that Turkey {{has always had a}} foreign policy oriented towards Europe, and a strong interest in making itself accepted as a European country. In the subsequent decades, as Turkey developed an even stronger and a more concrete interest in creating sympathy for herself in German politics, her approach to plural citizenship also evolved (Kadirbeyoglu, 2009) from passive acceptance to active promotion, and to expressing dissatisfaction with German insistence on single citizenship.|$|R

She formulated four hypotheses: (1) that counselors imposed middle-class values on lower-class youth which did not work for the youth; (2) that boys in the treatment group became dependent on counselors and, when the program ended, the boys lost a source of support; (3) that youth in the treatment group suffered a labeling effect; and (4) that the support of the counselors raised expectations of the boys in the treatment group <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be sustained, <b>resulting</b> in disillusionment after the program completed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} Sunday 27 December 2009 to Sunday 3 January 2010, the tunnel {{closed for the}} track to be lowered to achieve W10 (freight container) route clearance. Previously, Hi Cube {{intermodal}} container traffic had to be carried on special low wagons with areas <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be loaded, <b>resulting</b> in both traffic planning issues and lower train capacity. Additionally, all container trains were restricted to 20 mph when passing through the tunnel because of the limited clearances at the top edges of the loaded containers. Since rebuilding no speed or loading restrictions apply to the tunnel and container trains can travel at up to the line speed of 40 mph, the limit for the tunnel. The work meant containers could be transported more easily by rail from the Port of Southampton.|$|R
40|$|We report {{two cases}} of {{developmental}} hyperlexia – JY and AD – who performed at normal levels or above in converting print into speech, but {{who were very}} impaired in spoken and written word comprehension. Our investigations focussed on whether these cases displayed evidence for normal acquisition of lexical reading skills, as indexed by unimpaired performance for age in reading aloud a set of irregular words, despite poor acquisition of semantic knowledge of the same words. In both cases, this dissociation was evident. The pattern of results was also demonstrated at an item level: the two cases showed {{no significant differences in}} reading accuracy for irregular words <b>which</b> they <b>could</b> define than for those <b>which</b> they <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> The <b>results</b> provide further evidence for the existence of a direct-lexical route from orthography to phonology, which is not necessarily mediated by semantic knowledge. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Priority of {{neurological}} decompression {{was regarded}} as necessary for scoliosis patients associated with Chiari I malformation in order to decrease the risk of spinal cord injury from scoliosis surgery. We report a retrospective series of scoliosis associated with Chiari I malformation in 13 adolescent patients and explore the effectiveness and safety of posterior scoliosis correction without suboccipital decompression. One-stage posterior approach total vertebral column resection was performed in seven patients with scoliosis or kyphosis curve > 90 ° (average 100. 1 ° scoliotic and 97. 1 ° kyphotic curves) or presented with apparent neurological deficits, whereas the other six patients underwent posterior pedicle screw instrumentation for correction of spinal deformity alone (average 77. 3 ° scoliotic and 44. 0 ° kyphotic curves). The apex of the scoliosis curve was located at T 7 –T 12. Mean operating time and intraoperative hemorrhage was 463  min and 5, 190  ml in patients undergoing total vertebral column resection, with average correction rate of scoliosis and kyphosis being 63. 3 and 71. 1 %, respectively. Mean operating time and intraoperative hemorrhage in patients undergoing instrumentation alone was 246  min and 1, 450  ml, with the average correction rate of scoliosis and kyphosis being 60. 8 and 53. 4 %, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 32. 2  months. No iatrogenic neurological deterioration had been encountered during the operation procedure and follow-up. After vertebral column resection, neurological dysfunctions such as relaxation of anal sphincter or hypermyotonia that occurred in three patients preoperatively improved gradually. In summary, suboccipital decompression prior to correction of spine deformity {{may not always be}} necessary for adolescent patients with scoliosis associated with Chiari I malformation. Particularly in patients with a severe and rigid curve or with significant neurological deficits, posterior approach total vertebral column resection is likely a good option, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> only <b>result</b> in satisfactory correction of deformity, but also decrease the risk of neurological injury secondary to surgical intervention by shortening spine and reducing the tension of spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Arg 8]-vasopressin (AVP) {{has several}} {{functions}} via its three distinct receptors, V 1 a, V 1 b, and V 2. The V 1 a vasopressin receptor (V 1 aR) {{is expressed in}} blood vessels and involved in vascular contraction. Recently, we generated V 1 a receptor–deficient (V 1 aR−/−) mice and found that they were hypotensive. In addition, V 1 aR−/− mice exhibited (1) blunted AVP-induced vasopressor response, (2) impaired arterial baroreceptor reflex, (3) decreased sympathetic nerve activity, and (4) decreased blood volume, all of <b>which</b> <b>could</b> contribute to the observed hypotension. In relation to their decreased blood volume, V 1 aR−/− mice had decreased plasma aldosterone levels, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>not</b> only from decreased activity of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), but also from impaired AVP-stimulated aldosterone release in the adrenal glands. V 1 aR was found to specifically co-express at the macula densa cells with cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 and with neuronal nitric oxide synthase, which produces potent stimulators of renin, PGE 2, and NO. The expression levels of renin, COX- 2, and nNOS were significantly decreased in V 1 aR−/− mice, {{which led to the}} suppression of RAS activity and consequent decreases in aldosterone and blood volume. Furthermore, V 1 aR is also expressed in collecting duct cells and involved in regulating water reabsorption by affecting V 2 /aquaporin 2 function. Thus, AVP regulates blood pressure and volume via V 1 aR by exerting diverse functions in vivo...|$|R
40|$|In this {{overview}} {{the influence}} of functional bladder disturbances and of its treatment on the resolution of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in children is discussed. Historically both bladder dysfunction entities, the overactive bladder (OAB) and the dysfunctional voiding (DV), have been described in conjunction with VUR. Treatment of the dysfunction was also considered to influence spontaneous resolution in a positive way. During the last decades, however, papers have been published <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> support these <b>results.</b> Regarding the OAB, a prospective study with treatment of the bladder overactivity with anticholinergics, did not influence spontaneous resolution rate in children with a dysfunction including also the voiding phase, DV and DES (dysfunctional elimination syndrome), most studies indicate a negative influence on the resolution rate of VUR in children, {{both before and after}} the age for bladder control, both with and without treatment. However, a couple of uncontrolled studies indicate that there is a high short-term resolution rate after treatment with flow biofeedback. It should be emphasized that the voiding phase dysfunctions (DV and DES) are more severe than the genuine filling phase dysfunction (OAB), with an increased frequency of UTI and renal damage in the former groups. To be able to answer the question if treatment of bladder dysfunction influence the resolution rate of VUR in children, randomized controlled studies must be performed. Copyright © 2008 Ulla Sillén.

40|$|Long {{before the}} {{discovery}} of plant hormone auxin, exogenous organic substances were already described as complementary to mineral nutrientes (Bottomley, 1915). In fact, even before Went in 1926 named the transmittable influence, observed by Darwin, as auxin, Bottomley (1915) suggested the term “auximones ” to designate organic extracts from peat able to promote growth. These so-called `humic-acids ` {{are likely to be}} the first descrided fer-tilizer with biostimulant proprieties, as we know to-day. However, since they were the result of an incu-bation with soil microrganisms, they differ from the humic acids modern concept. Currently there are numerous products claimed as biostimulants, much of them still lacking scientific evaluation, whilst oth-ers have already proved to work only in controlled conditions. Moreover, several works showing crop yield enhancement by biostimulants, have not ac-cessed the mode of action of such a products (for a review see Calvo et al., 2014). Many biostimulants categories have been tested, including: bacterial or microbial inoculants, biochemical materials, amino acids, humic substances and seaweed extracts. However, most of these products required miner-al fertilizer amendments to provide relevant plant production improvements in field conditions. In this regard, it is worthy to mention the potential of orga-nomineral fertilizers, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>not</b> only in satisfactory plant yield, but also in enhancing plant ability to cope with stress and other environmental challenges, through some unclear stimulant effects from its organic matter portion. While there are legal definition of plant pro-tection products and fertilizers, an equivalent legis-lation for plant biostimulants remains to be defined. In adittion, although there are guidelines on effi-cacy evaluation for the utilization and registration of plant products such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, little has been done for defining plant bi-ostimulants. Recently, private counsel from Europ...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{was begun}} in October 1996, {{with the aim}} of {{exploring}} the relationship between Cyprus television and aspects of the national and cultural identity of Cyprus youth. The thesis consists of seven chapters in all, which can be summarized as follows: In the first chapter, a survey of the historical, political and media realities in Cyprus establishes the ground for the present study, while in the second chapter, a literature review presents the writings on culture and identity, media theories and their development, with a discussion of important theoretical concepts and perspectives, like Cultural Studies, identity theory, globalisation versus localisation, postmodernism with its fragmentation and concepts of "otherness," as well as the relationship of all these concepts to Cyprus realities. A review of the relationship between television and media research to young audiences — internationally and locally - and a final discussion of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, ends Chapter two, foregrounding, at the same time, the third chapter on Methodology. The choice of the mixed paradigm — quantitative (statistical) and qualitative (Text and Discourse analysis of television programmes, and interviews and group discussions with the sample) is discussed, explained and documented in the third chapter. The fourth chapter consists of the presentation, statistical correlation and discussion of the results from the Statistical Field Survey, which rendered insights into the sample's attitudes and mapped the ground for the next two stages — the Programme analysis and the Interviews, by offering cues and clues for these stages. The fifth chapter presents a textual and discourse analysis of the first five programmes leading the sample's preference list in the Field Survey, while chapter six discusses the interviews and group discussions which were both cross-fertilized by the results of the Statistical Survey and the Programme Analysis. Finally, in the seventh chapter the conclusions from the Research are discussed {{in the light of the}} initial aims and goals of the study and suggestions are made for future research which can both derive from, and continue to add to the issues which have been investigated in the present project. The present Research Study did not aim at validating or corroborating one or more hypotheses, as it used a mixed paradigm with different methodological approaches, <b>which</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> as a <b>result</b> render thoroughly congruent or consistent results. It did seek, however, through the use of its progressive, longitudinal research model conducted at different time periods, to empirically draw to the surface, as consistently and extensively as possible, answers to the goals and aims established initially in the thesis, which answers have rendered complementary conclusions throughout the stages of the cross-paradigm used. test...|$|R
