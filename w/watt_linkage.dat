5000|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{can also}} be used to prevent axle {{movement}} in the longitudinal direction of the car. This application involves two <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkages</b> on each side of the axle, mounted parallel to the driving direction, but just a single 4-bar linkage is more common in racing suspension systems ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> and Chebyshev linkage (linkages that {{approximate}} {{straight line}} motion) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage,</b> {{a similar}} straight-line {{mechanism}} {{with the direction}} {{of one of the}} arms reversed.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{suspension}} on the sedans {{continued with}} the coil spring live axle located by {{upper and lower}} unequal length trailing arms, and a transverse <b>watts</b> <b>linkage.</b> The <b>watts</b> <b>linkage</b> had its centre pivot mounted to the differential housing carrying over the roll centre movement compromise from the XE Falcon of 1982. Falcons would be compromised by this roll centre nervousness until the discontinuation of the live axle with the BA Falcon.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{consists of a}} De Dion tube that located the wheels and which was sprung by the usual longitudinal leaf springs. The first year of production (1998) used lightweight carbon fiber monolithic leaf springs which had insufficient lateral stiffness to provide lateral location of the suspension; these early versions also featured a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b> Later versions used conventional steel leaf springs {{and did not have}} the <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{lead to the}} design of similar {{approximate}} straight-line linkages, such as Hoeken's linkage and Chebyshev's linkage.|$|R
50|$|Although the Peaucellier-Lipkin linkage, Hart's inversor, {{and other}} {{straight}} line mechanisms generate true straight-line motion, <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{has the advantage}} of much greater simplicity than these other linkages. It is similar in this respect to the Chebyshev linkage, a different linkage that produces approximate straight-line motion; however, in the case of <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage,</b> the motion is perpendicular to the line between its two endpoints, whereas in the Chebyshev linkage the motion is parallel to this line.|$|R
50|$|The Burmester linkage of 1888 is a four {{bar linkage}} part of whose coupler curve is an {{approximately}} straight line (see also <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage).</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{consists}} of a chain of three rods, two longer and equal length ones on the outside ends of the chain, connected by a short rod in the middle. The outer endpoints of the long rods are fixed in place relative to each other, and otherwise the three rods are free to pivot around the joints where they meet. Thus, counting the fixed-length connection between the outer endpoints as another bar, <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{is an example of}} a four-bar linkage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{is used in}} {{the rear}} axle of some car {{suspensions}} as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods intend to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car. <b>Watt’s</b> <b>linkage</b> approximates a vertical straight line motion more closely, and does so while locating the centre of the axle rather than toward one side of the vehicle, as more commonly used when fitting a long Panhard rod.|$|R
50|$|The linkage {{does not}} share the {{disadvantages}} of the asymmetric Panhard rod and although more compact than <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> has all the forces in one link.|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} with live-axle suspensions, where <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{is not an}} option, e.g. a number of Land Rover models use a Panhard rod {{as a component of}} the front suspension.|$|R
50|$|Visually, {{the light}} tank {{is based on}} local pattern carrier components, with four wheels per side {{individually}} sprung on a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b> The upper hull and cylindrical turret are of indigenous design.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In the 1998 model, {{carbon fiber}} leaf springs support a DeDion tube located by a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage,</b> motor/transmission is {{attached}} to chassis. Later versions have similar appearance but without the linkage ...|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam axles front and rear. The front axles are located by radius rods and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by trailing arms and <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{parallel}} motion {{differed from}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> by having an additional pantograph linkage {{incorporated in the}} design. This {{did not affect the}} fundamental principle but it allowed the engine room to be smaller because the linkage was more compact.|$|R
50|$|In a way, <b>Watt’s</b> <b>linkage</b> {{can be seen}} as two Panhard rods mounted {{opposite}} each other. In Watt’s arrangement, {{however, the}} opposing curved movements introduced by the pivoting Panhard rods largely balance each other in the short vertical rotating bar.|$|R
50|$|Debuting for 2004 {{was a new}} coil-spring rear {{suspension}} for the solid rear axle. A <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> system is fitted to the rear axle, centering the axle and reducing rear-end skate over rough surfaces, and allowing a lower and wider cargo floor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> is a four-bar linkage {{that generates}} an {{approximate}} straight line. It {{was critical to}} the operation of his design for the steam engine. This linkage also appears in vehicle suspensions to prevent side-to-side movement of the body relative to the wheels. Also see the article Parallel motion.|$|R
50|$|A beam axle's {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, semi-trailing arms, radius rods, or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a Panhard rod, a Scott Russell <b>linkage</b> or a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b> While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} of the 406 also did away with the outdated A-bracket of all previous Bristols for a more modern <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b> The 406 was the world's first production car to be thus equipped. However, the outdated front suspension of previous Bristols was retained and not updated until the following model with its more powerful drivetrain.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the curve}} crosses the origin, the origin {{is a point}} of {{inflection}} and therefore has contact of order 3 with a tangent. However, if a2=b2+<c2 [...] then tangent has contact of order 5 with the tangent, in other words the curve is a close approximation of a straight line. This is the basis for <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{can be found}} on the high and {{intermediate}} pressure piston rod of the 1865 Crossness engines. In these engines, the low pressure piston rod uses the more conventional parallel motion linkage, but the high and intermediate pressure rod does not connect to the end of the beam so there is no requirement to save space.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{suspension}} {{was of the}} De Dion type, with the unusual feature that, to restrain the tube from side-to-side movement, its tube had a small wheel at its midpoint that rolled in a vertical channel {{on the front of}} the differential (which in a De Dion system is bolted to the chassis) instead of using a <b>Watts</b> <b>linkage</b> or a Panhard rod.|$|R
50|$|Beam :Central column style beam engine with <b>Watt's</b> {{parallel}} <b>linkage,</b> bore 1 inch, stroke 2 inches.|$|R
50|$|For its {{redesign}} in the 1998 model year, the Lincoln Town Car {{retained the}} Ford Panther platform that had underpinned its predecessor. To improve the cornering {{stability of the}} Town Car, a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> was fitted to the solid rear axle suspension (a change also seen in its Mercury and Ford counterparts). The front brake calipers were changed to a larger dual-piston design; 16-inch wheels became standard.|$|R
50|$|This curve can be {{obtained}} as the inverse transform of a hyperbola, with the inversion circle centered {{at the center of}} the hyperbola (bisector of its two foci). It may also be drawn by a mechanical linkage in the form of <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage,</b> with the lengths of the three bars of the linkage and the distance between its endpoints chosen to form a crossed square.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to his son in 1808 {{describing}} how he arrived at the design, James Watt wrote [...] "I am more proud of the parallel motion than of any other invention I have ever made." [...] The sketch he included actually shows what is now known as <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> which was a <b>linkage</b> described in <b>Watt's</b> 1784 patent but it was immediately superseded by the parallel motion.|$|R
50|$|The SP8 is Mamod's first beam engine, {{introduced}} in 2013. It {{uses the same}} double acting piston valve cylinder as used in other recent models, which is mounted vertically under {{one end of the}} beam, connected to it using a simulated <b>Watts</b> <b>linkage.</b> The crankshaft and flywheel are mounted under the other end. The valve gear is controlled via a second smaller beam. The SP8 is offered with optional gas or solid fuel burner.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> (also {{known as}} the {{parallel}} linkage) {{is a type of}} mechanical linkage invented by James Watt (19 January 1736 [...] - [...] 25 August 1819) in which the central moving point of the linkage is constrained to travel on an approximation to a straight line. It was described in Watt's patent specification of 1784 for the Watt steam engine. It is also used in automobile suspensions, allowing the axle of a vehicle to travel vertically while preventing sideways motion.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Ford {{significantly}} upgraded {{the exterior}} designs {{of all three}} Panther platform cars. The Town Car received the most extensive changes with its entire body being restyled. To increase parts commonality between the two, the Crown Victoria was redesigned to share the rear roofline (and much of the exterior sheetmetal) with the Grand Marquis, which saw minor cosmetic changes itself. Underneath the sheetmetal, a <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage</b> {{was added to the}} rear suspension (still a live rear axle) in an effort to improve handling.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Panhard rod is its simplicity. Its major disadvantage is that the axle must necessarily move in an arc relative to the body, with the radius equal {{to the length of}} the Panhard rod. If the rod is too short, it allows excessive sideways movement between the axle and the body at the ends of the spring travel. Therefore, the Panhard rod is less desirable on smaller cars than larger ones. A suspension design that is similar but dramatically reduces the sideways component of the axle's vertical travel is <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{experimental}} {{results on the}} control of seismic attenuators and inertial platforms with horizontal monolithic sensors based on the classical folded pendulum architecture (<b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage),</b> taking ad- vantage {{of some of its}} peculiar characteristics like compactness and robustness coupled to resonance frequency tunability and high sensitivity over a large measurement band. We show that the main resonant frequencies of the inertial platform used for the tests, located in the frequency band 0. 01 ± 10 Hz, can be controlled with horizontal monolithic folded pendulums configured as seismometers (inertial sensors), presenting and discussing the control approach and the results...|$|R
50|$|Refined {{over several}} decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900's double {{wishbone}} suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel. The rear suspension comprised a typical beam axle design, stabilized with a Panhard rod. However, the attachment points between the axle and chassis made up an unusual configuration that, in essence, {{consists of two}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkages</b> {{at either end of}} the axle: A lower control arm attaches the axle to the bottom of the vehicle, while an upper link attaches at the top but faces towards the rear, unlike a typical 4-link design with both lower and upper links facing forward.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1700s {{the steam}} engine was of growing importance, and James Watt {{realized}} that efficiency could be increased by using different cylinders for expansion and condensation of the steam. This drove {{his search for}} a linkage that could transform rotation of a crank into a linear slide, and resulted in his discovery {{of what is called}} <b>Watt's</b> <b>linkage.</b> This led to the study of linkages that could generate straight lines, even if only approximately; and inspired the mathematician J. J. Sylvester, who lectured on the Peaucellier linkage, which generates an exact straight line from a rotating crank.|$|R
