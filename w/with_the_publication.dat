5|$|Because of his {{willingness}} to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex and lesbianism, Moore's novels were initially met with disapproval. However, as the public's taste for realist fiction grew, this subsided. Moore began to find success as an art critic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> of books such as Impressions and Opinions (1891) and Modern Painting (1893)—which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.|$|E
5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of feminism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E

After Virtue renewed Either/Or as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E

The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, with books, films, and television shows.

40|$|Background <b>The</b> {{scholarly}} <b>publication</b> {{landscape is}} changing rapidly. We investigated whether {{the introduction of}} an institutional publications officer might help facilitate better knowledge of publication topics and related resources, and effectively support researchers to publish. Methods In September 2015, a purpose-built survey about researchers’ knowledge and perceptions of publication practices was administered at five Ottawa area research institutions. Subsequently, we publicly announced a newly hired publications officer (KDC) who then began conducting outreach at two of the institutions. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer gave presentations, held one-to-one consultations, developed electronic newsletter content, and generated and maintained a webpage of resources. In March 2016, we re-surveyed our participants regarding their knowledge and perceptions of publishing. Mean scores to the perception questions, and the percent of correct responses to the knowledge questions, pre and post survey, were computed for each item. The difference between these means or calculated percentages was then examined across the survey measures. Results 82 participants completed both surveys. Of this group, 29 {{indicated that they had}} exposure to <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer, while <b>the</b> remaining 53 indicated they did not. Interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer led to improvements in half of the knowledge items (7 / 14 variables). While improvements in knowledge of publishing were also found among those who reported not to have interacted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer (9 / 14), these effects were often smaller in magnitude. Scores for some publication knowledge variables actually decreased between the pre and post survey (3 / 14). Effects for researchers’ perceptions of publishing increased for 5 / 6 variables in the group that interacted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer. Discussion This pilot provides initial indication that, in a short timeframe, introducing an institutional publications officer may improve knowledge and perceptions surrounding publishing. This study is limited by its modest sample size and temporal relationship between the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer and changes in knowledge and perceptions. A randomized trial examining <b>the</b> <b>publications</b> officer as an effective intervention is needed...|$|R
