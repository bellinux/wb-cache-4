And {{we talked about it}} a number of times over the season, and we had different versions and different ideas how to get there....at a time when Coulson's at his most vulnerable, {{it seemed to be a}} good choice for us." [...] Concerning the character of Blackout, Bell stated that [...] "He’s the antagonist, in the same way we’ve used other Marvel characters as antagonists in the episodes. At the same time, we’re dealing with the fall-out of what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D., and the viewers finding out about Ward and what’s going on over there, so there’s a lot going on. Emotionally, he’s perfect. Here’s a character who absorbs light, and one of the things he says to Audrey - which is the title of the episode - he refers to her as “the only light in the darkness.” And his obsession with the cellist is a beautiful metaphor, I think, for who Coulson is to her, who she is to Coulson, who S.H.I.E.L.D. is to the world…and the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. falling apart, and Hydra coming out and darkness speaking, the idea of having Blackout as an antagonist seemed perfect." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{day after}} being waived by the Colts, Forsett was re-signed to the {{practice}} squad of the Seattle Seahawks on October 9, 2008. Forsett was then signed from the practice squad on October 14, 2008 and became the return specialist. For the 2009 season, he was slated to compete with Julius Jones and Edgerrin James for touches in a crowded Seahawks backfield. After the release of Edgerrin James, Forsett became the teams No. 2 back which gave him {{an opportunity to get}} more touches and make a bigger on-the-field impact. On November 15, Julius Jones, the starting running back for the Seahawks, left a game against the Arizona Cardinals with a bruised lung. Forsett filled in for Jones, rushing for 123 yards and his first regular season touchdown. He started as the primary running back on November 22 game against the Minnesota Vikings, scoring his second touchdown on a 9-yard run. With the Seahawks' running game struggling, Forsett also caught 8 passes for 80 yards. On November 29 against the St. Louis Rams, he rushed for a career-high 130 yards and two scores. With the return of Julius Jones in week 13 against the San Francisco 49ers, Forsett was relegated back to the position of 2nd-string running-back. He saw only 8 touches, rushing for a net gain of 9 yards, reception of 25 yards, and one touchdown. When asked if Forsett will be elevated to the position of the primary running back for the Seattle Seahawks, Coach Jim Mora responded,"You'll see them both and we like them both." [...] But Mora confirmed that Forsett will see more touches, [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of Justin? The answer is yes, absolutely." ...|$|E
5000|$|In this hugely {{international}} {{episode of}} Walt Disney World Inside Out, Scott Herriot is your host and multilenguist. Today, {{he takes the}} viewers {{on a tour of}} World Showcase at Epcot '94.Then the announcer Marc Elliot fills us in with what else Scott is doing in this episode. So pack your bags, grab your passports and [...] "keep your arms and legs inside the sofa at all times" [...] because we're heading off on a journey to visit 11 countries in [...] "27 and a half minutes". First Scott heads to Disney-MGM-Studios to ride Star Tours. His mission: Save the universe [...] "without messing up his hair". After interviewing guests waiting in line as well as a cast member who told Scott that the first time he put on the shirt that he was wearing he felt that he [...] "looked like a parking cone", Scott goes on the ride but before the ride began Scott said [...] "May the force be with you, live long and prosper and Remember the Alamo". After the ride Scott asks some kids where the restrooms are. Scott begins his tour of World Showcase starting in Germany. Scott says that Germany [...] "makes you think of cities like Hamburg, Friedberg, Steven Spielberg, me in lederhosen". Then Scott talks to Patrick Hanfert and Katrin Schnadt two of the cast members in Germany. Then Scott gives out the first of four international questions about Germany. [...] "Lederhosen translates literally to leather pants and your question is: Do you think I should wear them more often?". Both Katrin and Patrick said [...] "No" [...] and [...] "Absolutely not". Scott asks how Germans say Mickey Mouse which leads into the next segment that deals with Mickey Mania the Magic Kingdom's then-newest parade. Then Scott travels to Japan and talks to two more cast members. He also gives the second question: [...] "Godzilla. Do you think that he should be a good running mate in 1996?". The two cast members didn't come up with an answer so Scott heads on down to Discovery Island [...] " [...] a huge island zoo and anyone can come and see it. It's a place full of wild animals and strange sounds. A place not unlike my own dressing room". After Scott disembarked the boat, Kim Murphy The Walt Disney Company's corporate V.P. for environmental policy shows Scott around the island (including the Birds of Prey show area). In a remote segment, Howie Mandel interviews guests and goes onto the Backlot Studio tour. Scott then continues the World Showcase adventure by going to Mexico. Then Scott asks the 3rd international question: [...] "With all the countries in World Showcase, how are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them all {{before the end of the}} program?" [...] The correct answer was [...] "The Cool Camera Effect". Scott heads on down to Disney's Port Orleans Resort to see and interview Denny Zavett. (Later he played the kazoo) Scott goes to Innoventions to interview guests and make phone calls. The last stop of Scott's World Showcase adventure is the United Kingdom where he interviews cast members Chris Larmour and Pauline Chinnison. Then we take a look at the calendar to check up on what's coming in the months ahead at Walt Disney World.|$|E

Those using, or working on, IT were referred to as 'the lunatic fringe ' by those in conventional telephony. Today, Internet Telephony is accepted as mainstream technology. IT has become the logical successor to the circuit switched telephony that evolved over the past 125 years. What is Internet Telephony and why has this rapid change happened?

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{inflammatory}} response has seen a tremendous expansion over the last 30 years. Advancements in technology and better knowledge of the ethiopathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions have facilitated this process allowing researchers to almost reach the core of problem. Thus, {{we now know that}} inflammation can be manifested in many different ways depending on the context that has elicited it. Viral and infectious, allergic and autoimmune, carcinogenic and resolutive are just a few examples of how inflammation can disguise itself. However, and most intriguingly, it appears that the more we try to discover "an ideal target" and delineate borders for a specific class of inflammatory conditions the more we find similarities, overlaps or often links that we did not predict. These somehow disappointing findings have pushed researchers towards a frantic search for new and more "reliable" targets. As result, we have recently seen a surge of many novel mediators of inflammation. If we just limit our focus to inflammatory cytokines, the main topic of this commentary, the list seems never-ending: IL- 15, IL- 17, IL- 18, IL- 21, IL- 22, IL- 23, IL- 27 and IL- 33. Are these cytokines destined to supersede prostaglandins and other autacoids for their key role in inflammation? Are <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a cheap and effective alternative to aspirin on the supermarket shelves in the next few years? Here we summarize the most recent findings on the biological effects of these new inflammatory cytokines and discuss how these discoveries might influence our current view on therapeutic approaches to treat inflammatio...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} European Court of Justice {{delivered}} its Laval judgment on 18 December 2007, {{the name of}} this small Latvian company has become notorious. The sole mention of ‘Viking and Laval’ has become short-hand for those critical of a certain idea of Europe giving primacy to economic considerations to the detriment of ‘social Europe’. This article intends {{to go back to the}} original Laval judgment to reconstruct its history and deconstruct its myth. The Viking and Laval judgments have been criticized for using freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services respectively as ‘trumps’ against the fundamental right of freedom of association and collective action. What protection for the right to strike after what the Court decided, one was inclined to ask? Were <b>we</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> social dumping become the norm, a race to the bottom that would see Eastern European workers compete against their Western counterparts by offering their low labour cost as their best asset? These are crucial questions and they have justly been discussed extensively elsewhere. This article considers the Laval judgment, and explores a different angle, by taking as its starting point Habermas’ theory of discursive practices as guarantees for a democratic outcome and offering the Swedish system of collective agreements as a substantiation of such practices. In this context, the article argues, the comprehensive dismissal by the Court of the carefully constructed and balanced system of social dialogue between management and labour is truly the most disturbing aspect of this controversial judgment. For all the supposed importance placed on discursive practices and social dialogue for the European social model, when confronted with a successful example of such model, the Court retreated in the familiar territory of hard law and statutory obligations. In doing so, it willfully misunderstood the function of collective bargaining, by effectively decoupling its process from its function, and leaving social dialogue with the hollow role of a deliberative practice devoid of any finality, the very openness of which both signifies and nullifies its democratic credentials.,</p...|$|E
