5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of masonry with cool nighttime air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E

5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> tone and sensitivity.|$|E

Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010.

5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of a semi-permanent high-pressure area known as the North Pacific High in the eastern Pacific is a dominant factor against formation of tropical cyclones in the winter, as the Pacific High results in wind shear that causes environmental conditions for tropical cyclone formation to be unconducive. Its effects in the central Pacific basin are usually related to keeping cyclones away from the Hawaiian Islands. Due to westward trade winds, hurricanes in the Pacific nearly never head eastward, although several storms have defied the odds and headed eastward. A second factor preventing tropical cyclones from forming during the winter is the occupation of a semi-permanent low-pressure area designated the Aleutian Low between January and April. Its presence over western Canada and the northwestern United States contributes to the area's occurrences of precipitation in that duration. In addition, its effects in the central Pacific near 160°W causes tropical waves that form {{in the area to}} drift northward into the Gulf of Alaska and dissipate. Its retreat in late-April allows the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific High to meander in, bringing its powerful clockwise wind circulation with it. The Intertropical Convergence Zone departs southward in mid-May permitting the formation of the earliest tropical waves, coinciding with the start of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on May15.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the <b>warmth</b> <b>of</b> the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: the quilt top, the middle layer of batting, and the fabric backing. The quilt top is the design layer.
