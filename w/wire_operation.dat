As a reflection of its enforced departure from the Katanga Province, the new, simplified name Union Minière was adopted. With its more European focus, Union Minière began to grow its business again through the 1980s, initially largely organically. In 1989 however, Société Générale announced plans to merge Union Minière with three other Belgian metals companies in which it held a significant stake: zinc producer Vieille Montagne (with a history stretching back to 1805); Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, which dealt {{in a wide range of}} metals including copper, cobalt, and lead; and Mechim, an engineering firm. The much enlarged company was initially renamed Acec-Union Minière (although the prefix was dropped in 1992) and subsequently set about streamlining its organisational structure, but the global economic downturn of the early-to-mid-1990s hit profits and forced management to implement a major restructuring programme in 1995. The three-year plan, implemented under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Karel Vinck, involved the loss of around 25% of Union Minière's workforce and the sale of a number of non-core assets, including a zinc <b>wire</b> <b>operation,</b> French roofing material retailer Asturienne and much of the company's exposure to the diamond products sector (including Diamant Boart).|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual <b>wire</b> <b>operation</b> and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|E

30|$|If {{the wire}} path that bends {{at the center}} of the pitch axis can be constructed, the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires {{accompanying}} the pitch axis motion does not change. However, considering the durability of the wire and smooth <b>wire</b> <b>operation,</b> the bending wire path at the center is not adopted because it is necessary to maintain the radius. On the other hand, in the proposed wrist mechanism, arc-shaped guides are located on the upper and lower portions of the plane, including the pitch axis and the central axis of the supporting part. The arc-shaped guide provides sufficient bending radius of the wire and minimizes the change in the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires arising from pitch axis motion. Compared with the case of using pulleys, there is concern about friction between the wire and circular arc-shaped surface, but the bending radius of the wire can be greatly increased and the number of parts can be greatly reduced.|$|E
40|$|As {{semiconductor}} technology {{advances in the}} ultra deep sub -micron era, on-chip global interconnections have been an ever-greater barrier to achieving high-performance and low -power for the increasingly larger system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Various on-chip interconnection schemes are proposed to tackle the scaling issue of global wires by manipulating the <b>wire</b> <b>operation</b> regions, changing signaling methods, and applying different equalization techniques. Optimization frameworks are also proposed to aid the transmitter-wire-receiver co-design based on user- defined constraints. For the six representative global interconnection schemes, we investigate their performance metrics with technology scaling by performing optimizations using the proposed SQP-based framework. A set of simple models is also developed to enable early- stage system-level analysis. Performance of different interconnection schemes are predicted and compared over several technology nodes. We further perform studies on the pipelined $RC$ interconnection by exploring its performance metrics with voltage and technology scaling based on different design objectives. A performance evaluation flow is developed to generate the optimal designs for given objectives. Also, impacts of pipelining depth, voltage and technology scaling are illustrated. Finally, we propose an energy-efficient high-speed on-chip global interconnection by employing continuous-time active equalization. Modeling and design of transmitter and receiver circuits are discussed. Analytical formula of received eye-opening is derived for system-level design planning. We further perform transmitter-receiver co- design through an optimization framework and explore the design space to generate design based on best energy- throughput tradeof...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} fine {{unheated}} wire {{for making}} shock tube flow measurements is investigated. The operation of the instrument depends on the transient nature of the shock tube flow. The wire is referred to here as a cold wire; it operates in a non-steady manner which is completely different from the usual hot <b>wire</b> <b>operation.</b> This report describes the construction and calibration of the cold wire. The experimental law for the rate of gain of heat to the wire in air is determined over a range of Mach numbers from 0. 4 to 1. 9 {{and a range of}} Reynolds numbers from 0. 035 to 3, 500 based on the wire diameter and the conditions in the hot flow following the initial shock wave. Similar measurements are reported for argon. The heat transfer measurements cover the continuum region, the slip and transitional regions, and extend into the free-molecule flow region. The dimensionless results are compared with hot wire measurements obtained in wind tunnels and are found to differ slightly. A difference exists because the cold wire gains heat from the fluid while the hot wire loses heat to the fluid. The measurements are very repeatable and self-consistent, and they indicate that the wire can be used to give an accurate flow measurement in the shock tube.

We present applicable technologies from robotics research, which could be used to develop novel autonomous marine research gear, which may be deployed independently and/or simultaneously with traditional wired equipment. A variety of technological advancements make such ventures feasible and timely.
