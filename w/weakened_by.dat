5|$|Although his {{links to}} Bulgarian culture were <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> his father's departure, Cerna, who was baptized in the Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church, became fluent in Bulgarian.

5|$|As Helene {{recurved}} {{and accelerated}} towards more northerly latitudes, it steadily <b>weakened.</b> <b>By</b> 1200 UTC on September 28, Helene {{was no longer}} a major hurricane. The hurricane's wind field also expanded from the storm's center as it <b>weakened.</b> <b>By</b> midday on September 29, Helene had weakened to minimal hurricane strength, and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds. At roughly the same time, Helene passed over Newfoundland, with gale force winds having expanded 500 mi (800 km) from the system's center, coinciding with the US Weather Bureau's final advisory on the system. Helene's extratropical remnants continued eastward across the Atlantic, becoming a dominant synoptic feature, before entirely dissipating by 0600 UTC on October 4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{shielding}} gas in arc welding processes on materials that at welding temperatures are contaminated and <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> air or nitrogen. A number of inert {{shielding gas}}es are used in gas tungsten arc welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the defenders. The defenders were also <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E

5|$|On July22, the IMD began {{monitoring}} {{a depression}} over the Bay of Bengal. Tracking west-northwest, the system intensified into a cyclonic storm {{later that day}} before making landfall in Andhra Pradesh, just north of Vishakhapatnam. Once onshore the storm accelerated towards the northwest and <b>weakened.</b> <b>By</b> July24, {{the remnants of the}} cyclone were located over the state of Maharashtra. The system was last noted the following day over Gujarat and moving into Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|The Muslim siege {{forces had}} been <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> the {{withdrawal}} of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force.

5|$|The Social Credit Party was <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> {{considerable}} {{conflict between}} its {{organizations in the}} two provinces it controlled, Alberta and British Columbia. It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups. However, it was better financed than the CCF, due to its popularity among business groups in the West.|$|E

5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> the hostility of their Roman subjects, the {{continued}} existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the Qarmatians at Hama also {{opened the way for}} the Abbasids to recover the provinces of {{southern}} Syria and Egypt, held by the Tulunids. The Tulunid regime had already been <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> internal strife and the rivalries of the various ethnic groups in the army, which led to the defection of the commander Badr al-Hammami and other senior officers to the Abbasids; the regime was further <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> the destructive raids of the Qarmatians and its inability to deal with it. On 24 May 904, Muhammad ibn Sulayman left Baghdad at the head of an army, numbering 10,000 according to al-Tabari, and tasked with recovering southern Syria and Egypt itself from the Tulunids. His campaign was to be assisted from the sea by a fleet from the frontier districts of Cilicia under Damian of Tarsus. Damian led a fleet up the river Nile, raided its coasts, and prevented supplies for the Tulunid forces from being ferried over it.|$|E

50|$|HURDAT {{indicates}} that a tropical storm originated to the northeast of the Windward Islands on September 11. Steadily tracking towards the west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified, reaching its peak intensity with winds estimated at 60 mph (95 km/h) on September 13. After turning northwestward, the system slowed and began to <b>weaken.</b> <b>By</b> September 16, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats. After turning to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of , followed by executing a clockwise loop from September16 through September18. After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm <b>weakened,</b> <b>by</b> which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. The storm dissipated on September21 just off the Georgia coast.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was first identified as a tropical storm several hundred miles southeast of Hawaii on September9.

Later that day, the system entered an area with no ships available for reporting. However, no ships reported a storm in the region for several days, signifying the depression's dissipation.|$|R
