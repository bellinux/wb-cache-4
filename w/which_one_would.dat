Because Tony Peña, the Royals' manager, was unable to decide <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be the ace, he flipped a coin to determine who would be number one. Hernández won the toss.|$|E
5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and stood near the central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E
5|$|It Takes a Church is an American dating {{game show}} hosted by Natalie Grant and {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. The show travels to multiple churches {{across the country}} looking for single members of congregations looking for a partner. The congregation {{of the church is}} primarily in charge of looking at potential daters and judging <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be the best match. The first season, sponsored by Christian Mingle, began airing on June 5, 2014. The series was later renewed for a second season, which began airing March 26, 2015.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-year}} {{absence from the}} Copa Libertadores, Atlético {{qualified}} for the 1981 edition as runner-up of the 1980 Campeonato Brasileiro, which it had lost to Flamengo. The refereeing in the finals had been controversial, as Atlético forward Reinaldo was sent off with a straight red card after scoring a brace. Brazil's representatives were once again drawn into Group 3, together with Olimpia and Cerro Porteño, whom Atlético faced {{for a second time}} in a group stage of the Libertadores. The two encounters between the Brazilian clubs ended 22, and both won two and drew two matches against the Paraguayans, meaning Atlético and Flamengo were tied on points. According to the competition's rules, a one-game playoff in a neutral stadium had to be played between the clubs to decide <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> advance to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three days, the group {{undertook}} a series of tasks by which they could earn the right to become housemates. The remaining non-housemates were instructed to change into a special uniform. Anyone not obeying would lose {{the opportunity to become}} a housemate. Lisa gained housemate status {{in the early hours of}} Day 2 when she answered a ringing phone in the living room. Given 15 minutes to select the fourth housemate, she chose Kris. Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

25|$|A {{prospective}} study is forward-looking and includes subjects {{who did not}} originally have symptoms of the disease being studied. Many retrospective, or backward-looking, studies might take a group of alcoholics and try to determine what common traits might have caused their alcoholism.

Chamber pots were in common use in Europe from ancient times, even being taken to the Middle East by medieval pilgrims.|$|E
25|$|The R22s were {{fitted with}} {{different}} types of brake shoes, to see <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> negotiate the rail joints better. It was eventually found that the automated trip took 10 seconds longer than manual operation (about 95 seconds, compared to 85 seconds). As the tests on the Sea Beach line progressed, grade time stops were added to ensure safety on the line, and on the 42nd Street line. The train was dubbed SAM, and was to operate on Track 4 of the shuttle line.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, {{due to the}} Internet and the {{beginning}} of e-commerce, it was possible for Southeast Asian consumers to purchase items from American and European companies that would be delivered in their countries. The dot-com companies’ stock prices skyrocketed, and native companies felt they needed to catch up to the other high selling e-commerce countries, choosing to underestimate the risks of launching many e-companies and letting the market decide <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>would</b> succeed.|$|R
50|$|The People's Manifesto {{formed a}} part of Thomas {{stand-up}} tour entitled It's The Stupid Economy. Before the show and during the interval people wrote down their ideas for policies, {{with help from the}} campaign group NO2ID. Thomas would then go through the policies, deciding <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>would</b> be considered for the manifesto and <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> should be immediately rejected. At the end of the show, the public were asked to vote for the best policy by shouting out loudly in support of the policies, the winning one being formed as part of the manifesto.|$|R
50|$|One Spark was {{conceived}} in 2011 by Elton Rivas, Dennis Eusebio, and Varick Rosete, three young professionals involved in Jacksonville's startup scene. Inspired by Brad Feld's book Startup Communities, Rivas wanted to develop Jacksonville's startup culture rather than moving elsewhere. The organizers modeled One Spark after events like ArtPrize and South by Southwest, planning a festival where inventors, entrepreneurs, and artists could present their projects, with attendees voting on <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>would</b> receive the prize money.|$|R
25|$|The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation (commonly called Penance, Reconciliation, or Confession) {{is one of}} {{the seven}} sacraments of the Catholic Church (called sacred mysteries in the Eastern Catholic Churches), in which the {{faithful}} obtain absolution for the sins committed against God and neighbour and are reconciled with the community of the Church. By this sacrament Christians are freed from sins committed after Baptism. The sacrament of Penance is considered the normal way to be absolved from mortal sin, by <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> otherwise condemn oneself to Hell.|$|E
25|$|The Montreal {{municipal}} administration asked municipalities of the South Shore of the Saint Lawrence River <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be interested by the Metro and Longueuil got the link. Line 4 (Yellow Line) therefore pass under the river, from Berri-de-Montigny station, junction of lines 1 and 2, to Longueuil. A stop was added in between {{to access the}} site of Expo 67, built on two islands of the Hochelaga Archipelago in the river. Saint Helen's Island, on which the station {{of the same name}} was built, was massively enlarged and consolidated with several nearby islands (including Ronde Island) using backfill excavated during the construction of the Metro. Notre Dame Island, adjacent, was created from scratch with the same material. Line 4 was completed on April 1, 1967, in time for the opening of the World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|Vaughan's main {{interests}} lay in {{the early}} history of Wales and in genealogy. Though these were common enough pursuits for the rural gentry of the time, Vaughan devoted himself to them with great energy and diligence, {{as well as to the}} collection of early manuscripts and books which he amassed at Hengwrt, preserving many unique texts which might otherwise have been lost. He was able to increase his holdings further after making an arrangement with the calligrapher and manuscript collector John Jones of Gellilyfdy, Flintshire, in <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> combine both collections on the other's death. Vaughan also transcribed texts himself, carried out genealogical research, made an English translation of the Brut y Tywysogion (or Chronicle of the Princes), and wrote several short historical tracts as well as the book British Antiquities Revived, first published at Oxford in 1662.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} amount of handaxes {{found at the}} site, Kariandusi was {{once thought to be}} a factory for Acheulean handaxes. It was also once thought of as one of the oldest in situ Acheulean hand axe site in the world. When it was discovered, the {{researchers}} believed it had been untouched since the last stoneworker had left. However, recent climate research has revealed that nearby Lake Elmenteita once reached further inland, and has receded in the past one million years. The collection at Kariandusi accumulated due to the water rushing over the land and depositing the hand axes there. The denial of this site as a factory is supported by the lack of waste found at the site. There are no flakes or debris left over from the creation of the handaxes, <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be sure to find at a designated factory.|$|E
25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is not wrong. The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would,</b> under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E

The show was supposed to air after the completion of the second season of Heroes in April 2008; however, on October 31, 2007, it was reported that Origins had been postponed because of the Writers Guild of America strike. Kring stated in an interview that the first episode of Origins was to reveal the secrets and meanings behind the Helix symbol. However, because of the WGA Strike, Kring commented that the secret will have to be revealed down the line. Kring revealed that he was to write the first episode of Origins, and that John August had been hired to write another episode. Director Kevin Smith, a fan of Heroes, was set to write and direct an episode for the spin-off, as were Eli Roth and Michael Dougherty. On April 3, 2008, a day after NBC announced its 2008–2009 primetime schedule, Ben Silverman confirmed Originss cancellation.|$|E

Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, [...] "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say, 'Now <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> you like?' Nothing I can count on and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting."

Due to this title sequence, viewers were left virtually unaware that Ullman was playing every character, or for that matter, <b>which</b> <b>one(s).</b> For the show's second season, a new title sequence was created, along with a new opening format. The new opening that preceded the new title sequence consisted of a monologue or interview given by Ullman. The new title sequence features Ullman and her cast of characters lip-synching to her 1983 hit song, [...] "They Don't Know."

30|$|These {{studies are}} {{generally}} not explicit about the exact transmission channel from one sector {{to the other and}} tend to capture different dynamics that are at play at the same time. Results can be interpreted more easily if one or more potential transmission channels are first identified and then modelled in the empirical analysis. This is one of the specific objectives of the present paper. We identify below potential market-driven and institutional channels, stressing <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>would</b> be more relevant for the interaction going from the government to the private sector and <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> matter for movements in the opposite direction. Subsequently, we propose a simple method for testing empirically the strength of the market channel as well as of one specific institutional channel.|$|R
