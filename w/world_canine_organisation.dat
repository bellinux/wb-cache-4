40|$|Dogs (Canis familiaris) were domesticated {{from the}} gray wolf (Canis lupus) at least 14, 000 years ago, {{and there is}} {{evidence}} of dogs with phenotypes similar to those in modern breeds 4000 years ago. However, recent genetic analyses have suggested that modern dog breeds have a much more recent origin, probably < 200 years ago. To study the origin of contemporaneous breeds we combined the analysis of paternally inherited Y chromosome markers with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA and biparentally inherited autosomal microsatellite markers in both domestic dogs and their wild ancestor, the gray wolf. Our results show a sex bias in the origin of breeds, with fewer males than females contributing genetically, which clearly differs from the breeding patterns in wild gray wolf populations where both sexes have similar contributions. Furthermore, a comparison of mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome diversity in dog groups recognized by the <b>World</b> <b>Canine</b> Organization, as well as in groups defined by the breeds' genetic composition, shows that paternal lineages are more differentiated among groups than maternal lineages. This demonstrates a lower exchange of males than of females between breeds belonging to different groups, which illustrates how breed founders may have been chosen...|$|R

40|$|American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH) is a tick-borne {{disease that}} is {{spreading}} {{in the southeastern}} and south-central United States. Characterized by marked leukocytosis and periosteal bone proliferation, ACH is very debilitating and often fatal. Dogs acquire infection by ingesting nymphal or adult Gulf Coast ticks (Amblyomma maculatum) that, in a previous life stage, ingested the parasite in a blood meal taken from some vertebrate intermediate host. ACH {{is caused by the}} apicomplexan Hepatozoon americanum and has been differentiated from Old <b>World</b> <b>canine</b> hepatozoonosis caused by H. canis. Unlike H. canis, which is transmitted by the ubiquitous brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), H. americanum is essentially an accidental parasite of dogs, for which Gulf Coast ticks are not favored hosts. The geographic portrait of the disease parallels the known distribution of the Gulf Coast tick, which has expanded in recent years. Thus, the endemic cycle of H. americanum involves A. maculatum as definitive host and some vertebrate intermediate host(s) yet to be identified. Although coyotes (Canis latrans) are known to be infected, it is not known how important this host is in maintaining the endemic cycle. This review covers the biology of the parasite and of the tick that transmits it and contrasts ACH with classical canine hepatozoonosis. Clinical aspects of the disease are discussed, including diagnosis and treatment, and puzzling epidemiologic issues are examined. Brief consideration is given to the potential for ACH {{to be used as a}} model for study of angiogenesis and of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy...|$|R

40|$|Over the <b>world,</b> <b>canine</b> species, {{including}} the gray wolf, have been gradually endangered or extinct. Many {{efforts have been}} made to recover and conserve these canids. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce the endangered gray wolf with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for conservation. Adult ear fibroblasts from a female gray wolf (Canis lupus) were isolated and cultured in vitro as donor cells. Because of limitations in obtaining gray wolf matured oocytes, in vivo matured canine oocytes obtained by flushing the oviducts from the isthmus to the in-fundibulum were used. After removing the cumulus cells, the oocyte was enucleated, mi-croinjected, fused with a donor cell, and activated. The reconstructed cloned wolf embryos were transferred into the oviducts of the naturally synchronized surrogate mothers. Two preg-nancies were detected by ultrasonography at 23 days of gestation in recipient dogs. In each surrogate dog, two fetal sacs were confirmed by early pregnancy diagnosis at 23 days, but only two cloned wolves were delivered. The first cloned wolf was delivered by cesarean sec-tion on October 18, 2005, 60 days after embryo transfer. The second cloned wolf was deliv-ered on October 26, 2005, at 61 days postembryo transfer. Microsatellite analysis was per-formed with genomic DNA from the donor wolf, the two cloned wolves, and the two surrogate female recipients to confirm the genetic identity of the cloned wolves. Analysis of 19 mi-crosatellite loci confirmed that the cloned wolves were genetically identical to the donor wolf. In conclusion, we demonstrated live birth of two cloned gray wolves by nuclear transfer of wolf somatic cells into enucleated canine oocyte, indicating that SCNT is a practical approach for conserving endangered canids...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a secondary {{research}} focused on a Czech national breed, the Chodský Dog breed. The first section outlines {{the history of}} the breed and its restoration, which officially began in 1984 by Jan Findejs. Its breeders are joined in the Association of Friends of the Chodský Dog breed, one of the largest breeders associations. On the 31 st March 2016 there were 152 registered breeding kennels in Europe. The breed is also very popular abroad where a few official broods have already been reared. It has the strongest presence in Germany and Switzerland. The Association of Friends of the Chodský Dog breed is a member of the Bohemian-Moravian Cynology Union. The organisation still awaits the breed acknowledgement by <b>World</b> <b>Canine</b> Organization (FCI). The subsequent part of the paper concentrates on genetics of the population and includes an assessment of outcomes associated with hip joint dysplasia and its incidence in the population since 2001. In addition to dysplasia, which is being monitored and eliminated by the association, the breed is not significantly affected by other diseases. The health programme and other health checks promoted by the association are also discussed. The last section describes dog character trait tests and character traits specific to the Chodský Dog breed. An analysis of traits was carried out based on data collected from the associations database. The offspring of the five most fertile dogs were also assessed. Furthermore, the thesis discusses the results of the breeds athletic performance and its use in zootherapy. It highlights the breeds wide range of potential uses and its acclaimed character traits. Chodský Dog breed have become popular in recent years. The breed registry logs around 300 puppies, every year, suggesting the breed is doing well...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Capillaria aerophila, Capillaria boehmi and Trichuris vulpis are trichuroid {{nematodes}} affecting {{wild and}} companion animals {{all over the}} <b>World.</b> The <b>canine</b> intestinal whipworm, T. vulpis, {{is the most common}} and known in veterinary practice, whereas the respiratory C. aerophila and C. boehmi have been rarely reported in pets as a likely consequence of overlapping morphometric and morphological features of the eggs, which impair a correct etiological diagnosis. FINDINGS: In December 2011, a mixed infestation by T. vulpis, C. aerophila and C. boehmi was diagnosed in an asymptomatic dog living in central Italy. Morphometric and morphological findings and pictures of the eggs found at the copromicroscopic analysis are herein reported. CONCLUSIONS: The present work demonstrates that when trichuroid eggs are found in a faecal sample from a dog, a careful morphological and morphometric analysis of individual parasite elements is mandatory. Key diagnostic features (i. e., size, wall surface pattern and aspects of plugs) should be carefully examined when eggs with overlapping shape and appearance are detected. In conclusion, given the importance in clinical practice of canine trichuroids and the zoonotic potential of C. aerophila, these nematodes should be included into the differential diagnosis of intestinal and respiratory parasitoses of dogs by a thorough microscopic analysis of all trichuroid ova present in microscopic fields...|$|R

25|$|Historically, the Greyhound has, {{since its}} first {{appearance}} as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree {{of fame and}} definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the <b>canine</b> <b>world.</b> In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009–2010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.|$|R

The Philippines continues to report several hundred cases of human rabies every year, and many more cases go undetected. In recent years, the province of Bohol has been targeted by the Philippine government and the World Health Organization for a rabies eradication program. ^ The primary objective of this dissertation research was to describe factors associated with dog vaccination coverage and knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding rabies among households in Bohol, Philippines. Utilizing a cross-sectional cluster survey design, we sampled 460 households and 541 dogs residing within dog-owning households. ^ Multivariate linear regression was used to examine potential associations between knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) and variables of interest. Forty-six percent of households knew that rabies was spread through the bite of an infected dog. The mean knowledge score was 8. 36 (SD: ± 3. 4; range: 1 – 24). We found that having known someone with rabies was significantly associated with an almost one point increase in the knowledge score (β = 0. 88; p = 0. 02).

At a personal level, dogs have been integral to our lives, and our parents’ lives, {{for as long}} as the two of us can remember.

2500|$|The Komondor's coat is long, thick, and strikingly corded white coat, about 20 – 27cm long (the {{heaviest}} {{amount of}} fur in the <b>canine</b> <b>world),</b> which resembles dreadlocks or a mop. The puppy coat {{is soft and}} fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer coat combining to form tassels, or cords and will take around two years to form. Some help is needed in separating the cords so the dog does not turn into one large matted mess. The length of the cords increases with time as the coat grows. Moulting is minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might think (once cords are fully formed). The only substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks fully form. The Komondor is born with only a white coat, unlike the similar-looking Puli, which can be white, black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements, and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally the coat protected the Komondor from wolves' bites, as the bites {{were not able to}} penetrate the thick coat. [...] The coat of the Komondor takes {{about two and a half}} days to dry after a bath.|$|R
