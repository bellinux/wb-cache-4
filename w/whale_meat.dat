5|$|In November 2008, the New Scientist {{reported}} {{in an article}} that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by Faroese government that the consumption of Pilot <b>Whale</b> <b>meat</b> in the Faroes should stop {{as it had been}} proved to be too toxic. However, the Faroese government did not forbid people to eat Pilot <b>Whale</b> <b>meat</b> due to the contamination, but the advice from the Joensen and Weihe had an effect, it has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.|$|E
5|$|The DNA {{profile of}} a {{sampling}} of <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> in the Japanese market found evidence of blue/fin hybrids.|$|E
2500|$|... 2011 – Japan [...] a young {{right whale}} {{was killed by}} being {{entangled}} in net in Oita Prefecture. This death was reported by a biologist who saw a right <b>whale's</b> <b>meat</b> being sold at a local market, later reported to a local aquarium.|$|R
25|$|A young Right Whale {{was killed}} when it {{entangled}} itself in a net off Oita Prefecture in March 2011. In fact, this was reported by a biologist who saw a right <b>whale's</b> <b>meat</b> being sold at a local market, later reported to a local aquarium.|$|R
50|$|Most {{nutrition}} {{from the}} <b>whale's</b> <b>meat</b> and organs. According to the Iñupiat people, the whales maktak, the thick black skin and attached oily blubber, contains body-warming energy and vitamin C. The whale's bones {{are used to}} frame sod iglus (igloo), and the elastic baleen is woven into baskets. The liver membrane is used for drums.|$|R
5|$|Women {{who plan}} to get {{pregnant}} within 3 months, pregnant women and women who breastfeed should probably not eat <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, Iceland's {{fisheries}} ministry {{authorized the}} hunting of 9 fin whales through August 2007. In 2009 and 2010, Iceland caught 125 and 148 fin whales, respectively. An Icelandic company, Hvalur, caught {{over a hundred}} fin whales in 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has caught more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> to Japan.|$|E
50|$|The cuisine of the Mariana Islands {{is largely}} {{made up of}} meat dishes {{including}} pork, poultry, horse meat, and meat from other land mammals. Some popular land mammals consumed include bats, mice, rate and lizards. Most of the dishes on the islands are cooked in coconut oil. Naturally, the islands' surrounding waters make seafood another popular option. Some seafoods include sea cucumbers, <b>whale's</b> <b>meat,</b> and various fish. It is said that the Mariana Island's cuisine is heavily influenced by its neighbors Papuan, Hawaiian, and American cuisines.|$|R
5000|$|The prized tail meat, called [...] or [...] are two {{strips of}} muscle that {{run from the}} dorsal {{to the base of}} the fluke. The tail meat is {{regarded}} as marbled, and is eaten as sashimi or tataki. Even Masanori Hata (aka Mutsugorō) a zoologist author and animal shelter operator has extolled the delicacy of the tail meat. It can only be derived from larger baleen whales, and the fin <b>whale's</b> <b>meat</b> has been considered superior. When the ban on this species was in place and Japan supposedly complied, what was claimed to be genuine fin whale was still available, and legitimized as [...] "grandfathered" [...] goods, i.e., frozen stock from animals caught when still legal. In the past when blue whale hunting was still conducted by all nations, its tail fin was served in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Cuisine of Commander Islands (Russian: Командорская кухня) is {{a mixture}} of {{traditional}} Russian cuisine and cuisine of Aleut people, who inhabit the Commander Islands. Commander cuisine is largely based on fish meat, seafood, mushrooms, meat of sea mammals (seals, <b>whales),</b> game <b>meat</b> and vegetable (potato, onion, garlic, carrot) which was brought to the Commander island by Russians.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of methylmercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E
25|$|Minke <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> {{is sold in}} {{restaurants}} and markets within Iceland. A {{large percentage of the}} <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> is actually eaten by tourists.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, {{environmental}} organizations accused Iceland of illegally exporting <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> to Denmark and Latvia. The Icelandic government later stated several shipments of fish meat were incorrectly labeled as <b>whale</b> <b>meat.</b> Then in April, 15 Greenpeace activists chained {{themselves to the}} mooring lines of the container ship NYK Orion in Rotterdam. The action was undertaken to stop a shipment of endangered fin <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> from Iceland, destined for Japan. The activists unchained themselves after the meat was voluntarily unloaded by the shipping company. Hvalur shipped more than 600tons of Fin <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> to Japan in the first 9months of 2010.|$|E
50|$|Another common dish is saury. Saury {{is a type}} of fish {{commonly}} used as Sashimi in this region. <b>Whale</b> and dolphin <b>meat</b> caught in Taiji-cho (13 mi away), is also eaten by a small few.|$|R
25|$|Once ashore, {{the whale}} was quickly flensed and divided into its {{separate}} parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for <b>whales</b> was <b>meat,</b> the entire <b>whale</b> {{was used in}} a variety of products including lamp oil, soaps, fertilizer, folding fans (baleen), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales a valuable resource and did not over-exploit local stocks.|$|R
50|$|Reports of the Daily Board (Diários de Bordo) of {{the ships}} note many unique experiences. Also found were a rich flora and fauna. Contact was made near the bay of St. Helena with tribes who ate sea lions, <b>whales,</b> gazelle <b>meat</b> and herbal roots; They walked covered with fur and their weapons were simple wooden spears of Zambujo and animal horns; They saw tribes who played rustic flutes in a coordinated manner, which was a {{surprising}} sight for the Europeans. Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) affected the crew. They crossed into Mozambique with palm trees yielding coconuts.|$|R
25|$|The post-war {{recovery}} established <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> as {{a nationwide}} food {{source for the}} first time. In 1947 <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> made up over 50 percent of the meat consumed in Japan. The market significantly increased through commercial sale and public distribution. In 1954, the School Lunch Act also included <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> in compulsory education (elementary and middle school) to improve the nutrition of Japanese children.|$|E
25|$|The pilot <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> and blubber are stored, prepared, {{and eaten}} in Faroese households. This {{also means that}} <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> is not {{available}} at supermarkets. Although the Faroe Islands’ main export is fish, {{this does not include}} pilot <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> or blubber. An annual catch of 956 pilot whales (1990–1999) is roughly equivalent to 500 tonnes of meat and blubber, some 30% of all meat produced locally in the Faroe Islands.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{should only}} eat one dinner with pilot <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> and blubber per month.|$|E
50|$|Seafood was an {{important}} part of the diet, in some places even more so than <b>meat.</b> <b>Whales</b> and walrus were hunted for food in Norway and the north-western parts of the North Atlantic region, and seals were hunted nearly everywhere. Oysters, mussels and shrimps were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish. In the southern regions, herring was also important.|$|R
50|$|Whaling is {{a method}} of hunting <b>whales</b> for their <b>meat,</b> oil and blubber. The hunting of whales on an {{industrial}} scale began in the 17th century and into the 20th century, {{and as a result}} of the quantities caught the whale is an endangered species. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986 to increase the remaining whale population in the seas.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{compliance}} with fisheries regulations regarding species caught {{and amount of}} the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen <b>whales</b> (<b>whale</b> oil, <b>meat)</b> were combined into a single commodity {{by the time the}} whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port.|$|R
25|$|Due to its low food {{self-sufficiency}} rate, around 40%, Japan relies on stockpiling {{to secure a}} stable food supply. As of 2009, Japan's 1.2 million ton seafood stockpile included nearly 5000 tons of <b>whale</b> <b>meat.</b> Japan has started to serve <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> in school lunches {{as part of a}} government initiative to reduce the amounts. However, there has been criticism of serving <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> to school children due to allegations of toxic methylmercury levels. The World Wildlife Fund has also estimated that the Japanese government has had to invest $12 million into the 2008–09 Antarctic whale hunt alone just to break even, and that subsidies in total have amounted to about $150 million since 1988.|$|E
25|$|Women {{who plan}} to get {{pregnant}} within 3 months, pregnant women and women who breastfeed should probably not eat <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> at all.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{acceptance}} of its proposals and {{under pressure from the}} United States, Iceland reduced the proposed <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> exports from 95% to 49% of the total catch and the requested quota from 200 to 120 whales. Despite a domestic campaign to encourage Icelanders to consume more <b>whale</b> <b>meat,</b> most of the supply was used as feed on fur farms or spoiled in warehouses. In an open letter to the government, Icelandic biologists condemned the program.|$|E
50|$|The {{stated purpose}} of the {{research}} program is to establish the size and dynamics of whale populations. The Japanese government wishes to resume whaling in a sustainable manner under the oversight of the IWC, both for <b>whale</b> products (<b>meat,</b> etc.) and to help preserve fishing resources by culling whales. Anti-whaling organizations claim that the research program is a front for commercial whaling, that the sample size is needlessly large and that equivalent information {{can be obtained by}} non-lethal means, for example by studying samples of whale tissue (such as skin) or feces. The Japanese government sponsored Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR), which conducts the research, disagrees, stating that the information obtainable from tissue and/or feces samples is insufficient and that the sample size is necessary in order to be representative.|$|R
50|$|Since 2000, {{researchers}} such as Tetsuya Endo, {{a professor}} at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, have found high concentrations of mercury in the <b>whale</b> and dolphin <b>meat</b> sold around Japan. In their studies, Taiji residents who eat dolphin meat had high levels of mercury in their hair. The Japanese Ministry of Health issued warnings on the consumption of some species of fish, whale, and dolphin since 2003. It recommended that children and pregnant women avoid eating them on a regular basis.|$|R
50|$|The term {{mother ship}} {{dates back to}} the 19th-century whaling trade when small, fast ships were used to chase and kill <b>whales.</b> The dead <b>meat</b> from several boats was then brought back to the larger, slower ship for {{processing}} and storage until the return to land. This model enabled a far more efficient method of whaling. Though whaling is much lower-scale than in earlier days, the single large storage ship model is still used extensively by fishermen. Such ships are known today as factory ships.|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} {{was an attempt}} by animal-rights activists to disrupt Iceland's whaling industry after the country circumvented a commercial ban on the practice to conduct research. No one was injured but the attack caused $2million worth of damage to the ships, $2 million worth of damage to the processing plant, and damage to the <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> freezer in the processing plant spoiled $4 million worth of <b>whale</b> <b>meat.</b> The perpetrators, Rod Coronado and David Howitt, were able to escape the scene via a flight to Luxembourg.|$|E
25|$|Julie Dreyfus, French actress, also {{fluent in}} Japanese and English. Notably refused to eat one dish {{prepared}} by Toshiro Kandagawa because it contained <b>whale</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} trade of <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> is prohibited by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty {{in order to}} remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> remained in cold storage in Japan. In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of <b>whale</b> <b>meat</b> the Japanese market could absorb. In negotiations with Marc Wall, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal to suggest to Iceland {{to reduce the number of}} killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.|$|E
25|$|Dolphin meat is {{dense and}} such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat {{is located in a}} layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either {{horseradish}} or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of <b>whale</b> or horse <b>meat</b> (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.|$|R
40|$|Eating whale-meat {{is part of}} Japanese culture, but the {{opportunities}} for doing so have become rare since a moratorium on commercial whaling was adopted at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1982. A survey of 274 undergraduate students (105 male and 169 female) born in or after 1982, was conducted in order to investigate their experience of eating whale-meat and their impressions of it. About 60 percent of those questioned had eaten whale-meat, and the males showed a higher preference for it than the females. The most popular whale-dishes were whale- meat marinated in soy sauce, deep-fried (tatsuta-age), boiled <b>whale</b> breast <b>meat</b> (kujira be-kon), raw (sashimi) and whale-cutlets (also deep-fried). Among the students who had eaten whale-meat, about 70 percent had done so at home, and 30 percent in school lunches. Among the impressions expressed were: “Whales are enormous mammals {{that live in the}} sea”; “Whale-meat used to be very cheap and was served in school lunches, but it is expensive and very rare now. ” The students who came from Yamaguchi Prefecture had more experience of eating whale-meat than the others...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of <b>whale</b> and dolphin <b>meat</b> is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|R
