5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties.

The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic Malays <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are {{an ethnic group}} of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts of Thailand, {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are {{unusual in}} {{that they have an}} acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} {{of a few}} radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues <b>which</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
