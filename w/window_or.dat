5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a <b>window</b> <b>or</b> aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger {{is no more than}} one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343, and was completed by 1358, and would have served both the original manor which now no longer survives and later {{the existing}} house. It has a small <b>window,</b> <b>or</b> squint, that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house.|$|E

5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab <b>window</b> (<b>or</b> slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be the {{daughter}} of an unspecified noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable Manchester Square. In some reports she was described as the daughter of a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a <b>window,</b> <b>or</b> a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a <b>window</b> <b>or</b> fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 slots and loaded from either the main menu or during play.|$|E

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's <b>window,</b> <b>or</b> even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
