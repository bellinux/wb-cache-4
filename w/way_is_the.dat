5|$|In {{the center}} of the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. Pinwheel tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, {{but this is not}} so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{of finding}} a pointed pseudotriangulation is to shell a point set; that is, to remove convex hull {{vertices}} one by one until all points have been removed. The family of sequences of removals that can be formed in this <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> shelling antimatroid of the point set, and the set of edges of convex hulls of the sequence of point sets formed by this removal process forms a pseudotriangulation. However, not all pointed pseudotriangulations can be formed in this way.|$|E

25|$|The second <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{addition}} of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at CpG sites, to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. 5-Methylcytosine performs {{much like a}} regular cytosine, pairing with a guanine in double-stranded DNA. However, {{some areas of the}} genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other (genetic imprinting).|$|E

Tracks where electric trains or electric trams run are equipped with an electrification system such as an overhead electrical power line or an additional electrified rail.|$|E

However, the way of the Abhidharma, and hence the way of enlightened persons like the Buddha, who have developed the true insight (vipassana), sees reality as the constant stream of collections of dharmas, and this way of seeing the world is ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya).|$|E
25|$|The H3 Monks <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most northerly of {{the major}} H roads. Whilst being a dual {{carriageway}} {{for most of its}} length, it starts its route in the west of the town at a double roundabout with V4 Watling Street before running as a single carriageway up until a junction with the A5 and the V5 Great Monks Street at Abbey Hill. From this point, it becomes a dual carriageway and is co-designated as the A422. It continues east across the town, crosses over the M1, until it ends in a roundabout with the A509 road south of Newport Pagnell. The Concrete Cows are the best known landmark on this road.|$|E

Similarly, almost all level crossings have been replaced by underpasses and overpasses in the city, with plans to replace all of them in the near future. One of the most major projects under <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> electrification of the remaining segments of the Roca Line – the most widely used in the network – and also moving the entire section of the Sarmiento Line which runs through the centre of the city underground to allow for better frequencies on the line and reduce congestion above ground.|$|E

25|$|Zephyrettes {{played a}} variety of {{different}} roles, from hostess and tour guide to first aid responder and babysitter, giving attention to all passengers, often with an emphasis on the handicapped, elderly, and children. Sometimes what was required of them was as simple as providing directions; Smith joked that if she had written a memoir about her experiences as a Zephyrette, she would have entitled it Which <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Diner?, noting that was a frequent question even in the Dome-Observation car (the last car on the train). Other times it was much more difficult; in 1955, Zephyrette Helen Schwartz, with the assistance of porter Roosevelt Williams and two female passengers, successfully delivered a baby on the train outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. That child, Peter Zars, would return to the California Zephyr to celebrate his seventh birthday, again with the assistance of a Zephyrette. Due to the train's prestige, famous passengers were quite common, and Zephyrettes interacted with them directly, from Bernard Baruch and Pierre Monteux to Mamie Eisenhower and professional baseball players.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for two or more {{separate}} open clusters to form {{out of the same}} molecular cloud. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 are forming from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while in our own galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born at the same time will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (sometimes mistakenly called h and χ Persei; h refers to a neighboring star and χ to both clusters), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. Many more are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in external systems than in our own galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.|$|E

500|$|The Milky <b>Way</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> galaxy that {{contains}} our Solar System.

The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin , from the Greek [...] ( [...] , [...] "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way {{is just one of many}} galaxies.|$|E
