5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board <b>was</b> <b>exposed</b> from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes.

40|$|Iron-based {{amorphous}} alloys can be {{more resistant}} to corrosion than polycrystalline materials of similar compositions. However, when the amorphous alloys <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to high temperatures they may recrystallize (or devitrify) thus losing their resistance to corrosion. Four different types of amorphous alloys melt spun ribbon specimens <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to several temperatures for short periods of time. The resulting corrosion resistance was evaluated in seawater at 90 C and compared with the as-prepared ribbons. Results show that the amorphous alloys can <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> to 600 C for 1 -hr. without losing the corrosion resistance; however, when the ribbons <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> at 800 C for 1 -hr. their localized corrosion resistance decreased significantly...|$|R
