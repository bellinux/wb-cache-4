500|$|Apple Records {{released}} Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973. [...] "Be Here Now" [...] {{appeared as}} the second track on side two of the original LP format, following what Rodriguez describes as the [...] "funky uptempo" [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)". It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little man in my head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> the damned thing off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E
500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing.

In 2015, it won the Best Mixed Album award at the Indian Recording Arts (IRA) in India and Lux Style Award for Best Album in Pakistan. The album spawned a single “Phir Mili Tanhai”. Zoe told in interview that “Phir Mili Tanhai” {{was one of}} the very first songs she wrote and was inspired by her real relationship. [...] "Phir Mili Tanhai {{was one of the}} very first songs I wrote. In fact it’s a marker of the period <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> to songwriting in the first place.
