A Mr Poulton oversaw the fitting of the library and a Captain Banister acted as clerk of works. The site had been donated by the squire, John Talbot Clifton of Lytham Hall.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, {{while still}} heavily engaged with the Telemobiloscope, Hülsmeyer filed {{for a patent}} (DE180009) on a machine for {{diameter}} reduction of metallic rods and tubes, and in 1906, established a firm supplying equipment for producing incandescent lamps. This was followed in 1907 by his forming the company Kessel-und Apparatebau Christian Hülsmeyer (Boilers and Apparatus Construction) in Düsseldorf; in 1910, he bought a factory site at Düsseldorf-Flingern for the firm. For many years, this company built steam and <b>water</b> <b>apparatus,</b> high-pressure gauges, and anti-rust-filters (trade named “Rostex”). The company continued to operate until 1953. Altogether in his career, Hülsmeyer developed and patented some 180 inventions; these and his various businesses ultimately brought him financial success.|$|E

Adjoining the College is the Governor’s house. Apartments are arranged for the sick and for the repairing of clothes. A spacious kitchen court contains the laundry, wash-house and engine house, and a large drying-ground and covered playground are provided.

40|$|The trials {{reported}} in this report were instigated by the Bureau of Aeronautics of the Navy Department {{for the purpose of}} determining accurately the speed and resistance of the U. S. S. "Los Angeles" with and without <b>water</b> recovery <b>apparatus,</b> and to clear up the apparent discrepancies between the speed attained in service and in the original trials in Germany. The trials proved very conclusively that the <b>water</b> recovery <b>apparatus</b> increases the resistance about 20 per cent, which is serious, and shows the importance of developing a type of recovery having less resistance. Between the American and the German speed trials without water recovery there remains an unexplained discrepancy of nearly 6 per cent in speed at a given rate of engine revolutions. Warping of the propeller blades and small cumulative errors of observation seem the most probable causes of the discrepancy. It was found that the customary resistance coefficients C, are 0. 0242 and 0. 0293 without and with the <b>water</b> recovery <b>apparatus,</b> respectively. The corresponding values of the propulsive coefficient K, are 56. 7 and 44. 6. If there is an error in these figures, it is probably in a slight overestimate of C, and an underestimate of K. The maximum errors are almost certainly less than 5 per cent. No scale effect was detected indicating variation of C with respect to velocity (author) ...|$|R
