These were largely based on their gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, re-designed heads, fast glow plugs, and on the 5.7L, oversized cranks, main bearings, and wrist pins. There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> in the fuel line), paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather, reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys, head bolt failures, {{and the use of}} aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. [...] 4.3L V6 diesels were also offered between 1982 and 1985.|$|E

50|$|The air is {{then sent}} through a <b>water</b> <b>separator,</b> {{where the air}} is forced to spiral along its length and {{centrifugal}} forces cause the moisture to be flung through a sieve and toward the outer walls where it is channeled toward a drain and sent overboard. Then, the air usually will pass through a <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> coalescer or the sock. The sock retains the dirt and oil from the engine bleed air to keep the cabin air cleaner. This water removal process prevents ice from forming and clogging the system, and keeps the cockpit and cabin from fogging on ground operation and low altitudes.|$|E

50|$|In a {{centrifugal}} oil and <b>water</b> <b>separator,</b> {{the force}} of gravity is one-thousand times greater that of the coalescing plate pack separator or the petrol interceptor, so the separation is much greater.

50|$|Centrifugal oil and <b>water</b> <b>separators</b> do {{have their}} {{disadvantage}}s. One known disadvantage of these separators {{is that they}} tend to have low powered suction. For example, when the pump end is dry and the impeller is rotating at high speeds, it is simply not powerful enough to lift the oily water mixture into the separator. For this reason, these separators must always be primed before use.|$|R

5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and <b>water</b> <b>separators</b> designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|R
40|$|Bilge water accumulates in {{recesses}} and bilges onboard ships. Depending on {{the type}} of design and age, ships can generate large volumes of bilge water. This wastewater is a mixture of fresh water and seawater containing various contaminants. Typical contaminants may include fuels, oils, greases, detergents, solvents, rusts, paints, insulation material and a wide variety of other substances. Bilge water is a very challenging wastewater to treat due to large variations in production rates and the complex nature of the wastes in solution. Membrane based Oily <b>Water</b> <b>Separators</b> (OWS) are being increasingly used throughout the world for the treatment of oily wastewater. This work focused on two areas of study: (1) Effects of selected components found in bilge water on membrane performance, and (2) Pilot scale testing using a Microfiltration/Ultrafiltration (MF/UF) hybrid system. The studies are aimed at determining suitable membrane materials and optimum operating conditions such as trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and backflushing for permeate flux enhancement.

50|$|Beware {{that water}} {{need not be}} separated, causing the need to add {{chemicals}} so that the crude and water emulsifies. This process is then reversed at storage by adding demulsifiers that makes the water fall out, and can be tapped {{from the bottom of}} the tank.

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} at typical jetliner cruising altitudes is generally very dry and cold; the outside air {{pumped into the}} cabin on a long flight {{has the potential to}} cause condensation which might in turn cause corrosion or electrical faults, and is thus eliminated.

This dynamic approach expands the problem to include the production strategy, which complicates the problem. Through a case study the value of the new dynamic approach is proven to be considerably higher than the currently used approach. This might defend the increased computational costs needed to solve the problem. </p...|$|R

Current methods use solvent extraction and IR analysis of water samples. In this paper we present an alternative method, which does not use any solvents and can provide in-situ analysis of the hydrocarbon concentration in water. This method is based on FCI Environmental Inc. 's fiber optic chemical sensor (FOCS) technology. It provides accurate and reliable data to improve overall water processing on platforms. The instruments have been extensively tested by a number of companies on their platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea.

50|$|Once {{this water}} is again inside the boiler or steam generator, {{the process of}} adding the latent heat of {{vaporization}} or Enthalpy is underway. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel. The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down the downcomers to the lower inlet waterwall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the waterwalls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located {{on the front and}} rear waterwalls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the waterwalls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of steam and <b>water</b> <b>separators</b> and then dryers inside the steam drum. The steam separators and dryers remove the water droplets from the steam and the cycle through the waterwalls is repeated. This process is known as natural circulation.|$|R

The bilge water from the oily <b>water</b> <b>separator</b> is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter.

If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time.
