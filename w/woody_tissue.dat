5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and <b>woody</b> <b>tissue.</b> Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E

Imprints of organisms made {{while they were still}} alive are called trace fossils, examples of which are burrows, footprints, etc.|$|E
500|$|A tree {{typically}} {{has many}} secondary branches supported {{clear of the}} ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials {{from one part of}} the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.|$|E

500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is a saprotrophic species, {{deriving}} {{nutrients from}} dead and decomposing organic matter, and grows {{in and around}} stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on bark, particularly the secondary phloem, rather than the wood. In the scheme of the succession of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, C.micaceus is a late stage colonizer, and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached [...] "a friable softened consistency". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an endophyte, inhabiting the <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; {{it has also been}} noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120m (400ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.|$|E
500|$|In plant {{physiology}} research interest {{was focused on}} the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. Jan Helmont (1577–1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake. Englishman Stephen Hales (1677–1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished [...] "root pressure", [...] "leaf suction" [...] and [...] "imbibition" [...] and also noted that the major direction of sap flow in <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> is upward. His results were published in Vegetable Staticks (1727) He also noted that [...] "air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables". English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later Jan Ingenhousz (1730–1799) observed that only in sunlight do the green parts of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO2) is released from all parts. His results were published in Experiments upon vegetables (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved. Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's (1767–1845) [...] was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth.|$|E
2500|$|Aquatic {{plants are}} more buoyant than their {{terrestrial}} counterparts because freshwater {{has a higher}} density than air. [...] This makes structural rigidity unimportant in lakes and ponds [...] (except in the aerial stems and leaves). [...] Thus, the leaves and stems of most aquatic plants use less energy to construct and maintain <b>woody</b> <b>tissue,</b> investing that energy into fast growth instead. In order to contend with stresses induced by wind and waves, plants must be both flexible and tough. [...] Light, water depth and substrate types {{are the most important}} factors controlling the distribution of submerged aquatic plants. [...] Macrophytes are sources of food, oxygen, and habitat structure in the benthic zone, but cannot penetrate the depths of the euphotic zone and hence are not found there.|$|E
50|$|Necroses {{are caused}} due to {{necrosis}} or death of plant cells. The affected plant tissue usually turns brown to black in color. Necrotic symptoms could appear in {{any part of}} the plant such as in storage organs, in green <b>tissues,</b> or in <b>woody</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
40|$|Wood {{is formed}} by the {{successive}} addition of secondary xylem, which consists of cells with a conspicuously thickened secondary wall composed mainly of lignin and cellulose. Several genes involved in lignin and cellulose biosynthesis have been characterized, but the factors that regulate the formation of secondary walls in <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> remain to be identified. In this study, we show that plant-specific transcription factors, designated NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 (NST 1) and NST 3, are key regulators {{of the formation of}} secondary walls in <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana. In nst 1 - 1 nst 3 - 1 double knockout plants, the secondary wall thickenings in interfascicular fibers and secondary xylem, except for vascular vessels, were completely suppressed without affecting formation of cells destined to be <b>woody</b> <b>tissues.</b> Conversely, as shown previously for NST 1, overexpression of NST 3 induced ectopic secondary wall thickenings in various aboveground tissues. Furthermore, the expression of chimeric repressors derived from NST 1 and NST 3 suppressed secondary wall thickenings in the presumptive interfascicular fibers. Because putative orthologs of NST 1 and NST 3 are present in the genome of poplar, our results suggest that they are also key regulators of the formation of secondary walls in woody plants and could b...|$|R

60|$|Every leaf {{during its}} {{vitality}} secreting carbon from the atmosphere, with {{the elements of}} water, formed a certain quantity of <b>woody</b> <b>tissue,</b> which extended down {{the outside of the}} tree to the ground, and farther to the extremities of the roots.

6000|$|The rocking of {{the stem}} of a tree {{increases}} in a marked manner {{the growth of the}} <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> in the parts which are strained. Prof. Sachs believes, from reasons which he assigns, that {{this is due to the}} pressure of the bark being relaxed in such parts, and not as Knight and H. Spencer maintain, to an increased flow of sap caused by the movement of the trunk. (24/16. Ibid volume 2 page 269. Sachs 'Text-book of Botany' 1875 page 734.) But hard <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> may be developed without the aid of any movement, as we see with ivy closely attached to an old wall. In all such cases, it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects of long-continued selection and those which follow from the increased action of the part, or directly from some other cause. Mr. H. Spencer (24/17. Ibid volume 2 page 273.) acknowledges this difficulty, and gives as an instance the thorns on trees and the shells of nuts. Here we have extremely hard <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> without the possibility of any movement, and without, as far as we can see, any other directly exciting cause; and as the hardness of these parts is of manifest service to the plant, we may look at the result as probably due to the selection of so-called spontaneous variations. Every one knows that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands; and when we hear that with infants, long before birth, the epidermis is thicker on the palms and soles of the feet than on any other part of the body, as was observed with admiration by Albinus (24/18. Paget 'Lectures on Pathology' volume 2 page 209.), we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of long-continued use or pressure. We are tempted to extend the same view even to the hoofs of quadrupeds; but who will pretend to determine how far natural selection may have aided in the formation of structures of such obvious importance to the animal? ...|$|E

40|$|Key message: Once {{the effect}} of stand age has been taken into account, {{nutrient}} availability and climate {{play a crucial role}} in determining the B:NPPs of <b>woody</b> and non-woody <b>tissues.</b> - Abstract: Forest ecosystems accumulate large amounts of carbon in living tissues. The residence time of this carbon in the ecosystem depends largely on the turnover time of these tissues, which can be estimated as a surrogate of the ratio of biomass to net primary production (B:NPP). We used a global forest database of 310 sites containing data for biomass stocks and NPP to investigate the differences of B:NPPs among species and forest compartments and to determine B:NPPs main exogenous (mainly climate and nutrient availability) and endogenous (leaf habit and stand age) drivers. We used asymptotic exponential functions to adjust the B:NPPs of woody compartments to a theoretical stationary state to allow comparisons between forests of different ages. The B:NPPs of <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> (branches, stems, and coarse roots) were positively influenced by stand age, conversely to fine roots and leaves, which were weakly dependent on the age of the forest. The B:NPPs of <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> were positively correlated with nutrient availability, whereas fine-root B:NPPs decreased with increasing nutrient availability. The foliar B:NPP of evergreen forests was positively correlated with water deficit, and the fine-root B:NPP was correlated positively with the seasonality of precipitation and with annual thermal amplitude but negatively with water deficit. Our results support the influence of climate on the B:NPPs of non-woody compartments and identify nutrient availability as the main influence on the B:NPPs of <b>woody</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

60|$|Plants {{no doubt}} preceded animal forms in this {{invasion}} of the land, but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration {23} very closely. The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of getting water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant, {{now that it was}} no longer close at hand. The two problems were solved by the development of <b>woody</b> <b>tissue</b> which both sustained the plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves. The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like.

6000|$|The {{flexible}} petiole {{of a half}} or {{a quarter}} grown leaf which has clasped an object {{for three or four}} days increases much in thickness, and after several weeks becomes so wonderfully hard and rigid that it can hardly be removed from its support. On comparing a thin transverse slice of such a petiole with one from an older leaf growing close beneath, which had not clasped anything, its diameter was found to be fully doubled, and its structure greatly changed. In two other petioles similarly compared, and here represented, the increase in diameter was not quite so great. In the section of the petiole in its ordinary state (A), we see a semilunar band of cellular tissue (not well shown in the woodcut) differing slightly in appearance from that outside it, and including three closely approximate groups of dark vessels. Near the upper surface of the petiole, beneath two exterior ridges, there are two other small circular groups of vessels. In the section of the petiole (B) which had clasped during several weeks a stick, the two exterior ridges have become much less prominent, and the two groups of woody vessels beneath them much increased in diameter. The semilunar band has been converted into a complete ring of very hard, white, <b>woody</b> <b>tissue,</b> with lines radiating from the centre. The three groups of vessels, which, though near together, were before distinct, are now completely blended. The upper part of this ring of woody vessels, formed by the prolongation of the horns of the original semilunar band, is narrower than the lower part, and slightly less compact. This petiole after clasping the stick had actually become thicker than the stem from which it arose; and this was chiefly due to the increased thickness of the ring of wood. This ring presented, both in a transverse and longitudinal section, a closely similar structure to that of the stem. It is a singular morphological fact that the petiole should thus acquire a structure almost identically the same with that of the axis; and it is a still more singular physiological fact that so great a change should have been induced by the mere act of clasping a support. {23} ...|$|E

40|$|Drought regimes can be {{characterized}} by the variability in the quantity of rainfall and the duration of rainless periods. However, most research on plant response to drought has ignored the impacts of rainfall variation, {{especially with regard to}} the influence of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in promoting drought resistance.

NSC concentrations decreased in <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> under infrequent-high watering but increased under no watering. A faster decline of growth relative to stomatal conductance in the no watering treatment was consistent with NSC accumulation {{as a result of an}} uncoupling of growth and photosynthesis, while usage of stored NSCs in <b>woody</b> <b>tissues</b> to maintain function may account for the NSC decline under infrequent-high watering. NSCs, and specifically stem NSCs, contributed to drought resistance under severe water deficits, while NSCs had a less clear role in drought resistance to variability in water availability.
