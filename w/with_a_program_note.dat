40|$|We study a single-machine {{sequencing}} {{problem with}} both release dates and deadlines {{to minimize the}} total weighted completion time. We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm for this problem. The algorithm exploits an effective lower bound and <b>a</b> dynamic <b>programming</b> dominance technique. <b>As</b> a byproduct of the lower bound, we have developed a new algorithm for the generalized isotonic regression problem; the algorithm {{can also be used}} as an O(n log n) -time timetabling routine in earliness–tardiness scheduling. Extensive computational experiments indicate that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm competes favorably <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dynamic <b>programming</b> procedure. <b>Note</b> to Practitioners—Real-life production systems usually involve multiple machines and resources. The configurations of such systems may be complex and subject to change over time. Therefore, model-based solution approaches, which aim to solve scheduling problems for specific configurations, will inevitably run into difficulties. By contrast, decomposition methods are much more expressive and extensible. The single-machine problem and its solution procedure studied in this paper will prove useful to a decomposition method that decomposes multiplemachine, multiple-resource scheduling problems into a number of single-machine problems. The total weighted completion time objective is relevant to production environments where inventory levels and manufacturing cycle times are key concerns. Future research can be pursued along two directions. First, it seems to be necessary to further generalize the problem to consider also negative job weights. Second, the solution procedure developed here is ready to be incorporated into a machine-oriented decomposition method such as the shifting bottleneck procedure...|$|R

40|$|In concerts {{of western}} {{classical}} music {{the provision of}} <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note</b> is <b>a</b> widespread practice {{dating back to the}} 18 th century and still commonly in use. <b>Program</b> <b>notes</b> tend to inform listeners and performers about historical context, composer biographical details and compositional thinking. However, the scant <b>program</b> <b>note</b> research conducted to date reveals that <b>program</b> <b>notes</b> may not foster understanding or enhance listener enjoyment as previously assumed. In the case of canonic works, performers and listeners may already be familiar with much of the <b>program</b> <b>note</b> information. This is not so in the case of newly composed works, which formed the basis of the exploratory study reported here. This article reports the views of 17 living contemporary composers on their writing of <b>program</b> <b>notes</b> for their own works. In particular the study sought to understand the intended recipient, intended role and the content of composer-written <b>program</b> <b>notes.</b> Participating cComposers identified three main roles for their program notes: to shape a performer’s interpretation of the work; to guide, engage or direct the listener and/or performer; and as collaborative mode of communication between the composer, performer and listener. For some composers this collaboration was intended to result in performative listening in which listeners were actively engaged in bringing each composition to life. This was also described as a form of empathy that results in the co-construction of the musical experience. Overall, composers avoided giving too much personal information and they provided performers with more structural information. However, composers did not agree on whether the same information should be provided to both performers and listeners. Composers’ responses problematize the view of <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note</b> as <b>a</b> simple statement from writer to recipient, indicating instead a more complex set of relations at play between composer, performer, listener and the work itself. These relations are illustrated in a proposed model. There are implications for <b>program</b> <b>note</b> writers and readers, and for educators. Future research might seek to enhance understanding of <b>program</b> <b>notes,</b> including whether the written <b>program</b> <b>note</b> is the most effective format for communications about music...|$|R
5000|$|Steve Smith of The New York Times highly lauded the piece, remarking: From {{a melancholy}} opening filled with {{swooping}} glissandos, the 20-minute string quartet emphasizes group virtuosity with jagged bursts of notes deployed in rhythmic unison, mostly at high velocity.

The Calder players met all of its challenges easily in an exacting account. Christian Hertzog of LA Weekly similarly declared the work to be [...] "the most exciting, take-no-prisoners quartet since George Crumb's Black Angels (1971), and it should become just as popular." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Henry Bellamann's <b>program</b> <b>note</b> to the 1927 {{premiere of}} the first and second {{movements}} of the symphony (<b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note</b> that seems to be ghost-written by Ives, as his tone of voice and use of language is obvious throughout), the program of the symphony is described this way: [...] "The aesthetic program of the work is that of many of the greatest literary and musical masterpieces of the world—the searching questions of What? and Why? which the spirit of man asks of life. This is particularly the sense of the prelude. The... succeeding movements are the diverse answers in which existence replies." [...] In his Memos, Ives misquotes Bellamann's <b>program</b> <b>note</b> by attributing to it the famous description of the Finale (hence providing further proof that he had supplied descriptive text to Bellamann for the note, with Bellamann dropping the Finale's description because of its absence on the 1927 performance): [...] "The last movement is an apotheosis of the preceding content, in terms that {{have something to do with}} the reality of existence and its religious experience." ...|$|R

Hanssen also reports {{that at this time}} he had lent Strindberg a book of mysteries by Edgar Allan Poe, and that Poe was a significant influence on Strindberg’s writing at this time. A possible example of that influence, is that a scene of psychological detective work occurs in Poe’s short story, [...] "The Gold Bug", that appears to have inspired an episode in Pariah. Strindberg's original title for the play is “Paria”, with its Hindu etymology. Some English translations use the title, “The Outcast”, which, however, can be confused <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earlier play by Strindberg, “The Outlaw”.|$|R

5000|$|Jay Nordlinger of The New Criterion was {{slightly}} {{more critical of}} the piece, however, remarking, [...] "I found Karawane a bit tiresome.

[...] Despite calling it [...] "entertaining and grandiose," [...] George Grella of the New York Classical Review similarly observed that the [...] "narrative feel of Karawane loses out to density over a 30-minute duration." [...] He added, [...] "There are entertaining, colorful bits of music that seem inspired by other composers, like Ennio Morricone, Philip Glass, and John Adams. In particular, sections seem like responses to Harmonium. Salonen embraces clichés <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knowing wink, but they add bigness to a piece that is already overblown." ...|$|R
