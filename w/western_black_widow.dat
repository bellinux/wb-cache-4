2500|$|Although the {{reputation}} of these spiders is notorious and their venom does affect humans, only mature females are capable of envenomation in humans; their chelicerae—the hollow, needle-like mouthparts that inject venom—are, at approximately 1mm., or [...]04 in., long enough to inject venom into humans, unlike those of the much smaller males. The actual amount injected, even by a mature female, is variable. The venom injected by the female black widow is known as alpha-latrotoxin which binds to receptors at the neuromuscular motor end plate of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, resulting in increased synaptic concentration of catecholamines. The symptoms are caused by lymphatic absorption and vascular dissemination of the neurotoxin. The symptoms that result from a black widow spider bite are collectively known as latrodectism. Deaths in healthy adults from Latrodectus bites are exceedingly rare, with no deaths despite two thousand bites yearly. On the other hand, the geographical range of the widow spiders is vast. Epidemics of mostly European Widow spider bites had been recorded from 1850 to 1950, {{and during that time}} period, deaths were reported from 2/1000 to 50/1000 bites.

50|$|Latrodectus variolus, the {{northern}} black widow spider or northern widow, is a medically important spider species of the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae.

The tensile strength for the three kinds of silk measured in the Blackledge study was about 1000 MPa. The ultimate strength reported in a previous study for Nephila edulis was 1290 ± 160 MPa. The tensile strength of spider silk is comparable to that of steel wire of the same thickness. However, as the density of steel is about six times that of silk, silk is correspondingly stronger than steel wire of the same weight.|$|E
50|$|Courtship {{displays}} in sexually cannibalistic spiders are imperative {{in order to}} ensure the female is less aggressive.

40|$|In spiders, pheromones mediate {{intersexual}} attraction, courtship behaviour, and mate recognition. I {{studied the}} chemical communication {{system of the}} <b>western</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider, Latrodectus hesperus. Females attract males to their webs with silk-borne sex pheromones. Contact with the silk elicits courtship behaviour by males. Often, the courting male engages in web reduction behaviour, during which he excises and bundles up sections of the web and wraps them with his own silk. Using analytical chemistry, and behavioural tests in both the laboratory and the field, I investigated (1) the molecular structure and function of the female’s contact sex pheromone, and (2) the function of web reduction behaviour. A silk-borne contact pheromone elicits web reduction behaviour, and a serine derivative similar to the pheromone of congeneric L. hasselti is one constituent of the multi-component pheromone. Web reduction decreases web attractiveness to rival males in the field, thereby limiting male-male competition...|$|E

40|$|Web-building spiders are {{territorial}} animals whose webs serve several purposes including foraging, repro-duction and protection. Two {{factors are}} predicted {{to be of}} primary importance in determining a spider’s web-building strategy: (1) current nutritional state (a function of prior feeding rate), which determines the net value of a web, and (2) the presence of co-occurring spiders with whom it may have to interact and partition resources. I conducted a laboratory experiment to test whether <b>western</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, express state-dependent web-building strategies that vary {{with the presence of}} conspe-cific or heterospecific (Tegenaria agrestis and T. duellica) spiders in a microhabitat. I maintained L. hesperus females on two different diets (high- versus low-food) and tested their web-building behaviour in the pres-ence or absence of neighbours. When sharing a microhabitat with con- or heterospecific spiders, L. hesperus increased their web-building investment by producing higher-density webs containingmore silk and by ini-tiating web-building sooner. Web building was further influenced by nutritional state, such that well-fed spiders produced more silk and built denser webs than their poorly fed counterparts. Furthermore, micro-habitat occupancy level and nutritional state showed a combined effect on the different components of web-building behaviour in L. hesperus. I discuss how this behavioural plasticity might optimize microhab-itat settlement investments in the context of constraints on web-building activities imposed by nutritional state and cohabitation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Capture silks are an {{interesting}} class of biological glues that help spiders subdue their prey. Viscid capture silk produced by the orb web spiders {{is a combination of}} hygroscopic salts that aid in water uptake and interact with adhesive glycoproteins to make them soft and sticky. The orb was a stepping stone to the evolution of new web types, but {{little is known about the}} adhesives in these webs. For instance, cobweb spiders evolved from orb-weaving ancestors and utilize glue in specialized sticky gumfoot threads rather than an elastic spiral. Early investigation suggests that gumfoot adhesives are quite different viscid glues because they lack a visible glycoprotein core, act as viscoelastic fluids rather than solids, and are largely invariant to humidity. Here, we use spectroscopic and staining methods to show that the gumfoot silk produced by Latrodectus hesperus (<b>western</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow)</b> is composed of hygroscopic organic salts and water insoluble glycoproteins, similar to viscid silk, in addition to a low concentration of spider coating peptides reported before. Our adhesion studies reveal that the organic salts play an important role in adhesion, similar to that seen in orb web spiders, but modulating function at much lower humidity. Our work shows more similarities in the viscid silk produced by orb web and cobweb spiders than previously anticipated and provid...|$|E
40|$|A {{major goal}} of {{evolutionary}} {{research is to}} elucidate the processes involved {{in the evolution of}} group versus solitary living, by examining the selective forces driving or constraining a particular type of social system. Species with intermediate group living tendencies are particularly interesting because they offer insight into evolutionary transitions and, in particular, how different selective environments may modulate group living behaviours. This dissertation explores the different factors that shape the social strategies of the <b>western</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider, Latrodectus hesperus, a facultatively group-living spider. Over a period of four years, I characterized the social structure of coastal British Columbia populations of L. hesperus, and show that individuals live either solitarily or in groups depending on the time of year, their reproductive status, and age. I then used an experimental approach to investigate the dynamics and adaptive value of facultative group-living behaviours, by testing different hypotheses about the decisions involved in social interactions, web building, microhabitat settlement, movement, and foraging. Several factors were manipulated and shown to influence the patterns of group living in L. hesperus, including individual nutritional state, prey availability, group size, population density, and neighbour proximity. Spiders adjusted their group living behaviours according to changes in these factors, and responded strategically to the presence and proximity of conspecifics. Based on the results of these experiments, I developed a model of group living in spiders that specifically considers the dynamic and strategic nature of social interactions in the context of frequency-dependent selection. The research presented in this thesis furthers our understanding of the evolution of social behaviour by providing new evidence on the mechanisms that promote and regulate facultative group-living behaviours...|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the <b>black</b> <b>widow,</b> than the <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than <b>black</b> <b>widows,</b> this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|R
