5|$|Changes {{were made}} for the third season, with the {{introduction}} of the season long Xindi storyline. This improved the reviews that the series was receiving, and the viewers in the 18 to 35 demographics but the overall ratings continued to decrease. UPN cut the 26 episode order for the third season to 24, meaning that if 24 episodes were created for the fourth season as <b>well</b> <b>then</b> they would have the 100 episodes needed for syndication. As well as a move to Friday nights, the fourth season was shortened further to 22 episodes, meaning that at cancellation there were 98 episodes produced in total. At the time of cancellation, Enterprise remained the highest rated drama series on UPN. The series went immediately into broadcast syndication; the arrangements having been made by UPN prior to the cancellation. It is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.|$|E

To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea.

25|$|The biggest two {{challenges}} for Munro to overcome while modifying his bike were {{his lack of}} money and that he worked full-time as a motorcycle salesman.

25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned.

One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E
25|$|In the film, where Harry and Hermione have {{travelled}} back in {{time and}} are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as <b>well,</b> <b>then</b> after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, right before he is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.|$|E
25|$|We must refuse {{everything}} to the Jews as a nation and accord {{everything to}} Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. <b>Well</b> <b>then!</b> If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E

25|$|Lt. Colonel Staquait (Jim Cummings) – A vicious, scar-faced Colonel in the French Foreign Legion. He {{sees himself}} {{on the right side}} of the law, but his {{draconian}} means do not justify his actions, putting him at odds with Tarzan. He acts as judge and executioner, and has made it his goal to hunt down Hugo and Hooft because they refused his order to burn down a village full of women and children. Tarzan helped fake their demise, but eventually the Colonel learned the truth and imprisoned them. Tarzan ended up imprisoned in Fort Doom as <b>well,</b> <b>then</b> after allowing Hugo and Hoof to escape, he was sentenced to be hanged, but was released after Renard impersonated a French magistrate, which Staquait doesn't notice as the heroes safely returned to Africa by steamship.|$|E
25|$|Bearers {{of names}} in the Hurrian {{language}} are attested in wide areas of Syria and the northern Levant that are clearly outside {{the area of the}} political entity known to Assyria as Hanilgalbat. There is no indication that these persons owed allegiance to the political entity of Mitanni; although the German term Auslandshurriter ("Hurrian expatriates") has been used by some authors. In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names. If this can be taken to mean that the population of these states was Hurrian as <b>well,</b> <b>then</b> it is possible that these entities were a part of a larger polity with a shared Hurrian identity. This is often assumed, but without a critical examination of the sources. Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.|$|E

Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at Harvard University. Burnett stayed with him until he was <b>well,</b> <b>then</b> {{returned to}} London. At this time she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write A Lady of Quality. A Lady of Quality, published in 1896, was to become {{the first of a series}} of successful adult historical novels, which was followed in 1899 with In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim; and in 1901 she had published The Making of a Marchioness and The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.|$|E

The ANZAC casualties were seventy-three dead, 243 wounded and six missing. Turkish casualties for this battle are not known, but altogether they had lost more than half of the 18,000 man force in their advance, into the Sinai. It was intended for the ANZAC Division to camp that night close by, with the intention of shadowing the Turkish force the next day, if they withdrew. However, Chauvel withdrew the division except for some observation posts left behind, all the way back to Oghratina. Reconnaissance patrols on the 10 August reported that the Turkish still occupied the area of the <b>well.</b> <b>Then</b> early the next day a New Zealand patrol reported the Turkish had evacuated the position and were at Salama. The remainder of the ANZAC Division advanced to contact with the Turkish force, but both sides only engaged in long range artillery and rifle fire. That night the Turkish force, broke off contact and retired to El Arish.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a dead stop as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a dead stop. Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake and turn around with the plane turning around as <b>well.</b> <b>Then</b> it was a race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full dead stop at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|E
500|$|Gordimer uses {{quotation}} dashes to punctuate her {{dialogue in}} Burger's Daughter instead of traditional quotation marks.

500|$|Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden commented in {{response}} to [...] "World of Stone" [...] and other songs that [...] "again plead plaintively with critics not to judge too severely": [...] "In this different context , such pleas are more sympathetic.

500|$|In the 1977 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler {{described}} Extra Texture as [...] "another lugubrious offering" [...] and concluded: [...] "the needle of the listener's personal Ecstatograph points sullenly towards zero throughout." [...] Harrison's pleas for tolerance and understanding, like his self-deprecation {{on the album}} sleeve, seemed to backfire. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden found that the album showed signs that Harrison was [...] "no longer so scornful of his audience" [...] compared with Dark Horse. Woffinden wrote of the songs that [...] "plead plaintively with critics not to judge too severely": [...] "In this different context, such pleas are more sympathetic. Very <b>well,</b> <b>then,</b> we will not. Extra Texture wasn't really very good musically... but it did have some appealing qualities, and barely any disagreeable ones." ...|$|E
500|$|He joined Conference Premier rivals Cambridge United on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} for a £15,000 fee on 6 August 2008. His debut {{came in a}} 1–0 win away to Northwich Victoria on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008. Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying [...] "It will put the added responsibility on me to start shooting and take some pressure off the forwards. If the midfield can get some goals as <b>well,</b> <b>then</b> {{that will help the}} team".
