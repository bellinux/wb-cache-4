Hawker arrives with Sheila in tow, having just come from a hunt, wanting to fill up his liquor flask. Sheila has heard {{from one of the}} house {{servants}} that Poirot visited her father the day before. He tells her of the threat she is under from her drug taking; as he leaves he hears Pam <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> Sheila about the flask. Poirot sees the abandoned flask and finds it full of white powder.|$|E
500|$|Gwyneth Herbert {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "sophisticated jazz-ballad artist" [...] with a [...] "precociously powerful chemistry of taste and meticulous care for every sound– from a <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> an exhortation" [...] and [...] "a voice that can effortlessly render any emotion with commanding ease". She performs solo, as a duo with her husband Ned Cartwright and with a band comprising Al Cherry (guitars), Ned Cartwright (piano, saxophone and melodica), Sam Burgess (electric and acoustic bass) and Bex Burch (drums and percussion).|$|E
500|$|Laborintus II {{combines}} orchestral, choral {{and spoken}} elements throughout its three parts. Patton's spoken narration is delivered in Italian, although taped samples feature Sanguineti speaking in English. From a <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> a shout, the words carry {{a variety of}} emotional tones as the work progresses. The choral parts respond to the narration both with unified chanting and with disjointed arguing, the latter serving to increase the tension. They are accompanied by three female vocalists whose voices range from soprano singing to [...] "cooing" [...] and [...] "howling".|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Herbert {{was signed}} to the Universal Classics and Jazz label and released, in September 2004, her first major label album, Bittersweet and Blue. This {{comprised}} mainly standards, but also included three original tracks by Herbert and Rutter. Herbert's version of Neil Young's [...] "Only Love Can Break Your Heart", taken from this album, was {{featured on the}} soundtrack of romantic comedy Leap Year, directed by Anand Tucker and starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. John Fordham, in a four-starred review of the album for The Guardian, praised Herbert's [...] "precociously powerful chemistry of taste and meticulous care for every sound– from a <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> an exhortation".|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} one of the most {{acclaimed}} of the show, receiving numerous awards and nominations. Several cast and crew members were nominated for their work on the show during its third season at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. Chandra Wilson received a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in [...] "Oh, the Guilt", the season's fifth episode, whereas Sandra Oh was nominated for the same category for her portrayal of Cristina Yang in [...] "From a <b>Whisper</b> <b>to</b> a Scream", the season's ninth episode. However, they both lost to co-star Katherine Heigl, whose portrayal of Izzie Stevens in [...] "Time After Time", the twentieth episode of the season, resulted in her first Emmy win.|$|E
500|$|Decorating of the Bride [...] ( [...] ; [...] ) {{measures}} [...] The {{painting is}} set in an impoverished 19th-century ethnic Albanian household. It shows {{the women of the}} family adorning a young bride. The jewelry that the bride is supposed to wear at her wedding is taken from an old wooden chest that {{can be seen in the}} left-hand corner and is temporarily set against a copper tray beside her. Immediately next to the chest, a little girl holds another copper tray, which also contains several items of jewelry. Two elderly women attend to the bride. To the far right, young maidens fashion a garland of fresh flowers and joyfully <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> one another. The room in which the women have gathered is sparsely furnished, with a low ceiling, well worn carpet and plain plastered walls. The bride wears traditional garb, with a gold necklace around her neck and delicately embroidered slippers on her feet. The artist's signature, Germanicized as P. Joanowitch, can be seen at the bottom right.|$|E

500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes down to what you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> really belting it out, and you need a microphone that can handle the range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with his}} work on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), he began to {{approach}} different chorus pedals, flangers and delays. Musically, he experimented with heavier guitar riffs on Box Car Racer (2002), while making greater use of pedals and loops. Blink-182 broke up in 2005 and DeLonge altered his equipment setup for his work from Angels & Airwaves' We Don't Need to <b>Whisper</b> <b>to</b> the present. He began pairing Voxes [...] and Fender '65 Twin Reverbs. DeLonge now uses the Vox AC30 with very little distortion.|$|E
2500|$|After Barrera’s {{death in}} 2001—his body {{reportedly}} {{found in the}} exact spot where he found the girl’s body fifty years before—the area became a popular tourist attraction where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as “charmed”—not haunted—even though travelers claim the dolls <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> them. Professional photographer Cindy Vasko visited the nightmarish island in 2015 and described it as the [...] "creepiest place [...] ever visited". The excursion began through maze-like canals, surrounded by lush greenery and beautiful singing birds, but soon her boat was slowed down by a swarm of lily pads and the canal fell ominously silent. She told MailOnline: [...] "At {{the end of the}} journey, the trajinera turned along a bend in the waterway and I was struck by a surreal vision of hundreds, maybe thousands, of dolls hanging from trees on the tiny island." [...] The dolls are still on the island, which is accessible by boat. The island was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Adventures and the Amazon Prime show Lore (TV series).|$|E

2500|$|In May, {{the number}} of Ebola cases {{appeared}} to be decreasing and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) closed a treatment facility in the Macenta region because the outbreak of Ebola there {{appeared to have been}} resolved. [...] At the time it was thought that the new cases were caused by people returning from Liberia or from Sierra Leone, however it was later suggested that villagers had become fearful and were hiding cases rather than reporting them. [...] Seeing workers wearing the required protection outfits worn by health workers and taking those suspected of having Ebola or of being contacts to the treatment center (perhaps never to be seen again), refusing the usual burial rituals when a patient died, and other actions taken by the unfamiliar individuals that had come to their remote areas, had led to rumors of organ harvesting and government and tribal plots. [...] According to a September [...] news report, [...] "Many Guineans say local and foreign healthcare workers are part of a conspiracy which either deliberately introduced the outbreak, or invented it as a means of luring Africans to clinics to harvest their blood and organs." [...] As described in another news article, [...] "The health workers don’t look like any people you’ve ever seen. They perform stiffly and slowly, and then they disappear into the tent where your mother or brother may be, and everything that happens inside is left to your imagination. Villagers began to <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> one another—They’re harvesting our organs; they’re taking our limbs". [...] Moreover, due to fear, many people are avoiding hospital treatment for any ailment and are self-treating with over the counter drugs from a pharmacy.|$|E
2500|$|... "You Gotta Make It Through the World" [...] is {{according}} to Morrison, [...] "a survival song". [...] Dr. John {{felt that it}} had [...] "a real spiritual sound". [...] "It Fills You Up" [...] is an attempt [...] by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music. [...] "The Eternal Kansas City" [...] is, {{according to}} Dr. John, [...] "the song that Van got the whole album hooked up around. [...] It was a real deep {{thing for him to}} focus on. [...] It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R" [...] The song, [...] "Joyous Sound" [...] is described by Brian Hinton as [...] "more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves." [...] Morrison said of the track, [...] "Flamingos Fly", [...] "I've done three versions in the studio. [...] I've done it slow, a ballad version. [...] I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. [...] This is the version I like best for release." [...] "Heavy Connection" [...] is said to be [...] "psychic stuff" [...] with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking [...] of a love connection [...] "when you came into my dreams/like from a <b>whisper</b> <b>to</b> a scream." [...] The last song on the album is [...] "Cold Wind in August". [...] Dr. John describes it as a [...] "cross current from forties to seventies music. [...] It's like where Ray Charles left off. [...] It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music." [...] "Flamingos Fly" [...] was covered by Sammy Hagar, a year before A Period of Transition was released, on his first solo album Nine on a Ten Scale.|$|E

Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own daughter what her grandfather <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> her as he was dying.
