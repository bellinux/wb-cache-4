He also edged out Terrelle Pryor as the Big Ten Conference Most Valuable Player as voted by the Big Ten coaches, although both had the same number of first place votes. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> team All-American selection by the Football Writers Association of America as a running back, a third team selection by the Associated Press as an all-purpose player, and an honorable mention quarterback selection by Sports Illustrated and College Football News. He finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting.|$|E

5|$|He {{played for}} Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. He was {{selected}} to play in both the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game and the 2014 Jordan Brand Classic.

The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth-seeded Devils {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. This would be too much for Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.|$|E

5|$|Nothing is {{mentioned}} of Strez until {{the events in}} the wake of the sudden death of Tsar Kaloyan (1197–1207) during his siege of the Crusader-held Thessaloniki. Just like Alexius Slav, another noble who would later emerge as a separatist, Strez was a nephew of the Asen brothers Peter, Ivan Asen and Kaloyan, who were the first three emperors of the Second Bulgarian Empire. However, it is unclear whether through his relation to the early Asens he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> cousin or a brother of Boril (1207–1218).|$|E

Spider-Man 3 was also released in China on May 3, 2007 to circumvent market growth of unlicensed copies of the film. The studio's release of a film in China before its domestic release <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> for Sony Pictures Releasing International.

5|$|The PTBT <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> of {{a series}} of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} {{in the second half of}} 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E

5|$|The {{critic and}} screenwriter Saeroen, writing for Pemandangan, praised Kedok Ketawa, {{especially}} its cinematography {{and the beauty}} of its scenery; he compared the film to imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> production. Another review, in Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting.|$|E

5|$|A {{roof was}} {{restored}} to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating {{with the addition of}} a roof to the Stretford End (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper floodlighting, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>First</b> Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.|$|E
5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|Because of his height, Ulis was {{overlooked}} {{until well}} into the recruiting process for top basketball schools. He was not highly recruited until his 201314 senior year of high school. Among schools regarded as high-major programs, only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year. His other offers were from Dayton, Colorado State, Loyola, Northern Illinois and Oregon State. During his junior season, his stock soared and Marian Catholic started winning. In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A sectional round, Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round. Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team, it established a school record for wins with a 294 record and it won its IHSA sectional for the first time. Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> team All-state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker, Okafor, Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson.|$|E

5|$|Boston Celtics on December 8, Hardaway {{earned his}} first NBA start. With Carmelo Anthony and Raymond Felton sitting out the Christmas Day {{game against the}} Oklahoma City Thunder, Hardaway matched his career high with 21 points. Hardaway {{was one of three}} nominees for Eastern Conference NBA Rookie of the Month for December. Hardaway {{received}} a lot of publicity for a January 9 dunk over Ray Allen. On January 29, he was named a Rising Stars Challenge participant as part of the 2014 NBA All-Star Game weekend. The following night Hardaway set a career high with a game high (tied with Carmelo Anthony) 29 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Hardaway was one of four nominees for Eastern Conference NBA Rookie of the Month for January. In the February 14 Rising Stars Challenge, Hardaway had 36 points, including 7 three point shots, many coming in a one-on-one battle with Dion Waiters. Hardaway was one of three finalists for February Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month, but he lost to Victor Oladipo. After stringing together three consecutive 20-point games, Hardaway was a finalist for NBA Player of the Week on March 17 and for Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month in March. He was also a finalist for Eastern Conference Player of the Month in April. Hardaway finished fifth in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award balloting. As a result of his fifth-place finish in the separate NBA All-Rookie Team voting he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> team NBA All-Rookie selection.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>First</b> World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E
5|$|Dora Caroline Stevens {{was born}} on October 26, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens. Her father was a pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church for forty years and her mother <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> {{generation}} immigrant from Holland. One of four children, Stevens grew up in Omaha and graduated in 1905 from Omaha High School. She went on to further her education graduating from Oberlin College in 1911 {{with a degree in}} sociology, though she had originally pursued music. While in college, she was known for her romances and for being a spirited suffragette. Her unruly behavior and disdain for feminine propriety were cultivated during her college years. After graduation, Stevens worked as a music teacher and social worker in Ohio, Michigan. and Montana before moving to Washington, D.C., where she became a regional organizer with the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).|$|E
