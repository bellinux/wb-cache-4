Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional <b>works,</b> <b>or</b> larger altarpieces for liturgical settings.

5|$|Although Orion has a {{few lines}} in both Homeric poems and in the Works and Days, {{most of the stories}} about him are {{recorded}} in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference <b>works</b> <b>or</b> encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the Astronomy, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Allen {{was born}} in Litchfield, Connecticut, the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen, both of English and Puritan descent. The family moved {{to the town of}} Cornwall shortly after his birth. The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen's father's quest for freedom of {{religion}} during a time of turmoil: the Great Awakening, when Puritans were separating into churches with differing dogmas, in particular about the proper form of conversion: by <b>works</b> <b>or</b> by grace. His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father's refusal to convert to the covenant by grace. As a boy Allen already excelled at quoting the Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages.|$|E

5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the <b>works</b> <b>or</b> artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} the {{fourteen}} Black Paintings that Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the Quinta del Sordo. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the <b>works</b> <b>or</b> leave record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, Witches' Sabbath is generally seen by art historians as a satire on the credulity of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the witch trials of the Spanish Inquisition. As with the other works in the group, Witches' Sabbath reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as well as the Disasters of War print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque style {{relatively}} late and retained and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the thirteenth century.

However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors. From the thirteenth century there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies. Native craftsmanship can be seen in a variety of items.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{changes in}} {{mode of transportation}} to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy, to describe levels of physical activity related to mode of transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school, and to examine associations between changes in mode of transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school and educational level, body mass index (BMI) and age. Methods: Between September 2009 and February 2013, 575 healthy pregnant nulliparous women were included into the Norwegian Fit for Delivery (NFFD) trial. At inclusion they reported their current and their pre-pregnancy mode of transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school. Data were analysed by multilevel mixed models with dichotomized modes of transportation as dependent variables. Results: There was a significant change towards less active transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school {{and a decrease in}} level of physical activity from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy, 58 % used private transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school, compared to 64 % in early pregnancy (p =  0. 001). The percentage of women who biked (11 % v. 5 %, p <  0. 001) decreased significantly from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy. Conclusions: In this sample of Norwegian women there was a significant change towards less active transportation to <b>work</b> <b>or</b> school and lower levels of physical activity from pre-pregnancy to early pregnancy...|$|R

5|$|There is {{relatively}} little information about native Scottish artists {{during the late}} Middle Ages. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits used for copies and reproductions, but the versions that survive are generally crude by continental standards. Much more impressive are the <b>works</b> <b>or</b> artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth; the tabernacles and images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld, and vestments and hangings in Holyrood; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named, and the illustrated Flemish Bening Book of Hours, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as actual work did not begin until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic <b>Works</b> <b>or</b> the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had to use their own money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E

5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three thematic and tonal areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode <b>works)</b> <b>or</b> to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the character of a development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new tonal area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque {{in the late}} twelfth century, {{retaining}} and reviving elements of its style after the Gothic had become dominant elsewhere from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and of the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors like the sacrament houses at Deskford and Kinkell and the carvings of the seven deadly sins at Rosslyn Chapel. From the thirteenth century, there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies like the elaborate Douglas tombs {{in the town of}} Douglas. Native craftsmanship can be seen in items like the Bute mazer and the Savernake Horn, and more widely in the large number of high quality seals that survive from the mid thirteenth century onwards. Visual illustration {{can be seen in the}} illumination of charters, and occasional survivals like the fifteenth century Doom painting at Guthrie.
