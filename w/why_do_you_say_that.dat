6000|$|ANN. [with some impatience] <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that?</b> Is it unwomanly to be {{thoughtful}} and businesslike and sensible? Do you want Violet {{to be an}} idiot--or something worse, like me? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> to me?" [...] demanded Halleck, impatiently. [...] "Am I {{a nervous}} woman, that I {{must be kept}} from {{unpleasant}} sights and disagreeable experiences? If there's anything of the man about me, you insult it! Why not be a little sorry for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure I {{should never}} have been happy, Beric, if she had died in the arena. I should always have had it before my eyes--I should have dreamt of it.

6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I dislike your poesy [1]? I have {{expressed}} no such opinion, either in print or elsewhere.

6000|$|... "Why so? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> torment me? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> banish me at once, {{and tell}} me that I must go home a wretched, miserable man? Why?--why?--why? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You arouse my curiosity," [...] said I. [...] "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{just now}} that there were very {{particular}} reasons why I should study this case?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a lie," [...] {{said one}} of the judges roughly. [...] "You told the captain that Marcus had been her lover. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{it means}} nothing? It means everything. [...] No man was ever more in earnest in {{speaking}} to a lady than [...] I am with you.

6000|$|CLEOPATRA (her fears returning). <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> Caesar? Indeed, indeed, I am not hiding anything. You {{are wrong}} {{to treat me}} like this. (She stifles a sob.) I am only a child; and you turn into stone because you think some one has been killed. I cannot bear it. (She {{purposely}} breaks down and weeps. He looks at her with profound sadness and complete coldness. She {{looks up to see}} what effect she is producing. Seeing that he is unmoved, she sits up, pretending to struggle with her emotion and to put it bravely away.) But there: I know you hate tears: you shall not be troubled with them.

On hearing that a brahmana was accusing the King of not properly protecting him, Arjuna became inquisitive and approached the brahmana. He said, [...] "My dear brahmana, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there are no proper kshatriyas to protect the citizens of your country? Is there not even someone who can pretend to be a kshatriya, who can carry a bow and arrow at least to make a show of protection? Do you think that all the royal personalities in this country simply engage in performing sacrifices with the brahmanaskshatriyas should not sit back comfortably and engage only in performing Vedic rituals. Rather, they must be very chivalrous in protecting the citizens. Brahmanas, being engaged in spiritual activities, are not expected to do anything which requires physical endeavor. Therefore, they need to be protected by the kshatriyas so {{that they will not be}} disturbed in the execution of their higher occupational duties. but have no chivalrous power?"
