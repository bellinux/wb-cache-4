5|$|A {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} this last idea {{occurred in the}} game Pintér–Brynell at the 1998 Elista Olympiad. White answered Black's 21...b5 with 22.b4!, and Black was unable to keep the queenside open with 22...bxa4? because 23.bxc5 Rxb1 24.Rxb1 dxc5 25.Bxc5 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> White's central pawns unstoppable. After the game's 22...c4 23.a5! Qe7 24.Bd4 Black's queenside play had ground to a halt; Pintér later won with a pawn advance on the kingside.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. These <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and this fact would explain also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, a town {{planning}} {{report for the}} City of Perth noted traffic congestion on Albany Road in Victoria Park. As widening the existing road <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the council liable for compensation from affected businesses and properties, the provision of bypass routes was recommended instead. To provide the bypasses, parallel roads would be upgraded and extended: Berwick Street to the south-west, and Shepparton Road to the north-east.|$|E

5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom {{was found not}} to have any of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|Watchmen is an American comic-book limited series {{published}} by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, and collected in 1987. The series {{was created by}} a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters {{that the company had}} acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.|$|E

5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the first of a series of internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied {{aircraft}} construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport aircraft to the USA. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different aircraft to be developed to specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to fulfil Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E

50|$|On January 1, 2015, McRae and the {{adjacent}} town of Helena merged to form McRae-Helena. This merge was initiated because Helena could not manage the city’s wastewater capacity. If McRae took on Helena’s water services, Helena <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>left</b> with less revenue, and it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>left</b> providing only two services. Therefore, the cities were united with House Bill 967, sponsored by Representative Jimmy Pruett of the 149th district. It was {{signed into law}} by Governor Nathan Deal on April 10, 2014.|$|R
5|$|Moon took {{lessons from}} one of the loudest {{contemporary}} drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch's Carlo Little, at ten shillings per lesson. Moon's early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). Moon also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, the Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> to play for the California band even {{at the peak of the}} Who's fame.|$|E
5|$|Sunland Park (pop. 13,309 in 2000), {{a suburb}} of El Paso, Texas, in Doña Ana County, New Mexico, is the largest {{community}} of New Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase. Lordsburg, New Mexico (pop. 3,379 in 2000), the county seat of Hidalgo County, was in the disputed area before the Gadsden Purchase, and Deming, New Mexico, the county seat of Luna County, was north of both the Mexican and American land claims before the Gadsden Purchase, though the proposed Bartlett–Conde compromise of 1851 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> it in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The 1971 Local Government White Paper {{proposed}} abolishing county boroughs, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> Plymouth, {{a town of}} 250,000 people, being administered from {{a council}} based at the smaller Exeter, {{on the other side}} of the county. This led to Plymouth lobbying for the creation of a Tamarside county, to include Plymouth, Torpoint, Saltash, and the rural hinterland. The campaign was not successful, and Plymouth ceased to be a county borough on 1 April 1974 with responsibility for education, social services, highways and libraries transferred to Devon County Council. All powers returned when the city become a unitary authority on 1 April 1998 under recommendations of the Banham Commission.|$|E

5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{academic}} publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology {{for a more}} general audience, {{both of which were}} published by Channel 4 Books as a spin-off from the Time Team television series. The first of these was Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology, co-written with Carenza Lewis and Phil Harding and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the Palaeolithic through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> behind in the archaeological record. This was followed in 2002 by Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide, which Aston co-wrote with Tony Robinson and dedicated to Harding. Archaeology is Rubbish describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.|$|E
5|$|Ancestors were worshiped in Qatna; {{the royal}} hypogeum {{provided}} {{a large amount}} of data concerning the cult of ancestor worshiping and the practices associated with it. Two kinds of burials are distinguished; a primary burial intended to transport the dead into the netherworld, and a secondary burial that was intended to transform the deceased into their ultimate form: an ancestor. The royal hypogeum provides hints at the different rituals taking place during a secondary burial; a noticeable character is that skeletons were not complete, and no skulls are found for the majority of secondary burial remains. There is no evidence that skulls decayed as they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> behind teeth, of which very few were found, indicating that the skulls were removed to be venerated in another location.|$|E
5|$|There {{are around}} 31hill forts in Dorset; {{archaeologist}} Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts {{were used to}} control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.|$|E
