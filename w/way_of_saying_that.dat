500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1970, Pink Floyd {{released}} Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in France in January, but {{disagreements over}} the mix prompted {{the hiring of}} Ron Geesin {{to work out the}} sound issues. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was [...] "A neat <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he didn't... do anything". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were [...] "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as [...] "a load of rubbish", stating: [...] "I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period". Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Seth MacFarlane responded to Palin's criticism, saying that the series always uses satire as the basis of its humor, and that the show is an [...] "equal-opportunity offender." [...] In addition, Andrea Fay Friedman, who voiced Ellen, and who herself has Down syndrome, also responded to the criticisms saying that the joke was aimed at Sarah Palin and not her son, and that [...] "former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor." [...] In a subsequent interview, Friedman rebuked Palin, accusing her of using her son, Trig, as a political prop to pander for votes, saying that she has a normal life and that Palin's son should be treated as normal, rather than like a [...] "loaf of French bread." [...] Later, MacFarlane addressed both Palin's statement and Friedman's rebuttal in an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher calling Palin's outrage a presumptuous attempt to defend people with Down syndrome, and characterizing Friedman's statement as her <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> she does not need feigned pity from Palin. Family Guy cast member Patrick Warburton stated that he objected to the joke, saying, [...] "I know {{that you have to be}} an equal-opportunity offender, but there are some things that I just don't think are funny." [...] While frequent MacFarlane critic Parents Television Council touched on the Palin controversy in its assessment of the episode, the rest of the show's content—which contained [...] "mean-spirited pot-shots, explicit language, and strong sexual content"—earned the watchdog group's [...] "Worst TV Show of the Week" [...] title. The PTC specifically cited the Broadway-style song, which the PTC said [...] "contained all the stereotypes of mental retardation" [...] and [...] "disturbing sexual references," [...] and the climatic scene in the subplot, where Peter pretends to be a psychic, which the PTC said also contained sexual humor.|$|E

2500|$|Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine {{in several}} {{parts of the}} ancient world during the early {{historical}} epoch. [...] Euripides' play [...] "Helen" [...] depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda.

2500|$|Wittgenstein's work {{expresses the}} omnipotence paradox {{as a problem}} in semantics—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort [...] "That's only semantics," [...] is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> a {{statement}} only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the Tractatus, then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the Tractatus gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: [...] "What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{fans have}} speculated that this song was a tribute to Grohl's {{deceased}} friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain.

40|$|The {{only good}} is {{knowledge}} and the only evil is ignorance. —Socrates i According to Bayesian confirmation theory, evidence E (incrementally) confirms (or supports) a hypothesis H (roughly) just in case E and H are positively prob-abilistically correlated (under an appropriate probability function Pr).

[...] Ernst also commented that the quality of five of the six trials he had reviewed was [...] "deplorably poor," [...] a sentiment which echoed an August 2012 review that noted the [...] "moderate methodological quality of the included studies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jo-Han limped {{through the}} 1980s re-issuing old kits and promos. The company gave {{up trying to}} retail its models and set up a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have {{sometimes}} been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time. Models were carefully prepared and respected by collectors, but there was no capital to develop new products, so the company fell into decline. One consumer purchase update card sent by X-El Products to buyers in 1988 encouraged patience when waiting for models that wer ordered, saying, [...] "These promos are not done on a mass production basis. They are practically made to order and babied from start to finish." [...] This is another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Jo-Han did not have the resources to improve their service. Nevertheless, the reproductions from this time have also escalated in collector value and were as well rendered as the original period promos, done with accurate color schemes.|$|E

25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are just different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|R
2500|$|Brown was {{credited}} with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings. [...] He {{had a reputation for}} extreme pace and was widely known as [...] "Brown of Brighton". [...] He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat. [...] Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that [...] "Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon", an elaborate <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> they were both extremely fast. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Sompting, Sussex.|$|E

The song was originally written with the line [...] "I shouted out 'Who killed Kennedy?'" [...] After Robert F. Kennedy's death on 6 June 1968, the line was changed to [...] "Who killed the Kennedys?"

2500|$|Paul the Apostle in {{addressing}} slavery in Ephesians 6:-8 neither condemns slavery nor condones it. Nothing {{in the passage}} affirms slavery as a naturally valid or divinely mandated institution. [...] Rather, Paul’s discussion of the duties of Christian slaves and the responsibilities of Christian masters transforms the institution, even if it falls short of calling for outright abolition. In the ancient world the slave was a thing. Aristotle wrote that there could never be friendship between master and slave, for master and slave have nothing in common: “a slave is a living tool, just as a tool is an inanimate slave.” [...] Paul’s words are entirely different. He calls the slave a “slave of Christ,” one who wants to do “the will of God” and who will receive a “reward” for “whatever good he does”. [...] Likewise, the master is responsible to God for how he treats the slave, who is ultimately God’s rather than his own property. This is another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the slave, {{no less than the}} master, has been made in God’s image. As such, he possesses inestimable worth and great dignity. He is to be treated properly. In such a framework slavery, even though it remained slavery, could never be the same institution as for non-Christians. [...] Tradition describes Pope Pius I (term c. 158-167) and Pope Callixtus I (term c. 217-222) as former slaves.|$|E
