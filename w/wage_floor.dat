Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] – This article describes how the voluntary Living Wage in the UK is set. It examines how this calculation relates to contemporary approaches to setting <b>wage</b> <b>floors,</b> both {{in relation to their}} goal of supporting adequate living standards and in relation to the place of <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> in the labour market. Approach – The article examines how compulsory and voluntary <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> are being determined, in the UK and in particular the role of public consensus in contributing to the calculation and adoption of a living wage. It then reflects on the future sustainability of a system of <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> in which the concept of the living wage plays a significant role. Findings – The central finding is that widespread support for wages delivering socially acceptable minimum living standards has transformed the context in which low pay is being addressed in the United Kingdom. The living wage idea has stimulated more decisive efforts to do so; however, if a compulsory version of a living wage were to reach a level shown to be harming jobs, this could seriously undermine such efforts. Moreover, the extent to which adequate wages are compatible with high employment levels can also be influenced by state support for households, especially tax credits and Universal Credit. Originality/value – The article clarifies how the setting of the UK Living Wage contributes to objectives related both to living standards and to labour markets, and critically addresses some key issues raised...|$|R

40|$|In Portugal, as in {{many other}} {{countries}} in continental Europe, the collective wage agreements between trade unions and employer associations that define <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> for specific job titles are systematically extended to the whole industry.

In this paper we provide evidence that firms that are more heavily affected by the change in the bargained <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> decrease their hiring rates and, more importantly, significantly increase their separation rates. As a complement to our analysis, we suggest the estimation of a measure that attempts to disentangle the strength of internal and external wage conditions.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to earn income from a job and receive Arbeitslosengeld II benefits at the same time. Job income is debited from Arbeitslosengeld II payments according to a formula that leaves {{a certain amount of}} the additional revenue untouched. These revenues are: a certain amount of savings (which increases with age); €100 plus 20 percent of the wage up to €800 plus 10% of the wage up to €1200 (up to €1500 if there are children). Through this mechanism Arbeitslosengeld II can be regarded as a sort of minimum <b>wage</b> <b>floor</b> for employees without assets, where the minimum wage is not fully paid by the employer but assured by the state.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the effect of {{openness}} to trade on process innovations and skill premia importantly depends on the structure of labor markets in developed countries.

Our analysis focuses on Germany which provides an interesting context to test this hypothesis, due to its large scale apprenticeship programme and its collective bargaining system {{that is based on}} voluntary union recognition. To guide the empirical analysis, we first develop a model of firm-financed training. A novel feature of our model is that a unionised and non-unionised sector coexist, and only unionised firms are bound by union wages. The model creates a rich set of empirical implications regarding apprenticeship training, layoffs, wage cuts, and wage compression in unionised and non-unionised firms. Our empirical analysis is based on firm panel data matched with administrative employee data, and provides strong support for our model. Our main results are that unionisation increases training, and that <b>wage</b> <b>floors</b> and <b>wage</b> compression play a more important role in unionised than in non-unionised firms...|$|R
