25|$|Seiches {{can also}} be induced by tsunami, a <b>wave</b> <b>train</b> (series of waves) {{generated}} in {{a body of water}} by a pulsating or abrupt disturbance that vertically displaces the water column. On occasion, tsunamis can produce seiches as a result of local geographic peculiarities. For instance, the tsunami that hit Hawaii in 1946 had a fifteen-minute interval between wave fronts. The natural resonant period of Hilo Bay is about thirty minutes. That meant that every second wave was in phase with the motion of Hilo Bay, creating a seiche in the bay. As a result, Hilo suffered worse damage than any other place in Hawaii, with the tsunami/seiche reaching a height of 26 feet along the Hilo Bayfront, killing 96 people in the city alone. Seiche waves may continue for several days after a tsunami.|$|E

Two gravity <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> of 2. 1 - 3 mb amplitude, 2. 5 - 3. 3 h period and 240 - 265 km horizontal wavelength were isolated through power spectra analysis and cross-correlation techniques applied to National Weather Service barograph traces. The <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> propagated in the 200 deg direction, which coincided with the jet axis, with a phase velocity of 20 - 30 m/s and within a 300 km wide band. The storms were identified on enhanced infrared GOES satellite pictures with the help of radar summaries. These convective systems initially developed in Nebraska and propagated north-northeast at 25 m/s, revealing wave-like characteristics with a separation of 300 - 400 km. The convective systems were closely linked to the observed <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> with cell intensity, height and associated rainfall maximized at the wave ridge.

The upstream propagation of an incision, as usually depicted by a knickpoint migration, is thought to depend on several parameters such as the drainage area, lithology, and the amplitude of the base level drop. We first investigate {{the case of the}} Messinian Salinity Crisis that was characterized by the extreme base level fall (1500 m) of the Mediterranean Sea {{at the end of the}} Miocene. The response of drainage areas of three orders of magnitude (103 to 106 km 2) highlights the dominant role of the drainage area (with a square root relationship) in controlling the knickpoint migration after a base level fall. A compilation of mean rates of knickpoint propagation for time durations ranging from 102 to 107 years displays a similar relationship indicating that successive <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> of knickpoint can migrate in a river: first, <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> linked to the release of the alluvial cover and then, <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> related to the bedrock incision, which correspond to the real time response of rivers. <b>Wave</b> <b>trains</b> with very low retreat rates (long lived knickpoints > 1 My) rather correspond to the response time of regional landscape...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} non-perturbative {{technique}} to study pulse dynamics in excitable media.

40|$|When {{strong winds}} blow over shallow {{water for a}} long duration, wind induced {{currents}} are generated. At the same time wind waves are evolved on them untill the waves break such as white cups. The heigher the wind wave heights evolve, the more the breaking of waves of particular wave heights and periods resonant with the wind speed may become predominant. At this circumstance the wind acts on the waves as a driving force. As the result of these interaction between winds and waves, we may often observe progressive breaking waves without deformation of their profiles, The breaking phenomena are named the 'Breaking wave trains', The waves are vitally important in studying shore processes, as they deeply concern with near - shore currents and sand drifts in a surf zone. Hydraulic experiments, {{as the first step}} to find out properties of the breaking <b>wave</b> <b>trains,</b> were carried out with a recirculating wind wave tank which can reproduce wind - generated random waves accompanied with currents.

The wind - induced currents have {{an important role in the}} mass transport in the <b>wave</b> <b>trains.</b> Because of the strong currents, the wave field may be considered as a unidirectional flow, and there exists a critical depth which is nearly equal to the mean depth of the breaking <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> in a reference frame moving with the <b>wave</b> <b>trains</b> at a speed of the wave celerity.
