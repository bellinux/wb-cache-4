According to Dave Cullen, Harris, who conceived the attacks, was a [...] "cold-blooded, predatory psychopath" [...] and an intelligent, charming liar with [...] "a preposterously grand superiority complex, a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control". In Cullen's assessment, Harris lacked remorse or empathy for others, and sought to punish them for their perceived inferiority. According to Principal Frank DeAngelis, Harris was [...] "the type of kid who, when he was in front of adults, he'd tell you <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear." ...|$|E

But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I {{had been told that}} if the King {{employed}} an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.|$|E

I don't know. But I do get a kind of sneaking pleasure out {{of the fact that you}} knew <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do and did it. Well, those folks in there will try to bully you, and tame you down. Tell 'em to go to the devil! I'll back you. Take your factory job, if you want to. Don't be scared of the family.

60|$|His {{eyes were}} dark and very fine, and his {{delightful}} voice accompanied their visible language like music. He {{appeared to be}} exceedingly appreciative of whatever was passing among those who surrounded him, and especially of the vicissitudes in {{the consciousness of the}} person to whom he happened to be addressing himself at the moment. I felt that no effect upon my mind of what he uttered, no emotion, however transitory, in myself, escaped his notice, though not from any positive vigilance on his part, but because his faculty of observation was so penetrative and delicate; and to say the truth, it a little confused me to discern always a ripple on his mobile face, responsive to any slightest breeze that passed over the inner reservoir of my sentiments, and seemed thence to extend to a similar reservoir within himself. On matters of feeling, and within a certain depth, you might spare yourself the trouble of utterance, because he already knew <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> say, and perhaps a little more than you would have spoken. His figure was full of gentle movement, though, somehow, without disturbing its quietude; and as he talked, he kept folding his hands nervously, and betokened in many ways a fine and immediate sensibility, quick to feel pleasure or pain, though scarcely capable, I should imagine, of a passionate experience in either direction. There was not am English trait in him from head to foot, morally, intellectually, or physically. Beef, ale, or stout, brandy or port-wine, entered not at all into his composition. In his earlier life, he appears to have given evidences of courage and sturdy principle, and of a tendency to fling himself into the rough struggle of humanity on the liberal side. It would be taking too much upon myself to affirm that this was merely a projection of his fancy world into the actual, and that he never could have hit a downright blow, and was altogether an unsuitable person to receive one. I beheld him not in his armor, but in his peacefulest robes. Nevertheless, drawing my conclusion merely from what I saw, it would have occurred to me that his main deficiency was a lack of grit. Though anything but a timid man, the combative and defensive elements were not prominently developed in his character, and could have been made available only when he put an unnatural force upon his instincts. It was on this account, and also because of the fineness of his nature generally, that the English appreciated him no better, and left this sweet and delicate poet poor, and with scanty laurels in his declining age.|$|E
