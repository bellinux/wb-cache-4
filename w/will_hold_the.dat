5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E
5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} {{chanting}} of the Symbol of the Faith (Nicene Creed), the Priest will kiss the Diskos and Chalice (by kissing the Aër {{in the place}} where it touches each vessel) and the front edge of the Holy Table.

When a bishop is serving the Liturgy, the concelebrating priests <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> Aër during the Creed as the bishop kneels (or bows his head) underneath it.

The suspenders also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.|$|E

25|$|Kansas City {{is home to}} {{the largest}} {{municipal}} government in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government.

Ledger's family attended the ceremony on 22 February 2009, with his parents and sister accepting the award on stage on his behalf. Following talks with the Ledger family in Australia, the Academy determined that Ledger's daughter, Matilda Rose, would own the award. However, due to Matilda's age, she will not gain full ownership of the statuette until her eighteenth birthday in 2023. Until that time, her mother Michelle Williams, <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> statuette in trust for Matilda.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{there are}} {{only a small number of}} ants in any given area on the plant stem. There are about 40 workers per leaf, but {{generally}} only a few will be patrolling outside. Once an insect lands on the plant, the closest ant will immediately surface and grab on to a leg, antenna, wing, or some other appendage of the prey. This ant will pull the prey, which will try to escape by pulling in the opposite direction. However, the ant will rarely let go of its grip. The ant immobilizes the prey and, using an extreme feat of strength, <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> much larger prey to the plant as more ants from around that area arrive. This ability to hold the prey is extremely important because the ants move and congregate fairly slowly.|$|E

A new company was created called Cricket Holdings America LLC. This new company <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> rights to hold Twenty20 leagues within the United States.

25|$|The U.S. House of Representatives had {{the right}} to make the final {{determination}} as to whether Buchanan <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> seat {{for the remainder of the}} term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election. In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida’s 13th district House race to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). On 25 February 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} two-man crew the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes <b>will</b> <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> train.
