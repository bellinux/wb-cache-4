5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work with female voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E
25|$|A web-based survey {{suggested}} that over 70% {{of those surveyed}} wanted {{less than or equal}} to 2 weeks in space; in addition, 88% wanted to spacewalk (only 14% of these <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for a 50% premium), and 21% wanted a hotel or space station.|$|E
25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} gone to war to defend Finland, {{there was no way that}} they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for Norway.|$|E

25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E
25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E

[...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I may not have very much money, after all--and, if I had, {{is there any reason}} why you should be willing to give up more than I <b>would?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> matter so very much that I may, perhaps, be a little richer than you are?" ...|$|R

[...] Feldman {{and nine}} {{other of the}} team's top young pitchers were brought to Arlington in November for a week-long conditioning camp. [...] "It's different", Feldman said.

500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Douglas adopted Boddy's [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] {{nickname}} for Nixon, and {{also referred to}} him as [...] "pee wee". Her name-calling {{had an effect on}} Nixon: when told she had called him [...] "a young man with a dark shirt" [...] in an allusion to Nazism, he inquired, [...] "Did she say that? Why, I'll castrate her." [...] Campaign official Bill Arnold joked that {{it would be difficult to}} do, and Nixon replied that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> anyway. Nixon returned the attacks; at friendly gatherings and especially at all-male events, he stated that Douglas was [...] "pink right down to her underwear".|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} The Decision, James {{claimed that}} there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. During the 2010–11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, [...] " [...] probably <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision." [...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{received}} {{attention from the}} Australian Family Association, with spokesman John Morrissey {{saying that he was}} concerned about TV [...] "normalising" [...] same-sex relationships. Psychologist Dr Janet Hall praised the storyline, saying it allows families to discuss the topic. Susan Bower defended the kiss, which was shot before the Home and Away controversy, saying [...] "Ours is a lovely tale about friendship. It's very innocent." [...] She added [...] "If {{we were going to do}} a lesbian story – and [...] "Neighbours" [...] is not against lesbian stories – we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> properly.

Lived alone and locked myself away (like a moody 260-lb. monk) in Budapest for 6 months while filming. Goal was to completely transform into this character. Disappear in the role. Press journalist asked me today, with the mental and physical toll the role had on me, <b>would</b> I <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again?

500|$|Joseph and Prince Kaunitz {{arranged}} the First Partition of Poland despite Maria Theresa's protestations. Her {{sense of justice}} pushed her to reject the idea of partition, which would hurt the Polish people. The duo {{argued that it was}} too late to abort now. Besides, Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with or without Austrian participation. Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took Galicia and Lodomeria, a province claimed by Hungarian monarchs since the 13thcentury; in the words of Frederick, [...] "the more she cried, the more she took".|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned we had to do it ourselves, because no one else <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Atchison {{started his}} {{screenplay}} in 1999, {{when he wrote}} a five-page treatment in about a month. In addition to the fact {{he was working on}} other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he [...] "thought someone else <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> first." [...] This did not happen, so he began to write by himself. Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that [...] "the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were always the same." ...|$|E

It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying [...] "We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're {{still trying to figure out}} Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he started}} working on his fourth studio album Confessions {{after the release of}} his 2001 album 8701, Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to {{continue}} creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like [...] "Burn", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were concerned because they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The concept became [...] "Confessions".|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is if they put in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they thought that was a good direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E
