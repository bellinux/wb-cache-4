500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E

[...] He did what {{he said it would}} be necessary to avoid doing. [...] He said, wrote, and allowed to be written exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wanted to avoid." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the [...] season, {{tensions}} escalated between Ryan Leslie {{and openly}} gay Preston Roberson-Charles, amid questions about Leslie's own sexuality, and their mutual use of homophobic slurs. In addition, Roberson-Charles also drew some homophobic remarks from housemate Ryan Knight. During the [...] season, tensions arose between Frank Sweeney and his male housemates Zach Nichols and Nate Stodghill over Sweeney's bisexuality, and Nichols later made <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{intended to be}} a humorous remark to lesbian roommate Sam McGinn that alluded to gay bashing, to which McGinn took exception. In the [...] season, Jenna Thomason made homophobic and racist comments toward her roommates, causing tension between her {{and the rest of the}} cast.|$|E

2500|$|... "Whilst Les (Camilleri) {{was going}} off, {{he pulled his}} knife out of a pocket in the driver's door. This was a black handled pocket knife with a {{serrated}} edge. Les turned around to the girls and showed them the knife. He told them to shut up and not to say anything. Les said {{if they did not}} do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> would stab them. During this Les told me to get my knife. I got my knife out of the glove box. I have a black handled knife with a jagged edge. I showed the girls I had a knife, too. I said to the girls to do as Les says. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was merely}} restating <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{had been told}} by James F. Byrnes, the United States Secretary of State. For refusing to remove limits on Jewish {{immigration}} to Palestine {{in the aftermath of the}} war, Bevin earned the hatred of Zionists. According to historian Howard Sachar, his political foe, Richard Crossman, a fellow Labour Party member of parliament and a pro-Zionist member of the post-war Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine, characterised his outlook during the dying days of the Mandate as [...] "corresponding roughly with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion", a Tsarist fabrication written to inflame anti-Semitic prejudice. In Sachar's account, Crossman intimated that [...] "the main points of Bevin's discourse were ... that the Jews had successfully organised a conspiracy against Britain and against him personally." [...] Bevin's biographer Alan Bullock rejected suggestions that Bevin was motivated by personal anti-Semitism.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have heard}} the ravings {{of a man in}} delirium. It is surely hard to hold Eustace {{responsible}} for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when <b>he</b> was out of his senses." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{burst into}} a passionate fit of weeping. Andor waited quietly until the first {{paroxysm}} of sobs had subsided, and she could hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> then <b>he</b> remarked quite quietly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Hardest of all {{to stand}} against was this pathetic, clinging, frightened child. And, not knowing very clearly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> murmured: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, he {{lost his}} temper; I would rather not repeat <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when <b>he</b> was mad with jealousy. There {{was nothing to be}} done with him but to give him his way." ...|$|R
60|$|Barbison {{looked hard}} at the man, and saw <b>he</b> meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Then <b>he</b> pulled up a floor-plate {{and looked at the}} filthy mass of coagulated grease that had drained from the engine-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{often had}} a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> {{followed}} {{me to my}} room, however, that night with a very grave face.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{the wrong}} type of man," [...] Graveling broke in sarcastically. [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> was heard {{to say it}} to the Home Secretary. The wrong type of man he called us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl, slowly and thoughtfully, [...] "I haven't. I wanted to, at fust; and then, I {{thought that if}} he truly meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would be willing to}} wait." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not happy}} at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> was filled with disgust at himself. He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice.|$|R
60|$|That is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said--and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed; and {{not only}} believed, but felt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not begin," [...] I suggested, [...] "by {{writing down}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> when <b>he</b> gave us our journals? Those wise words of advice {{will be in}} their proper place {{on the first page}} of the new books." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cheek,' {{repeated}} Riderhood, with {{an angry}} oath; 'cheek is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> can't say nothing but cheek. I'd ha' liked to plump down aboard of him, neck and crop, {{with a heavy}} jump, and sunk him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{tried to}} control himself. Hardly knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> made commonplace excuses, {{as if he had}} been a stranger: [...] "I am sorry to have startled you; I had no idea of finding you in this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Angry with you! Not in the least. I'll {{tell you}} just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he should}} not wish to live even with you, but that he would sooner try it with you than with any man he ever knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! I don't think so. I didn't take {{particular}} {{notice of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> because <b>he</b> {{was a bit}} squiffy. I believe he mentioned some thing about a business appointment that night, but I really didn't take much notice." ...|$|R
60|$|Clarke {{saw that}} it was not an idle threat. The American meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>he</b> hurriedly put a few things {{together}} and made them into a pack. Then he turned to Harding with a gesture of ironical resignation.|$|R
60|$|He never, by any chance, quite {{kept his}} word, {{though there was}} a moment in every case when he seemed to imagine doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>he</b> took with mute {{patience}} the rakings which the ladies gave him when he disappointed them.|$|R
60|$|Hearing {{these words}} {{from which he}} presaged the very worst, Kaku beat his head upon the ground, {{babbling}} denials of this awful crime, {{and at the same}} time began to implore pardon for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had not committed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, tell me <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> said, that if I died--what then? You {{must not}} be afraid of {{speaking}} of it openly. Why, Margaret, they have all {{told me that it}} must be in a month or two. What did Rubb say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As many as {{this bag}} will hold,' replied Peronnik, opening, as he spoke, the bag {{which he had}} filled with {{feathers}} and glue; and to prove <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> {{turned his back on}} the lion and began to imitate the song of a lark.|$|E
6000|$|... "In the book, yes. The fellow I {{gave the}} story to said it would never do not to have him marry her, and it would help to {{disguise}} the fact. That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after <b>he</b> had given the whole thing away." ...|$|R
