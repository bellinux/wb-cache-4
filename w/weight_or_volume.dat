25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum <b>weight</b> <b>or</b> <b>volume,</b> but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

40|$|Over {{recent years}} a vocal lobby has been campaigning against {{what they call}} the ‘bin tax’. Their {{argument}} {{is that this is a}} form of double taxation and as such is not fair and should be scrapped. Indeed they claim that this is another ‘stealth tax’, which has increased the tax burden while not improving services. Instead, waste collection services should be funded out of general taxation. On the other hand, there has been a move towards a more market-orientated system of waste collection with local authorities outsourcing the service or fully privatising it to licensed operators. These developments have also led to changes in the nature of the charges towards <b>weights</b> <b>or</b> <b>volume</b> base charges. This means that in contrast to general taxation or flat charges householders are now able to reduce their waste charges through more environmentally friendly behaviour. 1...|$|R

40|$|Although {{photochemical}} {{air pollutants}} {{are believed to}} be associated with respiratory illness, there is also a need to consider their possible effects on postnatal lung maturation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the maturation of lungs of young beagle dogs might be altered by an inhalation exposure to ozone that represents a severe 5 -d episode of photochemical oxidant air pollution. Exposures were at 6 wk of age to purified air, 1 or 2 ppm ozone for 4 hid on 5 consecutive days. After holding for 6 wk in clean air, lungs were removed and weighed, and the left lung was fixed both by inflation at 30 cm pressure and immersion using buffered formalin. Histologic sections were used for morphometric measurements. Statistical analysis showed that the mean linear intercept (inversely related to lung surface area) was greater than controls (up to about 5 %) in the 7 ppm ozone-exposed group. This effect was not seen at 2 ppm ozone, apparently due to large variations in mean linear intercept. No significant differences were seen in body weight, chest girth, lung <b>weight,</b> <b>or</b> <b>volumes</b> of the fixed, inflated lungs. It is concluded that if anatomic maturation of the lung was retarded by this brief regimen of ozone exposure, the effect was small and not likely to have major health consequences. © 1986 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation...|$|R
