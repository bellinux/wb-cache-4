5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E
25|$|Water, {{along with}} grassy vegetation, is another major {{component}} of the Przewalski horse's diet. A study, conducted by K.M. Scheibe {{and a team of}} scientists, documented the water consumption of 12 female Przewalski horses that were living in a semireserve over a course of 17 months. Their results show that, on average, a Przewalski horse drinks between 2.4 and 8.3 liters of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> which is less than the amount of water a domestic horse drinks daily. In fact, the Przewalski horse that consumed the most water in the study drank on average 8.6 liters of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> This almost equals the lowest amount of water consumption for a domestic horse which is 8.4 liters a day.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{essential}} for life. The amount of drinking water required is variable. It depends on physical activity, age, health issues, and environmental conditions. It is estimated that the average American drinks about one litre of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> with 95% drinking less than three litres per day. For those working in a hot climate, up to 16 liters a day may be required. Water makes up about 60% of weight in men and 55% of weight in women. Infants are about 70% to 80% water while the elderly are around 45%.|$|E

The right tee of the canal terminates at pumping station #3 on what was 8th street in Mossville, now the Sasol complex, providing 46,080,000 gallons of river water for a total daily contract use of 141,166,000 gallons of river <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rats only {{require an}} ounce (28 grams) {{of food and}} <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to live.

In particular, the city's rats adapt to practices and habits among New Yorkers for disposing of food waste. Curbside overnight garbage disposal from residences, stores, subway and restaurants, as well as littering, contribute to the sustenance of the city's rats. Rats almost always use the same routes to their food sources. Rat infestations have increased {{as a result of}} budget reductions and more wasteful disposal of food.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday 13 June the Field Ambulance {{packed up}} and moved onto the Jerusalem road at about 18:00 {{travelling}} on the very steep up-hill road till 23:00; on the way picking up four patients. They rested till 01.30 on Friday, before going on to arrive at Jerusalem, about 06:00, then on to Bethlehem, and two miles beyond, reached Solomon's Pools by 09:00. Here the three huge rock-lined reservoirs, built by King Solomon about 970 BC to supply water by aqueducts to Jerusalem, were still in reasonable repair as were the aqueducts which were still supplying about 40,000 gallons of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|For {{the nearly}} two decades of Napoleon III's reign, and for a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an {{enormous}} construction site. To bring fresh water to the city, his hydraulic engineer, Eugène Belgrand, built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the Vanne River in Champagne, and a new huge reservoir near the future Parc Montsouris. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic metres of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> He laid hundreds of kilometres of pipes to distribute the water throughout the city, and built a second network, using the less-clean water from the Ourq and the Seine, to wash the streets and water the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the Paris sewers, and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new streetlights along the Paris streets.|$|E

25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> that is used to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I {{constructed}} many lakes to {{meet the}} town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river Kaveri provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river. Bangalore receives 800 millionlitres (211 millionUS gallons) of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> {{more than any other}} Indian city. However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during summer- more so in the years of low rainfall. A random sampling study of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of twenty stations within the city indicated scores that ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of traffic concentration.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses of <b>water</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> is linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E

In Andalusia, till a few years ago, there were practically no high roads, and even now they are few and bad.
