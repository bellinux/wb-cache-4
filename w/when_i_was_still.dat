500|$|Ramsey {{made his}} full League debut on 26 October 1946, in a Second Division match against Plymouth Argyle at the Dell, {{replacing}} the injured regular right-back Bill Ellerington. The nervous Ramsey was helped through the match by the calm reassurance and {{guidance of the}} experienced Southampton captain Bill Rochford, the team's other full-back. Southampton won 5–1, their joint-biggest win of the 1946–47 season, but Ramsey found {{the pace of the}} regular peacetime Football League a drastic step up. [...] "Their reactions to moves were so speedy they had completed a pass, for instance, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> thinking things over", he later wrote. After one more game, Ellerington was reinstated and Ramsey went back to the reserves. Ramsey was kept out of the first team until January 1947, when Ellerington was injured again shortly before an away match at Newcastle United. Southampton lost 3–1, but Ramsey was generally considered to have acquitted himself well. He kept his place {{for the rest of the}} season, gradually growing in confidence. Dodgin praised Ramsey in a February 1947 interview as a [...] "player who thinks football, talks football and lives football".|$|E

Macedonski commended his new protégé for reaching [...] "the summit of poetry and art" [...] at [...] "an age <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> prattling verses". Liga Ortodoxă also hosted articles against Caragiale, which Macedonski signed with the pseudonym Sallustiu ("Sallustius"). The magazine was additional proof of Macedonski's return to conservatism, and largely dedicated to defending the cause of Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Ghenadie, deposed by the Romanian Synod following a political scandal. It defended Ghenadie up until he chose to resign, and subsequently went out of print. Macedonski was shocked to note that Ghenadie had given up his own defense.|$|E

40|$|Noble gas {{analyses}} for the inclusions and hosts from Yamato (Y) - 75097,Y- 793241 and Y- 794046 have been performed. The concordant exposure ages {{as well as}} gas retention ages are observed between the host and the inclusion of each meteorite. These indicate that both experienced the same heating event and exposure history. High ^ Xe/^ Xe ratios (≅ 50) and neutron induced ^ Kr, ^ Kr and ^ Xe are due to very low concentrations of trapped noble gases in the inclusions from Y- 75097 and Y- 793241. This indicates a close genetic relationship and an early crystallization <b>when</b> ^ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. The inclusion of Y- 794046,however, has a noble gas signature which {{is quite different from}} the other ones, suggesting a different origin.
