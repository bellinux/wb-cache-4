5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the other end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the other end. This brought up England's 100, its first <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|The {{achievement}} of {{a convoy of}} merchants not only escaping <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> from a French squadron, but {{going so far as}} to attack, drive off, and then pursue their would-be predators, was widely hailed as a signal victory.|$|E
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and Barnes {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E

In the Irani Trophy, the traditional season opener between the reigning Ranji champions—Mumbai—and the Rest of India, Kartik orchestrated the demise of the title-holders. After taking 4/73 in Mumbai's 260, Kartik scored 22 in the Rest of India's 389. He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory <b>without</b> <b>loss.</b> Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against Madhya Pradesh to secure his spot in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron was {{immediately}} put on alert. At noon, Pattle {{was ordered to}} fly a fighter patrol over the Rupel Pass, Bulgaria, another Axis partner.

The {{next day}} they attacked the Japanese airfield at Vila, Solomon Islands after it had been bombarded by four Allied light cruisers. The aircraft returned to the carrier <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> later that afternoon. Captain Bogan slipped and badly injured himself on 29 March so Captain Henry M. Mullinnix assumed command on 7 April.|$|E
5|$|The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 {{to support}} {{operations}} of the Japanese Army in China. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to have shot down six <b>without</b> <b>loss.</b> The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> to themselves. The carriers returned to Sasebo {{at the beginning of}} September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Canton. Nine fighters from Ryūjō escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking. Ryūjō returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral Tomoshige Samejima's Second Carrier Division.|$|E

5|$|The Take Ichi convoy was {{assembled}} at Shanghai in April 1944. Its {{task was}} to carry the 32nd Division to Mindanao and {{the main body of}} the 35th Division to western New Guinea. Both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France <b>without</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

40|$|Far-field spot {{compression}} <b>without</b> energy <b>loss</b> in main lob is {{of great}} significance to wireless laser communication. In this letter, we propose two schemes to obtain far-field spot compression <b>without</b> energy <b>loss</b> in main lob. One scheme {{is based on the}} simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Using SA algorithm, we design the phase profile of the diffractive phase element (DPE). Using the designed DPE, far-field spot compression <b>without</b> energy <b>loss</b> in main lob is achieved. The other scheme is based on YG algorithm. By means of YG algorithm, we appropriately designed the DPE in the emitting plane. Using the DPE, far-field spot compression <b>without</b> energy <b>loss</b> in main lob is obtained. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, <b>without</b> <b>loss</b> to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E
