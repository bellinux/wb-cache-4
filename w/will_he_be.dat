25|$|In the Philippines, amulets {{are called}} agimat or anting-anting. According to folklore, the most {{powerful}} anting-anting is the hiyas ng saging (directly translated as pearl or gem of the banana). The hiyas must come from a mature banana and only comes out during midnight. Before the person can fully possess this agimat, he must fight a supernatural creature called kapre. Only then <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> its true owner. During Holy Week, devotees travel to Mount Banahaw to recharge their amulets.|$|E
25|$|Hafeez was {{originally}} suspended from bowling in November 2014. Following remedial {{work on his}} bowling action, he was reassessed and permitted to resume bowling in April 2015. As this report has constituted the player’s second report within a two-year period, {{the first of which}} led to a suspension, he is now automatically suspended from bowling in international cricket for a 12-month period. Hafeez is entitled to appeal any procedural aspect of an independent assessment that has led to this automatic suspension. However, only after the expiry of this one-year period <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> entitled to approach the ICC for a re-assessment of his bowling action.|$|E
25|$|The {{constraints}} adopted have definite implications on {{the stories}} told. An Earthman may {{fall in love}} with and wed an alien princess like Burroughs' John Carter of Mars does, but unlike Carter {{will never be able to}} found a dynasty. Nor <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> able to flit from Earth to the stars and back; an interstellar voyage takes months of subjective time and many years in objective time - as dictated by the time dilation of the Theory of relativity - rendering any decision to leave his own stellar system a difficult one, fraught with the consequences of being cut off from his friends, family and native culture for decades, during which they will age or develop much more than he will himself. De Camp somewhat mitigates the problem by postulating the development of longevity treatments that extend human lifespans to two centuries. Nonetheless, the effect is that space travel primarily attracts marginal and unattached members of society such as adventurers, entrepreneurs, con-men, utopian idealists, emigrants, and various admixtures thereof – or official representatives such as explorers, diplomats, and bureaucrats. Sterling, selfless heroes are in short supply.|$|E

The more the two, in their different aspects, find a proper unity in the one reality of love, the more {{the true nature of}} love in general is realized... On the other hand, man cannot live by oblative, descending love alone. He cannot always give, he must also receive. Anyone who wishes to give love must also receive love as a gift... Yet to become such a source, one must constantly drink anew from the original source, which is Jesus Christ, from whose pierced heart flows the love of God... Only in the way of contemplation <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> able to take upon himself the needs of others and make them his own. (§7) ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the Middle Ages, the Christian {{understanding}} of slavery {{has been subjected}} to significant internal conflict and has endured dramatic change. Nearly all Christian leaders before the late 17th century recognised slavery, within specific biblical limitations, as consistent with Christian theology. The key verse used to justify slavery was Genesis 9:25-27: [...] "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> to his brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem." [...] which was interpreted to mean that Africans were the descendants of Ham, cursed with [...] "the mark of Ham" [...] to be servants to the descendants of Japheth (Europeans) and Shem (Asians). In early Medieval times, the Church discouraged slavery throughout Europe, largely eliminating it. That changed in 1452, when Pope Nicholas V instituted the hereditary slavery of captured Muslims and pagans, regarding all non-Christians as [...] "enemies of Christ." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} protection for people's health {{has been the}} National Health Service, founded by the NHS Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to {{health care in the}} UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a [...] "frolic of his own", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer <b>will</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, breach of a statutory duty is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting {{for them in the}} [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules.
