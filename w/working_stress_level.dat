The model design allows necessary yaw angle capability, the required pitching motion, mass flow control through the duct, and variation of heat exchanger mass flow. Modular concept has been fully used in the, model design so as to obtain all the configurations of the model easily. Basic structural analysis making-use of strength materials approach was carried out for all the newly designed components, since the model makes use of many components of a model tested in an earlier campaign.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>working</b> mothers' <b>stress</b> <b>level</b> and two child characteristics, gender and temperament, in addition to the daily routines of the mothers, in an attempt to ascertain why <b>working</b> mothers are <b>stressed.</b> Studies of maternal employment have demonstrated that working mothers are exposed to the numerous, often conflicting roles of being a wife, a mother, and an employee (Apter, 1993, Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985; LeMesurier, 1995). These opposing roles usually result in role conflict or role overload, which in turn leads to stress (Greenhaus Br: Parasuraman, 1986). The reasons for the increased <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> of <b>working</b> mothers, however have not been clearly identified. Gender and child temperament are two factors that may be linked to the <b>stress</b> <b>working</b> mother experiences (Alvarez, 1985; Hoffman, 1984). Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that it is possible that certain daily rituals of a working mother with a child in day care may be related to the elevated <b>stress</b> <b>levels</b> (LeMesurier, 1995). Fifty-seven parents of three-to five-year-old children in community and corporate day care centres in the greater metropolitan Montreal and Toronto areas participated in this study.

40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of critical NASA space flight hardware is ensured through a damage tolerance program which is dictated in the fracture control requirements. The {{goal of a}} fracture control program is to ensure proper material selection and control, control of <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> <b>levels,</b> use of fracture resistant design concepts, manufacturing process control, {{and the use of}} qualified inspection procedures. The damage tolerance philosophy assumes that all components contain initial defects and the damage accumulation process is thus entirely crack propagation. The service capability of fracture critical components is determined by analysis and/or test. A large percentage of NASA fracture critical hardware is certified by analysis only and it is therefore imperative that the analysis code utilized contain the latest state of the art technology. Not all space contractors and vendors are able to develop and maintain an analysis code which meets this requirement. A response to this need has been fulfilled by the development of the NASA/FLAGRO (NASGRO) fracture mechanics code here at the Johnson Space Center. The NASGRO code is based primarily in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and is continually updated to meet to needs of the user community. Development assistance comes from other NASA centers as well as the European Space Agency (ESA). The code currently has a vast materials data file (over 350 different entries) which defines the material strength, fracture toughness, crack growth rate, and crack growth threshold. The code also allows for user defined inputs of data from other sources. The code also provides a large library of stress intensity factor solutions for numerous geometries and loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to report}} {{theoretically}} the possible approach of confinement evaluation of unbound granular base course using the {{finite element method}} and the permanent deformation evaluation of crushed rock under repeated cyclic loading triaxial tests performed at different stress levels in order to implement current pavement material test algorithm. Road rutting is the main cause of damage in flexible pavements which the most explanation is crushed rock still not obviously understanding about plastic deformation under service load. The permanent deformation that accumulates under the repeated loading can normally describe and define the types of responses. Theoretical approach of the unbound granular materials (UGMs) permanent deformation used to describe the behaviour of tested materials subject to repeated loading triaxial (RLT) tests by macro-mechanical observations of the UGMs response. The plastic limit is able to use predict the accumulated plastic deformation in the UGMs layer of road pavement or whether deterioration will be unacceptable. Tested material will determine the limit of <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> <b>level</b> and the plastic deformation should be considered in this behaviour. As is well known, triaxial and California bearing ratio (CBR) test are used to simulate the real condition of pavement materials under traffic loads by using static confinement and actuator loads. However static confining conditions in pavement structure occur only when no vehicle travels. As the effects of traffic loads and material attributes are generated when vehicles travel, horizontal stress and confinement behaviours of pavement structure were determined. CBR sample of crushed rock base was modelled using finite element in order to study the confining pressure behaviour of such material subjected to applied stress. During the load application procedure, a single wheel with a standard pressure of 750 kPa was selected to compare with the analysed strength of crushed rock base (CRB) based on laboratory test results. The results showed that horizontal stress of base course layer consists of overburdened soil and passive force from applied stress. When vehicle travels pass observed point, horizontal pressures of base course layer increase from overburdened weight and complete with passive force effect depend on applied stress and its internal friction. Seemingly, the conventional triaxial test results with finite element back calculation are able to describe the confining behaviour of unbound granular base course. In this study, triaxial tests and the confinement evaluation using finite element approach on an unbound granular base course were introduced to explain and define its limited use in order to implement the current performance test of unbound granular base course material...|$|E

Objectives: The objective {{of this study is to}} study the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on cardiorespiratory efficiency and autonomic functions in over weight and obese <b>working</b> <b>stressed</b> postmenopausal females. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 postmenopausal overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI]: 24. 97 Â± 1. 28) females belonging to the age group 50 - 55 years were included. <b>Stress</b> <b>level</b> in the subjects was assessed according to the presumptive life event stress scale. The perceived stress scale (PSS) of Sheldon Cohen was used for measuring the perception of stress. Fasting blood samples were collected to exclude diabetic subjects and analyze lipid profile. BMI and waist/hip ratio were calculated. Resting pulse rate and blood pressure, respiratory rate were measured. VO 2 max, physical fitness index, breath holding time and 40 mm endurance test time were calculated for estimation of cardiopulmonary efficiency. Autonomic function tests were carried. Subjects were given progressive muscle relaxation training for 3 months and all parameters were reevaluated. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Results: PSS in pre-training session was 26. 16 Â± 1. 7 and in post-training session was 14. 33 Â± 2. 01 and the difference was statistically significant. There was a significant decrease in pulse rate, blood pressure, BMI, waist/hip ratio, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein following preventive medicine residency training.
