5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications of taking a defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the Donbass, rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, Pope {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} from Washington to the field. He was informed by Halleck {{of the plan}} to link up with McClellan's army, but rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> to occur, he moved some of his forces to a position near Cedar Mountain, from whence he could launch cavalry raids on Gordonsville. Jackson advanced to Culpeper Court House on August 7, hoping to attack one of Pope's corps {{before the rest of}} the army could be concentrated.|$|E

After the Virginia Tech shootings, Boortz criticized the media, saying, [...] "When {{the history of}} this event is written, we will have 25 {{students}} standing meekly <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> guy to execute them." [...] When public outrage resulted from his comments, members of the Virginia Legislature tried to have Boortz's show removed from local radio stations. In March 2008, Boortz attracted controversy by playing an audiotape of a nine-year-old where he repeatedly ridiculed the child’s speech, leading to an unsuccessful FCC petition to deny Boortz’s employer the right to purchase five local radio stations.|$|E

Bradshaw did praise the power dynamics around Victoria, but concluded [...] "I spent an hour and three-quarters <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> film to start.

[...] Her personality has evolved over the past few seasons from depressed, to happy and [...] "fixed". Pompeo said to Good Morning America, [...] "I am so incredibly lucky to have Patrick , to have the chemistry that we do, we have an amazing relationship, and it's like any other relationship, you have your ups and downs.

500|$|The BX {{arrived in}} South Fort George on June 24, to {{a warm welcome}} from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local {{residents}} had been anticipating {{the day of the}} BX's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. [...] The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it would be to have the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George.|$|E
2500|$|Goodfellas {{is based}} on New York crime {{reporter}} Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. Martin Scorsese {{did not intend to}} make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: [...] "To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's {{the only way you can}} really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it." [...] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, [...] "I've been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> book my entire life", to which Pileggi replied, [...] "I've been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> phone call my entire life".|$|E

[...] "The evidence I’ve seen indicates that the Russian Army was sitting there <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> that this was essentially a provocation launched by the South Ossetians, who ratcheted up {{the level of violence}} in order to bring the Georgians -- who are easily provokable, obviously -- to attack," [...] he said.

2500|$|In [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] (2013), the Time Lords {{reach out}} to the {{universe}} through a crack in time on the planet Trenzalore, broadcasting the message [...] "Doctor who?" [...] through time and space to draw the Doctor in. They also send through a truth field so that when the Doctor arrives he will say his real name, with the field making sure it's the real one, which will be a signal for them to return. As [...] "half the universe" [...] are at Trenzalore <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> the Eleventh Doctor refuses as it will restart the Time War. When a very old and frail Doctor goes to meet his demise {{at the hands of the}} Daleks, Clara Oswald begs the Time Lords through the crack to intervene, and the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle through the crack before closing it, changing the Doctor's future and allowing him to defeat the Daleks and save Trenzalore.|$|E

She played her first match of her comeback on April 26 at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, a tournament that she had previously won on three occasions. Her first round opponent was Italian Roberta Vinci, who she went on to defeat in straight sets to advance to the second round, making it her first victory since her return. In her on-court interview Sharapova said, [...] "The first few seconds before you enter the arena – it's been a stage of mine since I was a young girl – I've been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> moment for a long time." [...] She followed it up with another straight sets victory over countrywoman Ekaterina Makarova in the second round. In the quarterfinals, she defeated qualifier Anett Kontaveit in straight sets, before losing to Kristina Mladenovic in the semifinals.|$|E
