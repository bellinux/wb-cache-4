Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' War {{had left it}} <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> {{commitments}} in the Americas {{that had to be}} paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E
5|$|President James A. Garfield died {{four days}} before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a {{courtesy}} call to newly inaugurated President Chester A. Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1938–39, Verity toured South Africa with the MCC team under Hammond's captaincy. He took 47wickets at 19.93 in {{first-class}} games. In {{the first game of}} the tour, Verity took 11 wickets against Griqualand West. In the Test matches, the batsmen played in a negative fashion, despite pitches that were very good for batting. High scoring games left the bowlers <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> figures and Verity had the best bowling average on either side, bowling accurately and reliably. He played in all five Test matches, taking 19wickets at 29.05. The first two matches were drawn: in the first innings of the opening Test, he took four for 61 in 44 eight-ball overs; in the first innings of the second Test, he took five for 70 in nearly 37overs. England won the third match, the only result in the series and the fourth was also drawn. The final game was to be played without a time limit until there was a winner; after 10 days it had to be abandoned as the MCC had to catch a boat home. The match established a record at the time for the total number of runs scored in a first-class game, as both teams combined to post an aggregate of 1,981 runs. Verity took four wickets and bowled 766 balls in the game, establishing a new record for deliveries in a first-class game. It proved difficult to score runs from Verity's bowling but the batsmen generally were very cautious.|$|E

25|$|Gregory also {{concerned}} himself with establishing or restoring monasteries. He turned his family mansion in Rome into a monastery, St. Agatha in Suburra, endowing it <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> and precious vessels for {{use at the}} altar, and also established a new church, dedicated to Sant'Eustachio. In 718 he restored Monte Cassino, which had not recovered from an attack by the Lombards in 584, and he intervened in a dispute at the Monastery of St. Vincent on the Volturno over the deposition of the abbot.|$|E
25|$|The main change, and {{the most}} radical among the CANDU generations, {{is the use of}} {{pressurized}} light water as the coolant. This significantly reduces the cost of implementing the primary cooling loop, which no longer has to be filled <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> heavy water. The ACR-1000 uses about 1/3rd the heavy water needed in earlier generation designs. It also eliminates tritium production in the coolant loop, the major source of tritium leaks in operational CANDU designs. The redesign also allows for a slightly negative void reactivity, a major design goal of all Gen III+ machines.|$|E
40|$|Deviations from put-call parity contain {{information}} about future returns. We use {{the difference in}} implied volatility between pairs of call and put options to measure these deviations and find that stocks <b>with</b> relatively <b>expensive</b> calls outperform stocks <b>with</b> relatively <b>expensive</b> puts by at least 45 basis points per week. We find both positive abnormal performance in stocks <b>with</b> relatively <b>expensive</b> calls and negative abnormal performance in stocks <b>with</b> relatively <b>expensive</b> puts, a result which cannot be explained by short sales constraints. Using data on rebate rates from the stock lending market, we confirm directly that our findings are not driven by stocks {{that are hard to}} borrow. Controlling for size, deviations from put-call parity are more likely to occur in options with underlying stocks that face more information risk. Deviations from put-call parity also tend to predict returns to a larger extent in firms that face a more asymmetric information environment, and in firms with high residual analyst coverage. Taken together, the results indicate that the demand for an option can affect its price for information- rather than only friction-based reasons. We also find that the degree of predictability decreases considerably over the sample period. Our results are consistent with mispricing during the earlier years of the study, with a gradual elimination of the mispricing over time...|$|R

25|$|Jenny's first {{marriage}} {{was to her}} dancing partner Harry Fox in 1912. They too divorced in 1921. In 1925, the sisters met retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge while they were performing in London. Jenny began an affair with Selfridge (Rosie also reportedly {{had an affair with}} him). Selfridge lavished Jenny <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> gifts and funded both sisters' gambling habit. The Dolly Sisters reportedly gambled approximately $4 million of Selfridge's money away. While she was still involved with Selfridge, Jenny Dolly began seeing French pilot Max Constant. In 1933, Selfridge offered Jenny $10 million to marry him.|$|E
25|$|THH had {{periods of}} {{depression}} {{at the end}} of 1871, alleviated by a cruise to Egypt. And again in 1873, this time coincident <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> building work on his house. His friends were really alarmed, and his doctor ordered three months rest. Darwin picked up his pen, and with Tyndall's help raised £2,100 for him — an enormous sum. The money was partly to pay for his recuperation, and partly to pay his bills. Huxley set out in July with Hooker to the Auvergne, and his wife and son Leonard joined him in Cologne, while the younger children stayed at Down House in Emma Darwin's care.|$|E
25|$|A {{hub-and-spoke}} network has been operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory since 2011. All messages are routed via the hub. The system equips each node {{in the network}} with quantum transmitters—i.e., lasers—but not <b>with</b> <b>expensive</b> and bulky photon detectors. Only the hub receives quantum messages. To communicate, each node sends a one-time pad to the hub, which it then uses to communicate securely over a classical link. The hub can route this message to another node using another one time pad from the second node. The entire network is secure only if the central hub is secure. Individual nodes require {{little more than a}} laser: Prototype nodes are around the size of a box of matches.|$|E
