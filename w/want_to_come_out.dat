So after release we have tons of new quests we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with, we're going to be adding new factions to the game to help liven things up further, we have a ton of new map styles {{we want to put}} in - all kinds of crazy new stuff we can put in here.|$|E
500|$|Rumble {{organised}} {{a band of}} his friends, {{rather than}} the standard practice of contracting out to professional studio musicians. Scott Nicholls played drums, Ben White played guitar, Alistair Wood played keyboard instruments and Rumble's brother Josh played bass. White and Wood had previously played music with Fast Crew. The band spent three months recording the album's music; drums were recorded at York Street Studio, Auckland, while {{the remainder of the}} recording took place at Beaver Studios, Auckland. Rumble co-produced The Experiment with Jonathan Campbell, who also engineered the record. Rumble said he put {{a lot of time and}} effort into the album; [...] "I really wanted to write a world class record, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with some half-pie thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes you do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience and I guess you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E
500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said {{that she did not}} intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you actually felt it." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another account arises {{out of the}} 1889 pennant race. [...] That year, Bennett {{played for}} the Boston Beaneaters in a close pennant race with the New York Giants. Bennett's hands had taken a beating while {{catching}} for John Clarkson, who won 49 games and pitched five games a week during the season. [...] On {{the last day of}} the season, Boston had to win, and New York had to lose for Boston to finish in first place. By the sixth inning, second baseman Hardy Richardson told the manager, Jim Hart, that the ball was coming to him in a bloody state due to the condition of Bennett's hands. [...] Bennett did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the game, but Hart removed him over Bennett's protest, and Bennett [...] "had to keep his hands in plasters for two weeks." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

60|$|A brown, decayed, old town, Piacenza is. A deserted, solitary, grass-grown place, with ruined ramparts; half filled-up trenches, which {{afford a}} frowsy {{pasturage}} to the lean kine that wander about them; and streets of stern houses, moodily frowning {{at the other}} houses over the way. The sleepiest and shabbiest of soldiery go wandering about, with the double curse of laziness and poverty, uncouthly wrinkling their misfitting regimentals; the dirtiest of children play with their impromptu toys (pigs and mud) in the feeblest of gutters; and the gauntest of dogs trot {{in and out of}} the dullest of archways, in perpetual search of something to eat, which they never seem to find. A mysterious and solemn Palace, guarded by two colossal statues, twin Genii of the place, stands gravely in the midst of the idle town; and the king with the marble legs, who flourished in the time of the thousand and one Nights, might live contentedly inside of it, and never have the energy, in his upper half of flesh and blood, to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
