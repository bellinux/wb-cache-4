Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the <b>way</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply made him want to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E

500|$|Like Kitana and Jade, Mileena was {{originally}} portrayed by Katalin Zamiar in Mortal Kombat II, who was using her own sai. A false rumor printed in Game Informer {{told of a}} Mileena-like secret character named Emerald supposedly hidden in the game. After MKII, Mileena was officially declared by Tobias and Boon to be [...] "gone" [...] and not returning, yet was brought back due to popular demand, with Becky Gable taking over the role in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Mileena's main color has been either a shade of purple or magenta in various installments (including when masquerading as Kitana in Deception) and their outfits {{did not differ in}} a significant <b>way</b> (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> just having different color patterns) until Mortal Kombat Gold. Since then, her costumes have been generally getting more skimpy with every new game, including always having an exposed midriff since Deception. Mileena's main costume in Deception and Armageddon is actually mostly black and features long flowing arm sleeves, a back-only loincloth and a partially transparent veil. Her motion capture actor in these games was Carlos Pesina. In Shaolin Monks, Mileena appears half-naked (her costume made largely of just belts of leather and scraps of fabric), barefoot (with a bandaged midfoot), and again wearing a veil in place of a mask (the veil also returns as part of her formal outfit in Mortal Kombat 2011). In the 2011 reboot game, her prime costume is based on her famous provocative alternate from Deception, but more detailed and again featuring a mask. In all, in this game she has the largest number of costumes out of all characters in the entire series. Her [...] "Flesh Pit" [...] alternate costume in the 2011 game is made of just some loose bandages put around her otherwise completely naked body, marking the first time that she has appeared unmasked by default. In this game, her motion capture actress was a woman. [...] "The Ultimate Horror Pack" [...] DLC for Mortal Kombat X included the Vampiress Mileena.|$|E

2500|$|Vaughan {{owned and}} {{used a variety of}} guitars during his career. His guitar of choice, and the {{instrument}} that he became most associated with, was the Fender Stratocaster, his favorite being a 1963 body, with a 1962 neck, and pickups dated from 1959. This is why Vaughan usually referred to his Stratocaster as a, [...] "1959 Strat." [...] He explained why he favored this guitar in a 1983 interview: [...] "I like the strength of its sound. Any guitar I play has got to be pretty versatile. It's got a big, strong tone and it'll take anything I do to it." [...] Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his [...] "first wife," [...] or, [...] "Number One." [...] Another favourite guitar, was a slightly later Strat he named 'Lenny' after his wife, Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar, a 1965 Stratocaster that had been refinished in red, with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking $300 for it, which was <b>way</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar, so she got six of their friends to chip in $50 each, and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night, after bringing [...] "Lenny" [...] (the guitar, and wife) home with him, he wrote the song, [...] "Lenny." [...] He started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings, although he did play other guitars, including custom guitars.|$|E
