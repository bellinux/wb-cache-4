5|$|An {{example of}} Como's {{popularity}} came in 1956, <b>when</b> <b>Life</b> conducted {{a poll of}} young women, asking them which man in public life most fit the concept of their ideal husband: it was Perry Como. A 1958 nationwide poll of U.S. teenagers found Perry Como {{to be the most}} popular male singer, beating Elvis Presley, who was the winner of the previous year's poll. At one point, his television show was broadcast in at least 12 other countries.|$|E

25|$|Abortion: Badnarik {{personally}} opposes abortion, but {{believes that}} decisions regarding abortion rights {{should be made}} {{at the state and}} not the federal level.

25|$|By comparison, Earth's present global {{equilibrium}} temperature is 255 K (−18°C), which is raised to 288 K (15°C) by greenhouse effects. However, <b>when</b> <b>life</b> evolved early in Earth's history, the Sun's energy output {{is thought to}} have been only about 75% of its current value, which would have correspondingly lowered Earth's {{equilibrium temperature}} under the same albedo conditions. Yet Earth maintained equable temperatures in that era, perhaps with a more intense greenhouse effect, or a lower albedo, than at present.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, abortion, {{along with}} infanticide, was {{considered}} {{in the context of}} family planning, gender selection, population control, and the property rights of the patriarch. Rarely were the rights of the prospective mother, much less the prospective child, taken into consideration. Although generally legal, the morality of abortion, birth control and child abandonment (as a form of infanticide) was sometimes discussed. Then, as now, these discussions often concerned the nature of man, the existence of a soul, <b>when</b> <b>life</b> begins, and the beginning of human personhood.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} opinions among Islamic scholars about <b>when</b> <b>life</b> begins, and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a fetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible. Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.|$|E

A few, indeed, in the centre, whom the praetorian cohort had scattered, lay a little apart from the rest, but the wounds even of these were in front.

25|$|Those with {{damage to}} {{regions of the}} brain {{involved}} in visual processing, such as the occipital lobes, may develop amnesia. The episodic content of autobiographical memories is predominantly encoded {{in the form of}} visual images. If the ability to generate visual images is compromised or lost then access to specific details of the past held in episodic images is lost as well. <b>When</b> <b>life</b> events or episodic memories are encoded in the brain, they are in the form of pictures or visual images. They develop amnesia since they can no longer bring these visual images of the past to mind.|$|E
25|$|While often {{delegated}} {{to the field}} of astrobiology, attempts to understand how and <b>when</b> <b>life</b> arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated “primordial soup”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the “RNA World” hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA and the idea that life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.|$|E

25|$|Cysteine {{residues}} {{in class}} III β-tubulin are {{actively involved in}} regulating ligand interactions and microtubule formation. Proteomic analysis has revealed that many factors bound to these cysteine residues {{are involved in the}} oxidative stress and glucose deprivation response. This is particularly interesting {{in light of the fact}} that class III β-tubulin first appears in the phylogenetic tree <b>when</b> <b>life</b> emerged from the seas and cells were exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In structural terms, constitutive Class I (TUBB) and Class IVb (TUBB2C) β-tubulins contain a cysteine at position 239, while βIII-tubulin has a cysteine at position 124. Position 239 can be readily oxidized while position 124 is relatively resistant to oxidation. Thus, a relative abundance of βIII-tubulin in situations of oxidative stress could provide a protective benefit.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Life</b> {{was founded}} in 1883, it was {{developed}} as similar to the British magazine, Punch.

During its later years, the magazine offered brief capsule reviews (similar to those in The New Yorker) of plays and movies currently running in New York City, but with the innovative touch of a colored typographic bullet resembling a traffic light, appended to each review: green for a positive review, red for a negative one, and amber for mixed notices.|$|E
