5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for the rider who had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. It could have been a rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> often.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{reveal that}} despite the {{repeated}} attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} before the war Bessie was concerned at the extent of recruitment in the city by the British Union of Fascists. She was outspoken in her attacks on fascist groups, and in her defence of those <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> their parades. The death of her mother Mary Bamber in June 1938, {{at the age of}} 63, was a considerable personal blow to Bessie, and was widely mourned within Liverpool's socialist community.|$|E

To {{have access to}} them, the player must input the famous Konami Code at the title screen. The characters {{are available in the}} special two-player mode found on this collection. The fighters are Bishoo (a woman dressed in white <b>who</b> <b>attacks</b> with daggers) and Clayman (a living statue <b>who</b> <b>attacks</b> with a sword bigger than Sword's). A hidden character in the mobile phone version is Katana, a samurai <b>who</b> <b>attacks</b> with a katana.|$|R

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one <b>who</b> <b>attacked.</b> According to this view, Beornwulf may {{have taken advantage of}} the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyad Caliphate had conquered Syria, Egypt, and North Africa {{from the}} {{predominantly}} Christian Byzantine Empire, and Hispania from the Visigothic Kingdom. In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed {{and a number}} of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the Aghlabids, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> Italy in the 9th century. Pisa, Genoa, and the Principality of Catalonia began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the Mediterranean Basin, exemplified by the Mahdia campaign and battles at Majorca and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Hill 875 had cost 2-503 87 killed, 130 wounded, and three missing. 4-503 {{suffered}} 28 killed 123 wounded, and four missing. Combined with noncombatant losses, this represented {{one-fifth of the}} 173rd Airborne Brigade's total strength. For its combined actions during operations around Dak To, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. 340 of the 570 173rd Airborne troops <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> the hill became casualties.|$|E

5|$|Voss was bequeathed an Albatros D.III in the squadron's insignia. During {{his brief}} spell with Jasta 5, Voss scored a further half dozen victories. However, {{he was not}} always successful; {{he was one of}} the three German fighters <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> and seriously damaged Captain Keith Caldwell of 60 Squadron on 28 May 1917, just after Voss's 31st victory, but the wily New Zealander escaped.|$|E
5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of {{negative}} newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was {{on the edge of a}} deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E

5|$|George Vernadsky {{proposed}} that Oleg of Novgorod was the donkey-riding {{chief of the}} Rus' <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> Bardha'a. Vernadsky identified Oleg with Helgu, a figure mentioned in the Schechter Letter. According to that document, Helgu went to Persia by boat and died there after a failed attack on Constantinople in 941. On the other hand, Lev Gumilev, drawing on {{the name of the}} Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was Sveneld, a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was noted in the Primary Chronicle under 945.|$|E
5|$|Isa Abdulhasan Ali Hussain was a 60-year-old Bahraini {{who died}} on 17 February morning {{immediately}} after riot police fired at his head from point-blank range. Hussain {{was a part of}} a group of protesters who marched back towards Pearl Roundabout after being dispersed when police shot him. Eyewitnesses say he went near security forces asking them to allow young people help the injured protesters. However, police claimed he was with a group of protesters <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> them using metal rods, swords, molotov cocktails, stones and other weapons. His funeral was held on 18February in Karzakan and was attended by thousands of mourners. An unnamed policeman charged with his murder was acquitted on 27 September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from {{anterograde}} amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The first Spanish {{contact with}} the Manche Ch'ol was in 1525, when an {{expedition}} led by Hernán Cortés crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted their concentration into mission towns and their conversion to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the Manche. The Manche Ch'ol in the mission towns were badly affected by disease, which also encouraged them to flee the towns.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained {{in defiance of the}} law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{deliberate}} attack by any group targeting the British Army, which had not established defences against any form of assault. During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found. In response to the attack, the British imposed a road curfew from 18:00 to 06:00 each night and all cafes, restaurants and public entertainment venues in Tel Aviv were closed between 20:00 and 05:00. However this was not enough for {{some members of the}} division, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants. Those involved were later punished by the British Army.|$|E
5|$|After a power struggle, Bolesław III Wrymouth (r. 1102–1138) {{became the}} duke of Poland by {{defeating}} his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106–1107. Zbigniew {{had to leave the}} country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> Bolesław's Poland in 1109. Bolesław was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see Battle of Głogów). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Bolesław's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father Władysław I Herman and completed by Bolesław around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to Rügen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Bolesław's fief, to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.|$|E
5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) to win the title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was given an opportunity to earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; {{all he had to do}} was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed to win the match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, <b>who</b> <b>attacked</b> him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline him for a few weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E
