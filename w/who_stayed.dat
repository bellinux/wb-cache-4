5|$|A {{slightly}} later route {{along the}} parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19thcentury, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> {{in the area}} developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|After years, Ulmo {{returned}} to Beleriand {{to seek out}} the remaining Teleri. As Elwë had not yet been found, a great part of the Teleri took his brother Olwë as their leader and were ferried to Valinor. Some Teleri stayed behind though, still looking for Elwë, and others stayed on the shores, being called by Ossë. They took Círdan as their leader and became the Falathrim. All Teleri <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> in Beleriand later became known as the Sindar.|$|E
5|$|Camp {{meetings}} at the Mountain Grove Campground was held for seven to ten days each August. Several thousand people would attend the camp each year. By 1878, campground attendance on Saturdays had reached 4000 to 5000 people. The percentage of attendees <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> for the whole duration of the camp meeting, as opposed to only part of it, also decreased during the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God {{told him not to}} do so.

5|$|Josquin did {{not stay}} in Ferrara long.

5|$|Before Juan made landfall, about 100 people {{evacuated}} around Port Arthur, Texas.

About 6,000 people evacuated in Mississippi due to the threat for flooding. Many schools were closed along the coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, and two beaches were closed {{both sides of the}} Brownsville, Texas shipping channel. On October 28, governor Edwin Edwards {{declared a state of emergency}} for 13 Louisiana parishes, while officials issued flash flood watches for 42 of Louisiana's 64 parishes.

5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} the 1947 {{season with a}} 12–1–1 win-loss-tie record and beat the New York Yankees to win its second straight AAFC championship. While the team was successful in those {{first two years of}} existence, head coach Paul Brown made numerous roster changes before the 1948 season. He brought in linebacker Alex Agase and defensive tackle Chubby Grigg via a trade with the Chicago Rockets. Tommy James, a defensive back <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> with the team through the 1955 season, came from the National Football League's Detroit Lions.

5|$|In 1906, Walter Law {{replaced}} the Briarcliff Manor railroad station {{and moved the}} original building to serve as Millwood's station. The new Briarcliff station, {{now part of the}} village library, was modeled in the style of his Briarcliff Lodge, and had Mission style furniture, rugs, and flowers decorating the interior. Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th-century millionaires <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area.

5|$|In December, both Erich Hartmann and Gerhard Barkhorn, Graf’s best pilots, {{returned}} to active duty. Within a month, they both achieved their 300th victories. On New Year’s Day, the Luftwaffe's western command launched Operation Bodenplatte, against Allied air forces {{based in the}} Low Countries. It was an unsuccessful attempt to support the Battle of the Bulge offensive. For the failure, Göring fired Galland as General of the Fighters. In response, a meeting of senior Geschwadern commanders, in early January (including Graf), agreed to approach Göring and demand major changes. When confronted, Göring was furious and immediately demoted all the fighter leaders aside from Graf, <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> as Kommodore of JG52 because of the unit’s exemplary war record. Göring told Graf he needed him against the imminent Soviet attack.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, after SAO Krajina forces {{captured}} Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, {{the conflict}} shifted north, where {{a new line}} of control was established south of ZNG-controlled Sunja and Novska. Daily skirmishes continued there. After the ZNG pulled out of Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica, a substantial number of civilians left the area as well, leaving only about 120 Croat civilians in the two towns and the surrounding villages. About half of these stayed behind in Hrvatska Dubica, where looting and torching of houses owned by Croats or Serbs who had previously fled the town continued until mid-October. Most of the civilians <b>who</b> <b>stayed</b> in their homes were elderly or women.|$|E
