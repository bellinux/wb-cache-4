5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} also {{focused on the}} divorce's effects on Milhouse {{and there was a}} subplot that {{involved}} Bart being jealous of Milhouse and <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> Marge and Homer would also separate. Several scenes were written and animated for the episode, but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long. The third act of the episode shifts the focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience's interest for an entire episode. Bill Oakley has said that he felt the episode would have failed had they stuck with the Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move.|$|E

Sinclair says that <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> an autistic person be cured is equivalent to <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> they disappear and another completely different person exist in their place. Visions for a future where autism has been eradicated, Sinclair believes, is the desire to end the autistic culture.|$|E

Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Daisy Aldan of World Literature Today criticized Angelou for {{harboring}} [...] "a fanatic hostility expressed {{toward all}} white people", but writer Lyman B. Hagen disagreed, stating that like Angelou's friend and mentor Langston Hughes, Angelou explained and illuminated {{the condition of}} African Americans, but without alienating her readers. Angelou promoted the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break the African-American stereotype of laziness. [...] Her description of the strong and cohesive Black community of Stamps demonstrated how African Americans have subverted repressive institutions to withstand racism. [...] Angelou evolved from <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> she could become white in Caged Bird to later shedding her self-loathing and embracing a strong racial identity.|$|E
500|$|Spencer McIlvaine at Nintendo Life was {{disappointed}} {{in how the}} Wii version only had a single use for motion controls, and how low-resolution graphics from handheld versions of the game were used. Dan Whitehead at Eurogamer similarly thought that the motion controls were only a minor addition, and {{was disappointed}} in how little effort Capcom had put into the port compared to LucasArts' remake of The Secret of Monkey Island. Craig Harris at IGN called it [...] "incredibly lazy", <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> it had included improved art and sharper text. Cara Ellison at Eurogamer called the Trilogy HD port [...] "perfunctory", saying that animations are slow at times, that the high-definition graphics {{take away from the}} charm of the pixel art in previous versions, {{and that there is a}} delay after button presses.|$|E
500|$|Derek Malcolm in The Guardian was broadly {{approving}} of Licence to Kill, {{liking the}} [...] "harder {{edge of the}} earlier Bonds" [...] that the film emulated, but <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it was written and directed with a bit more flair."

[...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Philip French noted that [...] "despite the playful sparkle in his eyes, Timothy Dalton's Bond is... serious here." [...] Overall French called Licence to Kill [...] "an entertaining, untaxing film". Ian Christie in the Daily Express excoriated the film, saying that the plot was [...] "absurd but fundamentally dull", a further problem being that as [...] "there isn't a coherent storyline to link , they eventually become tiresome." ...|$|E

[...] While <b>wishing</b> <b>that</b> it had come earlier in the season, the reviewer wrote that [...] "its intense style and emotional stakes {{put it on the}} shortlist of best Veronica Mars episodes." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com praised the dream sequences for their beauty, but criticized them for their complexity.

Four days later Shaw encountered Agnes Naismith, an old woman reputed to be a witch. The following day, 22 August, Shaw became violently ill with fits, similar to the symptoms reported a few years earlier in the American Salem witch trials of 1693. After eight weeks Shaw's parents took her to see the eminent Glasgow physician Matthew Brisbane, who could find no cause for her symptoms. For eight days after her visit Shaw seemed to have recovered, but then [...] "the fits returned with increased violence. She would become as stiff as a corpse and be senseless and motionless".|$|E

In her review for the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Mary Jo Neitz of the University of Missouri was more critical, arguing that Berger had generalised information from the north-eastern U.S. and claimed that it was applicable for the Pagan community across the entire country, something which Neitz felt was counter to her [...] "own observations of Wicca." ...|$|E
