5|$|In 1887, {{the first}} book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley, {{a pioneer in the}} field of tornado research. While it was a revolutionary book {{containing}} many breakthrough ideas, it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false. One of these <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe, and should be avoided when seeking shelter from a tornado.|$|E
5|$|Saltationism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{new species}} arise {{as a result}} of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel {{at the speed of}} light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E

5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> God {{intervened in}} the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E
25|$|Neo-Lamarckism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{evolution}} {{was driven}} by the inheritance of characteristics acquired during {{the life of the}} organism.|$|E
50|$|Tidal {{triggering}} of earthquakes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> tidal forces {{may induce}} seismicity.|$|R
50|$|Structure {{and agency}} are opposites. Agency <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a person's life {{outcomes}} are due entirely, or significantly {{influenced by their}} own individual efforts. Social structure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> life outcomes <b>are</b> due entirely, or significantly influenced by the individual's race, class, gender, social status, inherited wealth, legal situation, and many other factors that <b>are</b> outside <b>the</b> individual's control.|$|R
25|$|The {{problem of}} hell <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> eternal damnation contradicts God's omnibenevolence and omnipresence.|$|R
25|$|Mutationism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{evolution}} {{was largely}} {{the product of}} mutations that created new forms or species in a single step.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary to Shiki <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{traditional}} Japanese poetic short forms, {{such as the}} haiku and tanka, were waning due {{to their}} incongruity in the modern Meiji period. Shiki, at times, expressed similar sentiments. There were no great living practitioners although these forms of poetry retained some popularity.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Consensus {{view that}} current account {{imbalances}} do not matter continued {{even in the}} face of a ballooning US deficit, with mainstream academic opinion only turning to the view that the imbalances are unsustainable by 2007. Another notable anti-Keynesian view that remained dominant in US and UK policy making circles <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> markets work best if they are unregulated.|$|E

25|$|Thomson {{has said}} that his {{painting}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Stella Vine used for her painting of Princess Diana, Hi Paul Can You Come Over, that launched her to fame when it was bought by Charles Saatchi in 2004. Three years before, {{she had been a}} member of the Stuckist group and also briefly married to Thomson, who said that she was aware of the media appeal of the idea, as he had shown her press cuttings of the painting.|$|E
25|$|In the South, {{church leaders}} and Christians {{began to use}} the Bible and church {{doctrine}} to defend slavery. They had biblical, charitable, evangelistic, social, and political reasonings behind their defense of slavery, including arguments like Biblical figures having owned slaves and that slavery allows African Americans to become Christian. Another prominent reason used to justify slavery <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Christians should focus on evangelism, stay out of politics, and follow the law. By 1860, one year {{before the start of}} the American Civil War, 11% of African Americans belonged to a Christian church.|$|E
25|$|Mutationism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{new forms}} and species arose {{in a single}} step {{as a result of}} large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection. It was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, who along with Carl Correns helped rediscover Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance in 1900, William Bateson a British zoologist who switched to genetics, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan.|$|E
50|$|Associationism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> mental {{processes}} operate by {{the association}} of one mental state with its successor states.|$|R

25|$|Praised by T. S. Eliot as {{the most}} {{powerful}} intellectual influence in Britain, historian Christopher Dawson is a key figure in 20th-century traditionalism. Central to his work <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> religion {{was at the heart of}} every culture, especially Western culture and his writings, including The Age of Gods (1928), Religion and Culture (1948) and Religion and the Rise of Western Culture (1950), reflected this view. A contributor to Eliot's Criterion, Dawson believed that after World War II, religion and culture were central to rebuilding the West in the wake of fascism and the rise of communism.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurrent}} {{themes of}} these painstakingly detailed new theories <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour {{may be seen}} to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously {{in such areas as}} those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.|$|E
25|$|Another {{dominant}} {{message that}} was found in Protestant propaganda <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> every person should be granted access to the Bible to interpret it for themselves; this was the primary reason why Luther translated and published numerous copies of the New Testament during the Reformation years. Protestants questioned {{the belief that the}} Pope had the sole authority to interpret scripture. This can be seen in Luther’s publication titled To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, which criticized the Catholic belief that the Pope was supreme and could interpret scripture however he saw fit. To combat this, Luther put forth arguments from the Bible that indicated that everyone had the ability to interpret scripture and not just the Pope.|$|E

25|$|Behind the {{inclusion}} in a Shinto shrine of Buddhist religious objects <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the kami were lost beings {{in need of}} liberation through Buddhism like any other sentient beings. Kami {{were thought to be}} subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through rites and the reading of sutras, Buddhist monks would build temples next to kami shrines. Such groupings had been created by the 7th century, for example at Usa Jingū in Kyūshū, where Hachiman was worshiped together with Maitreya. The building of temples at shrines produced shrine-temple complexes, which in turn accelerated the amalgamation process. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had until then been just an open-air site became Buddhist style groupings of buildings.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
25|$|Manifest Destiny <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> it was God’s {{will for}} the United States to expand {{because it is}} Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became {{an important element of}} American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, and that is all that mattered.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of collectivism: {{institutional}} collectivism and in-group collectivism. Institutional collectivism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards, such as earning the same salary. In-group collectivism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> an individual's chosen group of people, such as family or friend groups, create a sense of collectivist nature. In-group collectivism can be referred to as family collectivism.|$|R
50|$|A theme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{humor and}} {{imagination}} {{are just as}} important as high purpose in helping people to persevere.|$|R
