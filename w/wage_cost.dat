Maccarrone made 23 appearances and scored 2 league goals in the 2010-11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.

At {{the start of his}} term, the President decried the high wage bill which was at 12% of GDP (as against a recommended 7%). In 2015, the President stated that the wage bill was at 50% of the total annual revenue collection of government. In an attempt to curtail it, the President announced a pay cut for himself and his Cabinet in March 2014, reducing his salary by 20%. It was hoped that the high earners in government would follow suit but this did not materialize. Another measure was the newly created constitutional Salaries and Remuneration Commission which it was hoped would regularize salaries but it has faced an up hill battle against Members of Parliament, who wish to protect their earnings and labour unions. The President thereafter ordered an audit of the government payroll so as to flush out ghost workers. The audit identified 12,000 ghost workers. [...] In the meantime, lower cadre government workers have demanded pay rises, more so by teachers and health workers, who have gone on strikes at various times to demand the increase. The strikes in the health sector mainly affect the counties, Kenya’s other level of government, as it is managed by the devolved units.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, the {{combined}} work capability {{of a human}} is also much {{lower than that of}} a machine. An average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9 hp (2.3 MJ per hour) [...] while a machine (depending on the type and size) can provide for far greater amounts of work. For example, it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kWh - which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel. This implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the required expended food calories (which is at least 4 to 20 times higher). In most situations, the worker will also want compensation for the lost time, which is easily 96 times greater per day. Even if we assume the real <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> for the human labour to be at US $1.00/day, an energy cost is generated of about $4.00/kWh. Despite this being a low wage for hard labour, even in some of the countries with the lowest wages, it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels (and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators).|$|E

Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of sacking, and 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for hessian, 94 for sacking and 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, sacking and CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of sacking 1,494 kg and a ton of CBC 1,813 kg.

3000|$|Results {{according}} to workers’ age {{can be understood}} through additional hypothesis testing. Estimates, based on our benchmark regression (see Table  3), suggest that the education-driven <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential is smaller among young workers than among older workers (z-statistic[*]=[*]− 2.48 and p value[*]=[*] 0.01), while the contribution of education to firm’s value added is {{not found to be}} statistically different across age groups (z-statistics[*]=[*]− 0.58 and p value[*]=[*] 0.56). 40, 41 The observation that the <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential between high- and low-educated workers increases with workers’ age {{can be explained by the}} fact that white-collar workers in Belgium are much more likely to be paid {{according to}} seniority than their blue-collar counterparts (which are typically less educated); this is arguably a result of separate collective agreements for blue- and white-collar workers and more widespread use of seniority-related pay scales in the agreements covering the latter (for more details see, e.g. Kampelmann and Rycx 2013). As a result, seniority-pay profiles are generally much steeper for high- than low-educated workers. A complementary explanation is that labour market regulations essentially affect the lower end of the wage distribution. Hence, they are more likely to compress the <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> differential between low- and high-educated workers when they are young. 42 Overall, results thus suggest that high-educated (low-educated) workers are no longer under-paid (over-paid) when they become older because their <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> to productivity ratio increases at a faster (slower) pace during their career than that of low-educated (high-educated) workers. 43 [...]...|$|E

The general result is that spans of control should increase as one goes down the levels of the hierarchy. However, when time savings become more and <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> less important, the difference between the optimum spans of control shrinks; in the limit, when <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> are not considered at all, they become equal.
