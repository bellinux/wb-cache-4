5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least {{as early as the}} 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E
5|$|Animal supporters, {{standing}} {{on either side}} of the shield to hold and guard it, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Various animals were sporadically shown supporting the Royal Arms of England, but it was only with the reign of Edward IV that their use became consistent. Supporters fell under the regulation of the Kings of Arms in the Tudor period. The heralds of that time also prochronistically created supporters for earlier monarchs, and although these attributed supporters were never used by the monarchs concerned, they were later used to signify them on public buildings or monuments completed after their deaths, for instance at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Period, a {{different}} form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as especially sacred, but as a species they {{were associated with the}} god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god Thoth, for instance, could be depicted as an ibis and as a baboon, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the Serapeum of Saqqara where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.|$|E
5|$|Fred Keenor {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, as one of eleven children. He {{was raised in the}} family home, a terraced house in Theodora Street in Roath, a suburb in Cardiff, by his father Robert Keenor and his mother Mary. His father worked as a stonemason in the city, working long hours {{in order to be able}} to afford the {{employment}} of Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions, Keenor sharing a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house which did not have an inside toilet.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{occasionally}} captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was {{a candidate}} to captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, when the two most likely men were {{unwilling or unable to}} lead the team. Dewhurst had acted as vice-captain of the West Indies team in 1926 to Harold Austin, but in the event, Karl Nunes was selected as captain. Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience. Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because he had not been chosen as vice-captain.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} myths were those describing {{the creation of the}} world. The Egyptian developed many accounts of the creation, which differ greatly in the events they describe. In particular, the deities credited with creating the world vary in each account. This difference partly reflects the desire of Egypt's cities and priesthoods to exalt their own patron gods by attributing creation to them. Yet the differing accounts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as contradictory; instead, the Egyptians saw the creation process as having many aspects and involving many divine forces.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{the type}} of patrol, a night march would {{normally}} {{be made to the}} area. Conditions could make this task most difficult, especially when it was so dark that the troopies were completely blind. Scarcity of water could present an issue to the patrol. The civilians <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as hostiles by the troops. There were numerous occasions when they helped each other and process of great empathy took place. If a patrol learned of enemy presence the patrol force immediately moved to engage the enemy. On occasions the patrols were ambushed. Patrols in Mozambique were considered the most hazardous, due to the violent reaction of FRELIMO (also known as FPML).|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the heartland}} and the {{legitimacy}} of dynastic succession were both essential aspects of the system. Originally the center was synonymous with the Zhongyuan, an area that was expanded through invasion and conquest over many centuries. The dynastic succession was at times subject to radical changes in interpretation, such as {{the period of the}} Southern Song when the ruling dynasty lost the traditional heartland to the northern barbarians. Outside the center were several concentric circles. Local ethnic minorities <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as 'foreign countries'. However, they were governed by their own leaders called Local Commanders (土司 tusi), subject to recognition by the Emperor, and were exempt from the Chinese bureaucratic system.|$|E

25|$|Whitehead was a {{right-handed}} lower-order batsman and a right-arm bowler {{who could}} bowl both off-breaks and medium-pace.

He played for Warwickshire from 1886, but the county's matches <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as first-class until 1894. Among his non-first-class matches for Warwickshire was the first match at the Bristol County Ground at Ashley Down, Bristol against Gloucestershire in which he ended W. G. Grace's first innings on the new ground by bowling him. His first first-class games were for the Liverpool and District side in 1891 and 1892, in matches against Yorkshire which the Liverpool side won in both years.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} , {{not only that}} the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it was almost as familiar as the British Constitution. It was known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial Committee <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> either as being familiar with the history or conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended from time to time, had played {{in the development of the}} nation, and the harmonious working of its political institutions.|$|E

500|$|Despite the work's {{commemorative}} value, {{no details}} about its first exhibition are known, {{and it is}} not mentioned in any surviving contemporaneous accounts. [...] This lack of commentary may be due to FernandoVII's preference for neoclassical art, and to the fact that popular revolts of any kind <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as suitable subject matter by the restored Bourbons.

He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental {{to the way we}} understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.|$|E
500|$|Discussions to {{establish}} {{the sovereignty of the}} archipelago commenced in the 1910s, but were interrupted by World War I. On 9 February 1920, following the Paris Peace Conference, the Svalbard Treaty was signed, granting full sovereignty to Norway. However, all signatory countries were granted non-discriminatory rights to fishing, hunting and mineral resources. The treaty took effect on 14 August 1925, {{at the same time as}} the Svalbard Act regulated the archipelago and the first governor, Johannes Gerckens Bassøe, took office. The archipelago has traditionally been known as Spitsbergen, and the main island as West Spitsbergen. From the 1920s, Norway renamed the archipelago Svalbard, and the main island became Spitsbergen. Kvitøya, Kong Karls Land, Hopen and Bjørnøya <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>regarded</b> as part of the Spitsbergen archipelago. Russians have traditionally called the archipelago Grumant (...) [...] The Soviet Union retained the name Spitsbergen (...) to support undocumented claims that Russians were the first to discover the island. In 1928, Italian explorer Umberto Nobile and the crew of the airship Italia crashed on the icepack off the coast of Foyn Island. The subsequent rescue attempts were covered extensively in the press and Svalbard received short-lived fame as a result.|$|E
