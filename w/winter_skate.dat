5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E

The importance of crustaceans in the skate's diet increases with size. This species shares its benthic habitat with the similar winter skate; the little skate focuses more on epifauna (organisms living atop the substrate) while the <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> eats more infauna (burrowing organisms).

An index of average percent error (IAPE) of 5. 8 % suggests that our aging method represents a precise approach to the age assessment of L. ocellata. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (Kruskal-Wallis P< 0. 001) and a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth began in July. Estimates of von Bertalanffy growth parameters suggest that females attain a slightly larger asymptotic TL (L∞= 1374 mm) than males (L∞= 1218 mm) and grow more slowly (k= 0. 059 and 0. 074, respectively). The oldest ages obtained for the <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> were 19 years for males and 18 years for females, which corresponded to total lengths of 932 mm and 940 mm, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{estimated}} {{the length and}} age of maturation in little skate Leucoraja erinacea and <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> L. ocellata based on samples of 1, 884 little skate and 1, 153 <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> ovaries collected from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Georges Bank. Two levels of maturity were recognized: onset maturity, which marks {{the onset of the}} allocation of energy from somatic growth to reproduction; and ‘‘functional’ ’ maturity, which marks the point when mature oocytes are released. Size at maturation increased with latitude in little skate, 50 % onset maturity occurring at 42. 5, 43. 0, and 46. 5 cm (total length) and 50 % functional maturity at 43, 44, and 46 cm for the mid-Atlantic, southern New England–Georges Bank, and Gulf of Maine regions, respectively. Based on age estimates from previously published work, the age at which little skate achieve functional maturation ranged between 7. 0 and 7. 5 years for the U. S. northeast coast. In <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> no statistically significant regional differences in maturation rates were found. Size at 50 % onset maturity was estimated to be 66 cm and at 50 % functional maturity 76 cm for the U. S. northeast coast. In <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> onset maturity occurred at 9. 5 years and functional maturity at 12. 5 years. Thus, functional maturity in this species occurred 3 years after the onset of maturation, indicating that the species has a long adolescence before contributing offspring to the population.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{two approaches}} {{were used to}} increase the knowledge of elasmobranch population dynamics and life history: (1), the comparative approach and (2), the species-specific approach. In the comparative approach I constructed standardized three-stage matrix models for 55 species of sharks and rays. Using these models I (1) conducted elasticity analyses {{to determine how the}} vital rates of mortality (M) and fertility (f) influence elasmobranch population growth rate r, (2) estimated sensitivity of elasticity to perturbation in vital rates, and (3) examined the taxonomic distribution of model inputs and species vital rates, such as size at maturity (Lmat), and total length (Lmax). I found positive relationships between the elasticity of Lambda (population growth rate) to changes in juvenile and adult stages to longevity and age at maturity; however, the age at maturity and the elasticity of Lambda to changes in the adult stage relationship appeared to be invariant. Combining vital rates and elasticities, I found similar suites of life histories and demographics within taxonomic groups at various levels. Further I examined where (or if) elasmobranchs fall in the evolved triangular ordination of life history strategies proposed by Winemiller and Rose (1992). My results indicate that when plotted using only the teleost ordination, elasmobranchs appear to be periodic strategists, outside the limits of the teleost ordination. However, when elasmobranch data is included in the ordination they form the extreme range of equilibrium strategists and are grouped by order. In the species-specific approach, I found evidence for a strong latitudinal trend in maximum size (l sub infinity) and size at maturation (lmat) in little skate with individuals in northern regions reaching a larger size at maturity and maximum length and growing slower than little skate from more southern regions. No similar trend was found in <b>winter</b> <b>skate.</b> Little skate is smaller, reaches maturity at a younger age is faster growing and shorter lived then <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> (Little skate: l sub infinity = 56. 1 cm, k = 0. 19 /yr, Tmax = 12. 5, Tmat = 7; Winter skate: l sub infinity = 122. 1 cm, k = 0. 07 /yr, Tmax = 20. 5, Tmat = 12. 5). <b>Winter</b> <b>skate</b> has higher annual fecundity then little skate of 26 - 101 and 21 - 57 eggs per year respectively.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that marine elasmobranch fishes accumulate the methylamine compounds trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), glycine-betaine (betaine) and sarcosine as osmolytes. The metabolism and accumulation of these compounds has received relatively little study in elasmobranchs, {{and as such}} {{the purpose of this}} thesis was to investigate aspects of methylamine metabolism, retention and accumulation. Experimental approaches range from multispecies comparisons to directed study of a single species (the <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> Leucoraja ocellata) at different levels of organization from the whole animal down to subcellular components. [...] Marine elasmobranchs and a euryhaline species in freshwater accumulate methylamines as the predominant intracellular non-urea organic osmolytes in muscle, whereas, freshwater species preferentially accumulated the β-amino acid taurine. All elasmobranch species examined in this thesis had measurable enzymatic capacity for betaine synthesis in the liver and strong correlation between hepatic betaine synthesizing enzymes and muscle betaine content was found. Only one species of the seven examined had measurable TMAO synthetic capacity and a phylogenetic explanation is proposed for the distribution of TMAO synthesis in elasmobranch fishes. [...] In a detailed study of TMAO metabolism in the <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> it was concluded that the presence of flavin-containing monoxygenase activity does not indicate the capacity for the synthesis of TMAO. Winter skates lack measurable endogenous TMAO synthesis, apparently obtaining this compound in the diet, and maintain levels without feeding as a result of very low whole animal TMAO losses (< 1 % day - 1). Betaine synthesis was also examined in detail in the <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> where the liver and kidney are the likely sites of synthesis. The enzymes of betaine synthesis from choline, choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, are localized in the mitochondria, {{as is the case in}} other animals. Winter skates do not activate betaine synthetic capacity in response to food deprivation or accumulate betaine in the muscle when exposed to a hyperosmotic challenge; however, muscle betaine content increases when they are fed a high betaine diet, suggesting exogenous methylamine supply may be a key determinant in muscle methylamine accumulation in elasmobranchs...|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of genetic versus epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution is a hotly debated topic, with studies showing that some species appear {{to be able to}} adapt rapidly without significant genetic change. Epigenetic mechanisms may be particularly important for the evolutionary potential of species with long maturation times and low reproductive potential (‘K-strategists’), particularly when faced with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we study the transcriptome of two populations of the <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> (Leucoraja ocellata), a typical ‘K-strategist’, in Atlantic Canada; an endemic population in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence and a large population on the Scotian Shelf. The endemic population has been able to adapt to a 10 °C higher water temperature over short evolutionary time (7000 years), dramatically reducing its body size (by 45 %) significantly below the minimum maturation size of Scotian Shelf and other populations of <b>winter</b> <b>skate,</b> as well as exhibiting other adaptations in life history and physiology. We demonstrate that the adaptive response to selection has an epigenetic basis, cataloguing 3653 changes in gene expression that may have enabled this species to rapidly respond to the novel environment. We argue that the epigenetic augmentation of species evolutionary potential (its regulation though gene expression) can enable K-strategists to survive and adapt to different environments, and this mechanism may be particularly important for the persistence of sharks, skates and rays in the light of future climate change...|$|E

Enzymes involved in establishing and maintaining DNA methylation patterns (DNA-methyltransferases: Dnmts) have been isolated and characterized in the teleost and mammalian lineages. There are structural similarities between enzymes as well as basic developmental expression patterns but there are fundamental differences in gene number and function in the context of two very different reproductive strategies. Subclass Elasmobranchii displays a wide variety of reproductive strategies and studying genome management in this subclass could provide great insight into the key differences and similarities in DNA methylation observed in the tetrapod and teleost models.

40|$|Three {{species of}} skates {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: thorny skate Amblyraja radiata, <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> Leucoraja ocellata, and smooth skate Malacoraja senta. Trends in their abundance and size are described using data from annual bottom-trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Biomass and the abundance of mature skates decreased over the 1971 – 2002 period, by 80 – 90 % for thorny and winter skates, {{and to a lesser}} degree for smooth skates. Abundance of juvenile thorny and smooth skates increased from the mid- 1980 s to a peak in the mid- 1990 s, and then declined in the late 1990 s. Mean length decreased by 20 – 30 % during the 1980 s {{for each of the three}} species. The increase in the abundance of juvenile skates in the 1990 s coincided with a collapse in the biomass of large-bodied demersal teleost fishes, a dramatic decline in fishing effort, a cooling of the cold intermediate layer in the southern Gulf and decreasing abundance of mature skates. The decline in the abundance of large skates may be an effect of fishing, though reported landings of skates have been low. These results for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence contrast those observed on Georges Bank and in the North Sea, where small elasmobranch species that were not targeted by fisheries increased in biomass as the biomass of heavily exploited groundfish stocks declined.

Jennings and Kaiser, 1998; Benaka, 1999; Langton and Auster, 1999; Kaiser and de Groot, 2000). As {{part of an effort to}} determine the effectiveness of marine closed areas in promoting recovery of commercial species (e. g. haddock, Melanogrammus aegelfinus; sea scallops, Placopecten magellanicus; yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea; cod, Gadus morhua), nontarget species, and habitat, a multidisciplinary research cruise was conducted by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service. The cruise was conducted in closed area II (CA-II) of the eastern portion of Georges Bank during 19 – 29 June 2000 (Fig. 1). The area has historically produced high landings of scallops but was closed in 1994 principally for groundfish recovery (Fogarty and Murawski, 1998). The southern portion of the area was reopened to scallop fishing from 15 June to 12 November 1999, and again from 15 June to 15 August 2000. While conducting our planned sampling, we observed scallop viscera (the noncalcareous remains from scallops that have been shucked by commercial fishermen at sea) in the stomachs of several fish species at some of these locations, namely little skate (Raja erinacea), <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> (R. ocellata), red hake (Urophycis chuss), and longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus).

40|$|Population {{models are}} needed to assess the threats to species at risk and to {{evaluate}} alternative management actions. Data to support modeling is limited for many species at risk, and commonly used approaches generally assume stationary vital rates, a questionable assumption given widespread ecosystem change. We describe a modeling approach {{that can be applied}} to time series of length composition data to estimate vital rates and test for changes in these rates. Our approach uses stage-structured population models fit within a Bayesian state–space model. This approach simultaneously allows for both process and observation uncertainty, and it facilitates incorporating prior information on population dynamics and on the monitoring process. We apply these models to populations of <b>winter</b> <b>skate</b> (Leucoraja ocellata) that have been designated as "endangered" or "threatened. " These models indicate that natural mortality has decreased for juveniles and increased for adults in these populations. The declines observed in these populations had been attributed to unsustainable rates of bycatch in fisheries for other groundfishes; our analyses indicate that increased natural mortality of adults is also an important factor contributing to these declines. Adult natural mortality was positively related to grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) abundance, suggesting the hypothesis that increased adult mortality reflected increased predation by expanding grey seal herds. Population projections indicated that the threatened population would be expected to stabilize at a low level of abundance if all fishery removals were eliminated, but that the endangered population would likely continue to decline {{even in the absence of}} fishery removals. We note that time series of size distributions are available for most marine fish populations monitored by research surveys, and we suggest that a similar approach could be used to extract information from these time series in order to estimate mortality rates and changes in these rates. 18 page(s...|$|E
