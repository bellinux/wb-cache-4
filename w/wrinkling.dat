5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, <b>wrinkling</b> and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} are triangular {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel <b>wrinkling</b> is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E

40|$|Realism of {{rendered}} {{human skin}} can be strongly enhanced by {{taking into account}} skin <b>wrinkles.</b> However, modeling <b>wrinkles</b> is a difficult task, and considerable time and effort are necessary to achieve satisfactory results. This paper presents a simple method to easily model <b>wrinkles</b> on human skin, nevertheless {{taking into account the}} properties of real <b>wrinkles.</b> <b>Wrinkles</b> are specified using intuitive parameters, and are generated over a triangle mesh representing a body part, such as a hand or a face. <b>Wrinkled</b> skin surfaces are rendered at an interactive frame rate, dynamically modulating <b>wrinkle</b> amplitude according to skin surface deformation while animating the body part. We demonstrate the ability of our method to model realistic <b>wrinkle</b> shapes by comparing them with real <b>wrinkles...</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are five}} types of tube drawing: tube sinking, mandrel drawing, {{stationary}} mandrel, moving mandrel, and floating mandrel. A mandrel {{is used in}} many of the types to prevent buckling or <b>wrinkling</b> in the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with lightly {{pigmented}} skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster {{aging of the}} skin, which shows in increased <b>wrinkling</b> and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes the degradation of protective tissue in the dermis, which confers {{the strength of the}} skin. It has been postulated that white women may develop wrinkles faster after menopause than black women because they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the study could not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected {{to be one of the}} contributing factors that promote <b>wrinkling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern humans {{commonly}} have a steep, even vertical forehead whereas {{their predecessors}} had foreheads that sloped strongly backwards.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>wrinkle</b> {{behavior in}} both flat and cylindrical membranes undergoing shear displacement. The {{goal is to}} establish a relationship between the <b>wrinkle</b> behavior in the two types of membranes and understand how different geometric properties affect the behavior. The analysis is an equilibrium path-tracking analysis using the finite-element method. By applying cyclic boundary conditions to a flat membrane, a degree of similarity in the <b>wrinkle</b> behavior can be established between flat and cylindrical membranes. In both membranes, the initial <b>wrinkles</b> cover the entire membrane. These <b>wrinkles</b> are followed by smaller, localized <b>wrinkles,</b> referred to as collapsed sections. These collapsed sections form on existing <b>wrinkles.</b> The generation of new <b>wrinkles,</b> by splitting the existing <b>wrinkles,</b> is controlled by collapsed sections and is the same in both types of membranes. For the cylindrical membrane, the curved shape results in a more controlled <b>wrinkle</b> behavior. This is represented by fewer bifurcation points that require larger values of shear to occur. Second, the collapsed section frequency and position are fixed with respect to the <b>wrinkle</b> frequency and position. The cause of simplified and controlled <b>wrinkle</b> behavior is analyzed, and the control mechanism is explained...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation of facial <b>wrinkles</b> {{has not been}} fully clarified due {{to the existence of}} many distinct influential factors. To clarify the relationship between facial <b>wrinkles</b> and structures in the skin, image analysis was performed on the donated cadaveric skin specimens. Specimens were obtained from forehead and lateral canthus region after measuring <b>wrinkle</b> depth. Then tissue slices were prepared to observe dermal thickness, sebaceous gland density, solar elastosis degree, retinacula cutis density and then measured and analyzed in relation to <b>wrinkle</b> depth. The dermis under a <b>wrinkle</b> becomes thinner in association with the progression of <b>wrinkles</b> until the dermis becomes thinner than one-half of its original thickness. When the dermis stops thinning, <b>wrinkles</b> develop further by dermal invagination into the subcutaneous layer. Sebaceous gland density seems {{to be one of the}} multiple factors that prevent <b>wrinkle</b> deepening. Solar elastosis tends to develop with the development of a <b>wrinkle</b> until the <b>wrinkle</b> becomes deeper than 0. 6 mm. This tendency is less evident at <b>wrinkle</b> points than at non-wrinkle points. In addition, specimens with a higher sebaceous gland density tended to have a thicker dermis and/or less solar elastosis. Facial <b>wrinkles</b> seem to develop above sites of reduced lower retinacula cutis density. As a <b>wrinkle</b> develops, the density declines in both the wrinkle-specific and the wrinkle-inclusive areas, while the density difference between those areas vanishes. Preventing ultraviolet ray leads to preventing the facial <b>wrinkles</b> a few decades later...|$|R

25|$|Oily skin {{is caused}} by over-active sebaceous glands, that produce a {{substance}} called sebum, a naturally healthy skin lubricant. When the skin produces excessive sebum, it becomes heavy and thick in texture. Oily skin is typified by shininess, blemishes and pimples. The oily-skin type is not necessarily bad, since such skin is less prone to <b>wrinkling,</b> or other signs of aging, because the oil helps to keep needed moisture locked into the epidermis (outermost layer of skin).|$|E

40|$|Controlling the {{specific}} adhesive properties of surfaces is a technologically complex challenge that has piqued {{the interest of}} many research groups around the world. While many scientists have used complex topographic and chemically altered surfaces to tune adhesion, others have shown that naturally occurring phenomena, such as elastic instabilities, can impact adhesion. We provide a thorough investigation into the effects of periodic surface buckling instabilities, or <b>wrinkles,</b> on adhesion. <b>Wrinkles</b> are an attractive surface patterning alternative as they form spontaneously over large areas and their dimensions, namely wavelength and amplitude, can be controlled on length scales relevant for adhesion control. We focus {{on the development of}} fundamental relationships that relate <b>wrinkle</b> adhesion to materials properties and topographic feature geometry. To accomplish this goal, we first investigate the separation of a flat rigid punch from a single elastic cylinder, which models the separation of a single <b>wrinkle.</b> The knowledge gained from this study is then utilized to develop a scaling expression relating adherence force to <b>wrinkle</b> geometry, materials properties, and testing geometry. This scaling theory is validated by varying these parameters systematically in a series of model <b>wrinkle</b> adhesion experiments. Added complexity in the form of varied crosslinker density, which alters the ratio of storage to loss moduli, and geometric confinement effects on <b>wrinkle</b> adhesion are then studied. Finally, a novel technique for fabricating biaxial <b>wrinkles</b> with two independently-adjusted wavelengths is developed, adding an additional parameter which can be tuned to further control adhesion. ^ A single elastic cylinder was probed with a finite rigid flat probe, allowing the separation mechanism of a single 2 ̆ 2 macro 2 ̆ 2 scale <b>wrinkle</b> to be determined. Rather than a long cylinder contact mechanism, which has been utilized in describing <b>wrinkle</b> adhesion mechanisms in the past, an elliptical contact area approximation was found to more appropriately describe the single cylinder adhesion data. ^ To consider the impact of an array of cylinders on adhesion, a model <b>wrinkle</b> system comprised of an elastomeric foundation and chemically-simple polymer film was developed. The <b>wrinkle</b> wavelength, amplitude, substrate modulus, and probe radius were varied, and the normal adhesive response of each aligned <b>wrinkled</b> surface was determined. Overall, <b>wrinkles</b> were found to decrease the separation force relative to a smooth surface and the separation force varied inversely with the square root of a <b>wrinkle</b> dimension, either wavelength or amplitude. ^ The effects of viscoelasticity on the adhesion of a <b>wrinkled</b> substrate that is geometrically confined was studied. <b>Wrinkled</b> surface features were molded onto the surface of a rigid cylindrical probe, and the normal adhesion of these probes contacting thin elastomeric films fabricated with varying crosslinker concentrations was measured. The materials-defined length scale relating adhesion energy and modulus controlled the <b>wrinkle</b> feature sizes that impacted the adhesive response of each smooth film. In the most highly crosslinked films, small <b>wrinkles</b> increased both the separation force and adhesion energy of the interface two-fold, while large <b>wrinkles</b> reduced adhesion to almost nothing. ^ Capitalizing on knowledge gained in the fabrication of many <b>wrinkled</b> surfaces, a novel technique for fabricating biaxial <b>wrinkles</b> was developed. Aligned <b>wrinkles</b> were formed on a partially crosslinked substrate, the modulus of the substrate was increased by allowing the material to crosslink completely, and a mechanical compressive strain was then imposed orthogonal to the primary <b>wrinkle</b> direction. This process resulted in the formation of biaxial <b>wrinkled</b> surfaces with two distinct, independently controlled lateral dimensions or wavelengths. ...|$|R

The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or <b>wrinkling.</b> The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a novel technique to fabricate mechanically tunable slippery surfaces using one dimensional (anisotropic) elastic <b>wrinkles.</b> Such <b>wrinkles</b> show tunable topography (amplitude) {{on the application}} of mechanical strain. Following Nepenthes pitcher plants, lubricating fluid infused solid surfaces show excellent slippery behavior for test liquid drops.

Completely stretched (flat) <b>wrinkles</b> have uniform coating of lubricating fluid whereas completely relaxed (full amplitude) <b>wrinkles</b> have most of the lubricating oil in the <b>wrinkle</b> grooves. Therefore water drops on completely stretched surface show excellent slippery behavior whereas on completely relaxed surface they show very poor slippery behavior. Therefore continuous variation of <b>wrinkle</b> stretching provide reversibly tunable slippery behavior on such system.
