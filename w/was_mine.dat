5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father <b>was</b> <b>mine.</b> Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

500|$|The {{juxtaposition}} of such disparate programming inspired U2 and Achtung Baby co-producer Brian Eno to conceive an [...] "audio-visual show" [...] that would display {{a rapidly changing}} mix of live and pre-recorded video on monitors. The idea was intended to mock the desensitising effect of mass media. Eno, who was credited in the tour programme for the [...] "Video Staging Concept", explained his vision for the tour: [...] "the idea to make a stage set {{with a lot of}} different video sources <b>was</b> <b>mine,</b> to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... The idea of getting away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{critically}} discussed {{issue in the}} play is the sequence, bizarre by modern Western European standards, in Act 5, Scene 4 in which Valentine seems to 'give' Silvia to Proteus {{as a sign of}} his friendship. For many years, the general critical consensus on this issue was that the incident revealed an inherent misogyny in the text. For example, Hilary Spurling wrote in 1970, [...] "Valentine is so overcome [...] that he promptly offers to hand over his beloved to the man who, not three minutes before, had meant to rape her." [...] Modern scholarship, however, is much more divided about Valentine's actions {{at the end of the}} play, with some critics arguing that he does not offer to give Silvia to Proteus at all. The ambiguity lies in the line [...] "All that <b>was</b> <b>mine</b> in Silvia I give thee" [...] (5.4.83). Some critics (such as Stanley Wells, for example) interpret this to mean that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to her would-be rapist, but another school of thought suggests that Valentine simply means [...] "I will love you [...] with as much love as I love Silvia," [...] thus reconciling the dichotomy of friendship and love as depicted elsewhere in the play. This is certainly how Jeffrey Masten, for example, sees it, arguing that the play as a whole [...] "reveals not the opposition of male friendship and Petrarchan love but rather their interdependence." [...] As such, the final scene [...] "stages the play's ultimate collaboration of male friendship and its incorporation of the plot we would label [...] "heterosexual"." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{her final}} WWF angle, WWF World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair bragged that he dated Elizabeth before Savage met her. Flair's tagline was, [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>mine</b> {{before she was}} yours." [...] He showed photos of himself with Elizabeth in casual situations, which were later printed in an issue of WWF Magazine. It was later {{revealed}} that the photos were in fact pictures of Savage and Elizabeth, which Flair had doctored. [...] Flair, with Mr. Perfect as his [...] "executive consultant", {{said that they were}} going to show a nude photo of Elizabeth on the screen at WrestleMania VIII, although this did not occur. Nonetheless, Flair's claims set up his WrestleMania VIII match with Savage. During the match, Elizabeth made her way to ringside, against the wishes of WWF officials. After Savage pinned Flair to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, an angry Flair cornered Elizabeth and began to kiss her; Elizabeth slapped Flair away, and Savage began beating Flair until ring officials broke the two up. Elizabeth's final WWF appearance took place on April 19, 1992 during an overseas tour of England; in that match, Savage pinned Shawn Michaels after Elizabeth, who had earlier been sent backstage, returned to prevent Sherri's interference on Michaels' behalf. Despite her departure, the Elizabeth-Flair storyline continued through most of the spring – the most notable highlight was Flair and Mr. Perfect playing a voice mail from a woman identifying herself as Elizabeth, saying she was [...] "waiting at home" [...] and that she [...] "loved" [...] him – until the Savage-Michaels match from England was aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling in June; the publication of the actual Savage-Elizabeth photos in WWF Magazine came at about that same time.|$|E
