Engaging four {{trawlers}} MGB 78 <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a depth charge attack and was lost to enemy fire. Another boat, MGB 76, was lost during the night of 5/6 October 1942, when the flotilla was ambushed by two German torpedo boats {{and a number of}} E boats.|$|E
5|$|The next year—1909—followed {{much the}} same pattern. KzS Ehler Behring {{replaced}} von Krosigk in April. In June, Deutschland won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting in the II Squadron. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which Deutschland stopped in Bilbao, Spain. While {{on the way back}} to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. After another round of exercises, Deutschland <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a periodic overhaul. During the refit, she was given additional pedestal-mounted searchlights and became the first ship in the German navy to be equipped with an X-ray machine. In late 1909, Prince Heinrich was replaced by Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, who kept Deutschland as his flagship. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E

She was laid down on 30 August 1940 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel and launched 11 December of that year. Dunvegan was commissioned 9 September 1941 at Sorel. She <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> her first refit in December 1941 for repairs which took until January 1942. A second refit took place in October 1943 where, in Baltimore, her fo'c'sle was extended. The refit took until December 1943 to complete.|$|E
25|$|Bolton {{visited the}} Riverside {{still in the}} relegation battle, while the home side {{had the chance to}} make {{themselves}} mathematically safe with a victory. Gary O'Neil, suspended anyway for this match and the next, was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season with an injury and was replaced by Tuncay. Ross Turnbull was given a chance in goal after Mark Schwarzer was ruled out with a back problem. Boro dominated the opening minutes of first half, but <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> half time level. Bolton performed much better in the second half, and Boro much worse. Though the home side were denied a penalty shortly before the hour, the visitors took the 1–0 lead shortly after through Gavin McCann.|$|E

25|$|After {{overnight}} {{track work}} to fix {{problems with the}} track at turn 10, the race started with Hamilton holding his lead and all the cars making it through the first corner. Hamilton built up a lead of over 5 seconds over Robert Kubica before Adrian Sutil had a gearbox failure on the 16th lap and parked his car after turn 3. Sutil's car was off the track but after it caught fire the safety car was brought out, {{and there was a}} rush of drivers into the pits as all of the six lead drivers <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> their pit stops. Hamilton led Räikkönen and Kubica into the pitlane but Räikkönen took the lead as they left their garages, with Kubica alongside him and Hamilton behind.|$|E
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the {{lightweight}} division in order to fight The Ring Lightweight Champion Joel Casamayor on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 13, 2008, he defeated Casamayor in the 11th round after two knockdowns and captured his sixth world title in three different weight classes. In the first four rounds of the bout, Márquez continually walked into counter punches from Casamayor. It took Márquez until the fifth round {{to be able to}} find the range with his right hand. By the fifth round, a cut over Casamayor's right eye was opened from a clash of heads. Rounds five, six, seven and eight were rounds where Márquez landed straight punches from the outside, but he was also struck by Casamayor whenever he lunged forward. Two minutes into the eleventh round, Casamayor was knocked down by a right punch as he pulled away from an intense exchange. Casamayor was able to get on his feet, but it was clear he was still shakey from the knockdown. As soon as the action was allowed to resume, Márquez <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the kill as he let his punches go in furious combination. Casamayor punched back, but he was knocked down again with about 7 seconds left in the round. Referee Tony Weeks stepped in the bout and stopped the fight as he deemed Casamayor unable to continue. The official judges had the fight scored 95–95, 95–95 and 97–93 for Márquez before the 11th-round knockout. After the win, The Ring magazine ranked Márquez second on its pound for pound list and rated him the number one boxer in the lightweight division.|$|E

In DC Comics, Bart typically goes by the codename of [...] "Impulse", but did have a short series in 2006 where {{he took over the}} role of Flash. Kyle Gallner learned through his agent about a superhero role being called for on Smallville, and when he learned {{that it was going to}} be Impulse, he convinced himself that he was going to win the role. Gallner <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> two auditions, but was so disappointed with his performance during the second audition that he believed he had failed to get the role. His fear was unfounded when the producers offered him the part.|$|E
500|$|Dolan {{gave him}} a {{contract}} for the 2000–01 season and appointed him as York's captain despite the concerns over his knee. Swan battled against his own body to play all the pre-season friendlies, including a clash with Manchester United and their star players of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, and Paul Scholes. He was sent off {{in the first game}} of the season after attempting to headbutt Chesterfield's Steve Blatherwick. He captained the [...] "Minstermen" [...] for the first and only time at Bootham Crescent against Cheltenham Town, before he <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> some keyhole surgery to clean out his knee. The surgeon told Swan that [...] "the mess in there is unbelievable... there's no cartilage, there are bits floating around everywhere and it's riddled with arthritis" [...] and warned him that any further matches could see him confined to a wheelchair. After a few weeks Swan accepted both Dolan's and the surgeon's advice and retired.|$|E
500|$|Webber {{qualified}} 13th at the [...] After some first corner incidents he was {{stranded in}} last place; {{from there he}} progressed up the order, {{at one point in}} time sitting in fourth. Following his pit stop he emerged in 10th, with Nick Heidfeld and Nico Rosberg yet to pit, from where he continued to push, regained 8th once the two drivers in 8th and 9th both <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> their final pit stops. With two laps to go, Webber's tyres were close to bald– being compared to slicks. Losing almost 3 seconds a lap to the chasing Ferrari of Felipe Massa, who was on fresh tyres, he defended his point vigorously. Pressured by the Ferrari, he was out-powered by the superior engine of Massa and although great attempts at saving his place were shown, he finished in a hard-fought 9th position, on a one stop strategy which was then upgraded to 8th position after a post-race penalty to Sébastien Bourdais.|$|E

She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning.

500|$|Following Italy's {{entry into}} the war on 10June 1940, Waller was {{involved}} in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21June, Stuart shelled the Italian-held town of Bardia. The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the Battle of Calabria. Waller's ships carried out bombardments on Fort Capuzzo on 17August and an Italian seaplane base in the Gulf of Bomba one week later. In September, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for [...] "courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements"—in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields. The same month, he transferred to HMAS Vampire while Stuart <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> refit. As the Allied armies began to counterattack Italian forces in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries. In his role as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller took charge of naval support for the attack on Bardia, which fell to the Allies on 5January 1941. Shortly afterwards, he handed over command of the Inshore Squadron and transferred back aboard Stuart.|$|E
