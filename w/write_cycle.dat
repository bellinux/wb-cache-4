50|$|In memory applications, the stored {{value of}} a {{ferroelectric}} capacitor is read by applying an electric field. The amount of charge needed to flip the memory cell to the opposite state is measured and the previous state of the cell is revealed. This means that the read operation destroys the memory cell state, {{and has to be}} followed by a corresponding write operation, in order to write the bit back. This makes it similar to the ferrite core memory. The requirement for a <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> for each read cycle, together with the high but not infinite <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> limit, sets a potential problem for some special applications.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hidden refresh" [...] - This is an {{alternate}} {{version of the}} CBR refresh cycle which can be combined with a preceding read or <b>write</b> <b>cycle.</b> [...] The refresh is done in parallel during the data transfer, saving time.|$|E

5000|$|August - Scientists in Germany have {{developed}} next-generation MRAM that {{is said to}} operate as fast as fundamental performance limits allow, with <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> under 1 nanosecond.|$|R
5000|$|December - Freescale Semiconductor Inc. {{demonstrates}} an MRAM {{that uses}} magnesium oxide, {{rather than an}} aluminum oxide, allowing for a thinner insulating tunnel barrier and improved bit resistance during the <b>write</b> <b>cycle,</b> thereby reducing the required write current.|$|E
50|$|The 8255's outputs are latched to {{hold the}} last data written to them. This is {{required}} because the data only stays on the bus for one cycle, so without latching the outputs would become invalid {{as soon as the}} <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> finished.|$|E
5000|$|Zero bus {{turnaround}} (ZBT) [...] {{the turnaround}} {{is the number}} of clock cycles it takes to change access to the SRAM from write to read and vice versa. The turnaround for ZBT SRAMs or the latency between read and <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> is zero.|$|E
50|$|Mussorgsky wrote Sunless (1874), The Nursery (1868-72) and Songs and Dances of Death (1875-77), and Shostakovich <b>wrote</b> <b>cycles</b> on English and Yiddish poets, {{as well as}} Michelangelo and Alexander Pushkin.|$|R
5000|$|Recent Trusted Platform Module {{specifications}} define special TPM-Read {{cycles and}} TPM-Write cycles {{that are based}} on the I/O Read and the I/O <b>Write</b> <b>cycles.</b> These cycles use a START field with the formerly-reserved value of 0101 and place a 16-bit memory address offset in the address field. These cycles are used when using a TPM's locality facility.|$|R
50|$|These {{concepts}} are demonstrated in Lauron's products, one of {{such is the}} LT-PCI-CF. This PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) adapter uses a RAID bridge IC which is the host bus adapter. The RAID interface can be configured as a 4 port data path. Doing such improves performance since data is transferred on all 4 ports simultaneously. It also offers the improved endurance ratings as less <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> are needed {{for the same amount}} of data written to the device. CompactFlash is used for the media, which is consistently less expensive than SSD modules. CompactFlash endurance specifications range, but industrial versions offers the endurance of 2,000,000 <b>write</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|R
50|$|PRAM {{is also a}} {{promising}} technology {{in the military and}} aerospace industries where radiation effects make the use of standard non-volatile memories such as Flash impractical. PRAM memory devices have been introduced by BAE Systems, referred to as C-RAM, claiming excellent radiation tolerance (rad-hard) and latchup immunity. In addition, BAE claims a <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> endurance of 108, which will allow it to be a contender for replacing PROMs and EEPROMs in space systems.|$|E
5000|$|... i-RAM is a {{solid-state}} disk {{which has}} four DIMM slots to allow regular PC RAM {{to be used}} like a disk. It is much faster than a hard disk, {{does not have the}} <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> limitations of flash memory, however it requires power continuously in order to maintain its contents (from standby power or a battery when the system is off), uses more power than many laptop hard drives, has maximum capacity of 4 GiB, and is expensive.|$|E
50|$|A posted write is a {{computer}} bus write transaction that does not wait for a write completion response to indicate {{success or failure of}} the write transaction. For a posted write, the CPU assumes that the <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> will complete with zero wait states, and so doesn't wait for the done. This speeds up writes considerably. For starters, it doesn't {{have to wait for the}} done response, but it also allows for better pipelining of the datapath without much performance penalty.|$|E
50|$|Many {{flash memory}} devices, such as USB memory sticks, include {{a flash memory}} {{controller}} on chip. Flash memory is inherently slower to access than RAM and often becomes unusable after a few million <b>write</b> <b>cycles,</b> which generally makes it unsuitable for RAM applications.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the number}} of writes to EEPROM is limited Atmel {{specifies}} 100,000 <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> in their datasheets a well designed EEPROM write routine should compare the contents of an EEPROM address with desired contents and only perform an actual write if the contents need to be changed.|$|R
50|$|The {{firmware}} stores {{its entire}} configuration {{in a single}} XML file. This simplifies backing up and restoring installations. It takes care to only write to its internal storage when absolutely necessary. This is done to preserve <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> on flash media, a typical installation media for embedded devices.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 she {{released}} her debut studio album entitled Wyspa (Island). In {{the same year}} she traveled to Berlin where she they took part in workshops led by Daan van Kampenhout. It inspired her to <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> of songsKołysanki na wieczny sen (Lullabies for the eternal sleep) consisting of fourteen tracks sung in Hebrew. Premiere concert {{took place during the}} Tzadik Festival in Poznan and in the beginning of October 2012 she published studio album of the same name recorded with a jazz quartet.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> {{requires}} both a pass {{to erase}} a region, and another pass to write information. Both passes use the laser to heat the recording layer; the magnetic field is used for actually changing the magnetic orientation of the recording layer. The electromagnet reverses polarity for writing, and the laser is pulsed to record spots of [...] "1" [...] over the erased region of [...] "0". As {{a result of this}} two-pass process, it takes twice as long to write data as it does to read it.|$|E
5000|$|As mentioned, the LPC bus is {{designed}} to have performance similar to the ISA bus. The exact data transfer rates depend {{on the type of}} bus access (I/O, memory, DMA, firmware) performed and by the speed of the host and the LPC device. All bus cycles except the 128-byte firmware read cycle, in which 256 of the 273 clock ticks consumed by this cycle actually are used to transfer data to get a throughput of 15.63 MB/s, spend a majority of their time in overhead rather than data transfer. [...] The next fastest bus cycle, the 32-bit ISA-style DMA <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> that is defined in this standard, can transfer up to 6.67 MB/s because only 8 out of 20 clock ticks used in this bus cycle actually transfer data {{with the rest of the}} cycles are overhead.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} 500 k <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> on 1 kbits TAS-MRAM arrays has been {{evaluated}} by extracting {{a set of}} characteristic parameters describing the technology in terms of cell-to-cell variability and switching reliability. The relationship between switching voltages and cell resistances has been investigated in order to define the most reliable working conditions...|$|R
50|$|PRAM devices also degrade with use, for {{different}} reasons than Flash, but degrade much more slowly. A PRAM device may endure around 100 million <b>write</b> <b>cycles.</b> PRAM lifetime is limited by mechanisms such as degradation due to GST thermal expansion during programming, metal (and other material) migration, and other mechanisms still unknown.|$|R

5000|$|The storage cells on {{a memory}} chip {{are laid out}} in a {{rectangular}} array of rows and columns. The read process in DRAM is destructive and removes the charge on the memory cells in an entire row, so there is a row of specialized latches on the chip called sense amplifiers, one for each column of memory cells, to temporarily hold the data. During a normal read operation, the sense amplifiers after reading and latching the data, rewrite the data in the accessed row before sending the bit from a single column to output. So the normal read electronics on the chip has the ability to refresh an entire row of memory in parallel, significantly speeding up the refresh process. A normal read or <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> refreshes a row of memory, but normal memory accesses cannot be relied on to hit all the rows within the necessary time, necessitating a separate refresh process. Rather than use the normal read cycle in the refresh process, to save time an abbreviated cycle called a refresh cycle is used. The refresh cycle is similar to the read cycle, but executes faster for two reasons: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> {{begins by}} {{applying}} the value to be written to the bit lines. If we wish to write a 0, we would apply a 0 to the bit lines, i.e. setting BL to 1 and BL to 0. This is similar to applying a reset pulse to an SR-latch, which causes the flip flop to change state. A 1 is written by inverting {{the values of the}} bit lines. WL is then asserted and the value that is to be stored is latched in. This works because the bit line input-drivers are designed to be much stronger than the relatively weak transistors in the cell itself so they can easily override the previous state of the cross-coupled inverters. In practice, access NMOS transistors M5 and M6 have to be stronger than either bottom NMOS (M1, M3) or top PMOS (M2, M4) transistors. This is easily obtained as PMOS transistors are much weaker than NMOS when same sized. Consequently when one transistor pair (e.g. M3 and M4) is only slightly overridden by the write process, the opposite transistors pair (M1 and M2) gate voltage is also changed. This means that the M1 and M2 transistors can be easier overridden, and so on. Thus, cross-coupled inverters magnify the writing process.|$|E
40|$|The {{switching}} thresholds of magnetophoretic transistors for sorting cells in microfluidic environments are characterized. The transistor operating conditions require short 20 - 30 mA pulses of electrical current. By demonstrating both attractive and repulsive transistor modes, a single transistor architecture {{is used to}} implement the full <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> for importing and exporting single cells in specified array sites...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{characterization}} results of 1 kbit TAS-MRAM arrays obtained through RIFLE Automated Test Equipment of 1 Kbit array are reported. Such ATE, ensuring flexibility {{in terms of}} signals and timing, allowed evaluating hysteresis and to perform 50 k <b>write</b> <b>cycles</b> in a very limited time, getting a first insight on TAS-MRAM arrays performance and reliability...|$|R

Gratings were optically written on azopolymer-coated side-polished fiber blocks, and a write 2 ̆ 013 erase 2 ̆ 013 <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> was demonstrated. Finite difference time domain simulations reveal that this optically reconfigurable device concept can be optimized in a silicon-on-insulator waveguide platform.

40|$|NAND Flash {{offers the}} {{potential}} to greatly improve and expand current technological developments. Devices that utilize NAND Flash for non-volatile memory solutions {{have the advantage of}} being smaller, faster, and less power consuming than those which rely on alternative disk based storage. Although NAND Flash offers many benefits over disk storage, there are still some issues that are preventing NAND Flash from becoming a truly mainstream product. One of the most prevalent problems concerning NAND Flash is its limited life endurance. NAND Flash has been shown to have an endurance life of around 100, 000 cycles. After this point, writing to NAND Flash becomes unreliable and little has been done to show how it could be made to continue to function. Henceforth, the design of a test application that could analyze NAND Flash devices that are stressed past their limits could greatly aid developers. Because NAND Flash applications will eventually surpass the 100, 000 <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> limit, if Flash technology is to continue to progress, it is essential that tools be created which will allow developers to analyze and characterize NAND Flash functionality past its present 100, 000 <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> barrier...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an ultra-low-leakage 2 T 1 C compact SRAM is {{proposed}} using Tunnel FETs (TFETs). Proposed design utilizes negative differential resistance property of TFETs and capacitor leakage to implement 1 T 1 C latch. Additional 1 T read port is added for reading to avoid data stability issues during read operation. Proposed SRAM design is scalable and easily adaptable for lower technology nodes. Ultra-low leakage below 1 fA/bit is {{achieved in the}} proposed design. Read and <b>write</b> <b>cycle</b> times of sub- 2 ns and sub- 4 ns are designed...|$|E
50|$|Because {{they are}} written by forcing {{electrons}} through {{a layer of}} electrical insulation onto a floating transistor gate, rewriteable ROMs can withstand {{only a limited number}} of <b>write</b> and erase <b>cycles</b> before the insulation is permanently damaged. In the earliest EPROMs, this might occur after as few as 1,000 <b>write</b> <b>cycles,</b> while in modern Flash EEPROM the endurance may exceed 1,000,000. The limited endurance, as well as the higher cost per bit, means that Flash-based storage is unlikely to completely supplant magnetic disk drives in the near future.|$|R
40|$|A CAD {{model of}} NOS {{transistor}} suitable for circuit simulation of an EPROM cell during <b>writing</b> <b>cycle</b> is proposed.

5000|$|The cycle {{per second}} was a once-common English {{name for the}} unit of {{frequency}} {{now known as the}} hertz. The plural form was typically used, often <b>written</b> <b>cycles</b> per second, cycles/second, c.p.s., c/s, ~, or, ambiguously, just cycles. The term {{comes from the fact that}} sound waves have a frequency measurable in their number of vibrations, or cycles, per second.|$|R
