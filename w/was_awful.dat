It {{consisted}} of the 3rd and 6th Armoured Divisions, two infantry brigades, twelve artillery battalions, and a special forces brigade. The two armoured divisions were, Pollack says, 'unquestionably the best formations of the Iraqi Army.'(Pollack p.167) Yet during their operations on the Golan Heights, their performance <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> in virtually every category of military effectiveness. Military intelligence, initiative, and small unit independent action was virtually absent.|$|E
25|$|Eraserhead {{was finally}} {{finished}} in 1976, {{after five years}} of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, though it was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and Eraserhead subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later described {{as one of the most}} important midnight movies of the seventies along with El Topo, Pink Flamingos, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Harder They Come and Night of the Living Dead. The acclaimed film maker Stanley Kubrick said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to drop the opener of a four-game series against the Giants, 3–1, in 10 innings as the struggling bullpen walked three batters in that inning. The losing streak hit three {{games in a row}} as Madison Bumgarner stymied their offense in another 3–1 defeat. The Dodgers won the next game in the series, 6–2 thanks to a strong effort from lead-off hitter Dee Gordon. He had two hits, scored two runs, stole three bases and had the tie-breaking RBI double in the seventh inning. The Dodgers staged a late inning comeback to send the series finale into extra innings but the bullpen faltered again and they lost 7–4. A 3-run homer by Puig carried the Dodgers to a 6–5 victory over the Marlins on May 12. Josh Beckett picked up his first win since September 30, 2012, the next day, as the Dodgers defeated the Marlins 7–1. Paul Maholm <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> the next day, giving up 10 runs on 11 hits as the team was blown out 13–3.|$|E

[...] The win guaranteed the Midshipmen {{a spot in the}} 2007 Poinsettia Bowl, held in San Diego, California on December 20, 2007; Navy lost the game to the Utah Utes, 35–32.

500|$|Over 1,600 {{people were}} killed {{instantly}} and 9,000 were injured, more than 300 of whom later died. Every building within a [...] radius, over 12,000 in total, was destroyed or badly damaged. Hundreds {{of people who had}} been watching the fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them. Stoves and lamps overturned by the force of the blast sparked fires throughout Halifax, particularly in the North End, where entire city blocks were caught up in the inferno, trapping residents inside their houses. Firefighter Billy Wells, who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body, described the devastation survivors faced: [...] "The sight <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> with people hanging out of windows dead. Some with their heads missing, and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires." [...] He was {{the only member of the}} eight-man crew of the fire engine [...] "Patricia" [...] to survive.|$|E
500|$|Rachel's characterization, {{especially}} her Christmas greed {{even though}} she is Jewish, was singled out for criticism in many reviews. VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] " [...] Rachel being really excited about {{what she was going to}} get for Christmas, {{even though she}}'s Jewish", and her end-of episode shout of [...] "Happy Hanukah" [...] a [...] "last minute patch job" [...] to [...] "stay true to the characters as they were at one time". Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was [...] "a character who makes a point of her Jewish heritage often". He added, [...] "she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode, so she could eventually realize that she <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> and change her ways." [...] Bell criticized Rachel's list of gifts, such as [...] "spray tan and teeth whitening", as [...] "back to square one" [...] after her nose-job storyline in the second season. Finn's contribution of a charity pig in Jewish Rachel's honor was deemed [...] "wrong on at least two levels" [...] by Chaney.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Jackie Gleason in How Do I Love Thee?. During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she wanted no part of it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death.|$|E

500|$|As death succeeded death, Dickinson {{found her}} world upended. In {{the fall of}} 1884, she wrote that [...] "The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come." [...] That summer she had seen [...] "a great {{darkness}} coming" [...] and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious {{late into the night}} and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: [...] "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson {{died at the age of}} 55. Austin wrote in his diary that [...] "the day <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [...] whistle sounded for six." [...] Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright's disease and its duration as two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|Development for The Hideous Sun Demon {{began after}} the 1957 release of The Astounding She-Monster, {{a science fiction}} film {{starring}} Clarke. In his contract for the film, Clarke was promised five percent of She-Monsters profits {{in addition to his}} salary. Although Clarke later admitted that the film <b>was</b> <b>awful,</b> it was a financial success, with Clarke receiving a sizable sum from the film's box office returns. Inspired by that film's financial success, Clarke decided to direct his own low-budget science fiction film. According to Clarke, the story for the film was inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which dealt with multiple personalities. Clarke and co-writer/director Tom Boutross (although some sources, including Clarke himself, say his friend Phil Hiner co-wrote the first draft) wrote the first draft of the screenplay, then-titled Saurus or Sauros, names taken from the Latin word meaning [...] "reptile". Other working titles for the film included Strange Pursuit and Terror in the Sun. Boutross, who is also credited as one of the film's co-directors, later edited films like Rat Fink (1965), A Man Called Dagger (1967) and 1974 hit The Legend of Boggy Creek. The first draft of the script was significantly different from what would be shown in the finished film. The original storyline centered on an explorer and a female lawyer searching for uranium in the country of Guatemala. While there, they are tormented by {{a man who had been}} mutated by experiments conducted on him by his scientist father, who is an expert in radiation, and when the young man is exposed to the sun, he transforms into a reptilian creature.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a related}} event, Purefoods {{alternate}} governor Rene Pardo resigned {{as chairman of}} the PBA ethics committee as a direct offshoot of the team’s disgruntlement on the way Barrios handled the James Yap case. Pardo said that, Barrios, who suspended Yap on the same day the commissioner met with some top Sta. Lucia officials at the EDSA Shangri-la Hotel, [...] "the timing <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> It should have been with some sense of propriety that the lunch offer was turned down." [...] Barrios on his part didn't see anything wrong with the lunch meeting since the meeting was done at a public place.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, matters {{got worse}} for the Wolverines, as they {{finished}} in last place with a 28-84 record. Bennett's batting average fell to [...]264, but his on-base percentage remained high at [...]334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. [...] Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: [...] "During {{the next four years}} [...] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> [...] I thought sometimes we were lucky to finish last. [...] Once we lost twenty-five straight games. [...] Every week I caught a new pitcher." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that <b>was</b> <b>awful.</b> Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best stuff at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Remington's fame {{made him}} a {{favorite}} of the Western Army officers fighting the last Native American battles. He was invited out West to make their portraits in the field and to gain them national publicity through Remington's articles and illustrations for Harper's Weekly, particularly General Nelson Miles, an Indian fighter who aspired to the presidency of the United States. In turn, Remington got exclusive access to the soldiers and their stories and boosted his reputation with the reading public as [...] "The Soldier Artist". One of his 1889 paintings depicts eight cavalrymen shooting at Apaches in the rear as they attempt to outrun the Indians. Another painting that year depicts cavalrymen in an Arizona sandstorm. Remington wrote that the [...] "heat <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> and the dust rose in clouds.

2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|By 1923, the Lolomi {{plan was}} progressing. Chester told the Daily Oklahoman {{that he wanted}} the Keetoowah some day to be [...] "in a {{position}} where they can work for the common good and build up a surplus {{for the good of the}} community." [...] However, shortly thereafter, the bank at Gore failed. The cattle herd was taken by creditors and those who had mortgaged their allotments lost their land. In the post War War I depression of the early 1920s, many sound banks and businesses failed, and the circumstances appear to have been beyond Kellogg's diligence. George Smith, fifth son of Redbird Smith, recalled, [...] "C.P. <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> smart. You couldn't get ahead of him. The white people was scared of him all the time, watching what he was doing with the Keetoowahs. He was a good man, but the white people were against him, and we had some bad luck." [...] After the collapse of the Lolomi Plan, some Keetoowahs believed that Cornelius cheated them and he was dismissed as spokesman for the Ketoowah Society [...] In 1925, Cornelius was raised as a chief of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and continued to reside in Gore, Oklahoma, and play a role with his sister in national Indian affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Delany won leading {{roles in}} a string of feature films such as the TV movie A Promise to Keep, Light Sleeper, Housesitter and Fly Away Home as well as {{appearing}} in the TV mini-series Wild Palms. She also took on controversial roles, such as Mistress Lisa in Exit to Eden, where one film critic commented [...] "The script <b>was</b> <b>awful</b> -- Dana looked great." [...] Delany commented in a 2008 interview about the audience reaction: [...] "I had already got pilloried for playing the Exit to Eden dominatrix after China Beach because audiences had a certain image of me as Colleen and didn’t want to see it change." [...] The provocatively titled Live Nude Girls included frank discussion by women of their sexual fantasies at a bachelorette party using a low-budget improvisational comedy format with strong chemistry between the actors. Reviews were mixed: Los Angeles Times critic Richard Natale liked the film but wrote older male film executives believed it to be [...] "uncommercial"; another critic agreed it was [...] "genuine girl talk" [...] but [...] "didn't have a lot of substance" [...] and viewers [...] "don't get to know the characters in the film".
