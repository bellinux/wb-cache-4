60|$|It {{is strange}} that any one, {{after such a}} warning, should rely implicitly on the {{evidence}} a priori of such propositions as these, that matter <b>can</b> <b>not</b> think; that space, or extension, is infinite; that nothing can be made out of nothing (ex nihilo nihil fit). Whether these propositions are true {{or not this is}} not the place to determine, nor even whether the questions are soluble by the human faculties. But such doctrines are no more self-evident truths, than the ancient maxim that a thing <b>can</b> <b>not</b> act where it is not, which probably is not now believed by any educated person in Europe.(236) Matter <b>can</b> <b>not</b> think; why? because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive thought to be annexed to any arrangement of material particles. Space is infinite, because having never known any part of it which had not other parts beyond it, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive an absolute termination. Ex nihilo nihil fit, because having never known any physical product without a pre-existing physical material, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> or think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> imagine a creation out of nothing. But these things may in themselves be as conceivable as gravitation without an intervening medium, which Newton thought too great an absurdity for any person of a competent faculty of philosophical thinking to admit: and even supposing them not conceivable, this, for aught we know, may be merely one of the limitations of our very limited minds, and not in nature at all.|$|R
