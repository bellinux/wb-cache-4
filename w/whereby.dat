5|$|Fornebu Boligspar later {{determined}} {{that it was more}} profitable to build apartments at the arena site. Negotiations started between the club, the property company and Mayor Odd Reinsfelt. In November 2003, it was announced that a compromise was reached <b>whereby</b> Fornebu Boligspar would give the lot free to Stabæk, in exchange for a lot nearby. Two weeks later the compromise was rejected by FB. A new compromise was announced on 29 June 2004, <b>whereby</b> FB would give 50 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and a lot free to Stabæk in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium.

5|$|Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes, Wagiman coverbs and {{nominals}} often undergo reduplication, <b>whereby</b> a part, or {{often the}} entirety of the root, is repeated. Reduplication can convey a multitude of meanings. When coverbs are reduplicated, the resulting derived coverb may involve added meaning components such as iterativity, duration or habituality.|$|E
5|$|In 1442, Henry VI sanctioned an {{arrangement}} <b>whereby</b> {{the town was}} to pay the college £25 {{a year from the}} fee farm (a type of feudal tax) in exchange for decayed property, allegedly worth £30 a year, which the college could not afford to keep in repair. The arrangement was cancelled in 1450.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, <b>whereby</b> evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|In organic chemistry, SnCl2 {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} Stephen reduction, <b>whereby</b> a nitrile is reduced (via an imidoyl {{chloride}} salt) to an imine which is easily hydrolysed to an aldehyde.|$|E

5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, <b>whereby</b> an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; <b>whereby,</b> it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|The City of Omak's mayor–council {{government}} comprises a mayorwho {{also represents}} north-central Washington's separate economic development districtand a seven-member council. These positions, stipulated by the Omak City Code, {{are subject to}} at-large elections every two years, rather than by geographic subdivisions. Like most portions of the United States, government and laws are run {{by a series of}} ballot initiatives <b>whereby</b> citizens can pass or reject laws, referenda <b>whereby</b> citizens can approve or reject legislation already passed, and propositions where specific government agencies can propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people. Federally, Omak is part of Washington's 4th congressional district, represented by Republican Dan Newhouse, who was sworn in on January 3, 2015. The current mayor, Cindy Gagne, was first elected in 2000 as a councilwomen, and was appointed in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{complications}} {{arising out}} of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process <b>whereby</b> the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president.

5|$|Under {{the council}} of rulers, the {{elective}} monarchy system of Malaysia, Sultan Iskandar was elected on 9 February 1984 as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong, shortly before his predecessor's term expired on 26 April 1984. He succeeded the Sultan of Pahang as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong on 26 April. A royal investiture was held shortly after that, in which he donned the traditional suit of the Agong, <b>whereby</b> he was officially installed. Sultan Iskandar served in the capacity as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong until 1989, <b>whereby</b> the Sultan of Perak succeeded him. As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Iskandar was automatically designated under constitutional provisions as the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, holding the rank of the Marshal of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, Admiral of the Fleet of the Royal Malaysian Navy and Field Marshal of the Army.|$|E
5|$|Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis {{wrote the}} scripts for Blackadder episodes {{separately}} using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts {{for each other}} to add or remove jokes and dialogue.

5|$|A {{circular}} permutation is {{a relationship}} between proteins <b>whereby</b> the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.|$|E
5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period <b>whereby</b> material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, <b>whereby</b> research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|After Zobel {{arrived at}} the Engineering Department of AT he used his {{mathematical}} skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters {{now known as the}} image method <b>whereby</b> the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.|$|E
5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, <b>whereby</b> his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, <b>whereby</b> a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's {{reputation}} for directorial profligacy—notably with the critically acclaimed Reds (1981), {{did not sit}} well with Disney. As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement <b>whereby</b> any budget overruns on Dick Tracy would be deducted from Beatty's fee as producer, director, and star. Beatty and regular collaborator Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue but lost a Writers Guild arbitration and did not receive screen credit.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel {{is used as}} an {{ingredient}} in Chateaubriand sauce, which is sometimes used {{in the preparation of}} Chateaubriand steak. The butter is used in the last stage of the sauce's preparation, <b>whereby</b> after the sauce is strained, it is finished with Beurre Maître d'Hôtel. Chopped tarragon may also be added to the sauce during this last preparation stage.|$|E
