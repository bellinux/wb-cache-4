5|$|The Experienced English Housekeeper was {{the first}} book to contain a recipe for what became the classic <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> {{complete}} with marzipan and royal icing.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its practicality, departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience. It introduced the first known recipe for a <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> covered in marzipan and royal icing, and is an early use of barbecue. The book remains a reference for cookery writers.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Bonfire {{shifted to}} a wedding-cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks. The {{structure}} was built around a fortified centerpole, made from two telephone poles. Although tradition stated that if Bonfire burned through midnight A would win the following day's game, {{with the introduction of}} the <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> design Bonfire began to fall quickly, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Wedding cakes come {{in several}} types, such as {{traditional}} <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes,</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes</b> based on flavor, smaller cakes or individual cakes, frosted cakes, and cupcakes. Traditional <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes</b> are white, including decoration and icing varieties such as buttercream, almond. etc. Wedding cakes based on flavor include chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. Smaller cakes or individual cakes {{can be more}} efficient in terms of price. Frosted cakes are popular due to {{the large amount of}} cream.|$|R

5|$|The mosque's {{adjoining}} large, round blue-and-white minaret (built in 1675) {{resembles a}} <b>wedding</b> <b>cake,</b> {{with a wide}} base similar to a ship's funnel. Built of coral stones, it is braced with metal strips. The minaret {{is surrounded by a}} graveyard with carved coral tombstones distinguishing males, females, sultans and their families. Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's have pointed tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. For family members, small mausoleums with intricately-decorated stone walls were built.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{classify}} {{the falls}} at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series}} of small steps, forming waterfalls that are said to resemble a <b>wedding</b> <b>cake.</b> Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is grey sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a marriage license on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an affidavit from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age.

5|$|Tangled Ever After is set {{six months}} after the events of the {{original}} movie. In the short, Pascal and Maximus are ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn Rider's wedding. When Maximus suffers a reaction from one of the flower petals Pascal is sprinkling along the aisle, Maximus sneezes and the rings are propelled off the pillow on which he is carrying the rings; the fly through a window in the chapel and into the city streets. Pascal and Maximus discreetly sneak out of the chapel to retrieve them in time for Rapunzel and Flynn to exchange them. Pascal and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves. Completely soiled, Pascal and Maximus finally return to the chapel and return the rings, only to cause the <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> to roll out the door.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> had {{a strong}} British floral theme, using {{elements}} of the Joseph Lambeth technique.

5000|$|Rolled fondant, fondant icing, or pettinice, {{which is}} not the same {{material}} as poured fondant, is commonly used to decorate <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes.</b> Although <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes</b> are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, fondant is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled fondant includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. It can also be made using powdered sugar and melted marshmallows. Rolled fondant is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake.|$|R

After this divorce, Koizumi never married again, saying that divorce consumed ten times more energy than marriage.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the soundboards of both {{northern}} and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes {{two or three}} in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were {{a throwback to the}} rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved integrally as part of the soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted <b>wedding</b> <b>cake.</b> In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker's initials.|$|E
25|$|Mobutu was infamous for embezzling the {{equivalent}} of billions of US dollars from his country. According to the most conservative estimates, he stole US$4–5billion from his country, and some sources put the figure as high as US$15billion. According to Mobutu's ex-son-in-law, Pierre Janssen—the ex-husband of Mobutu's daughter Yaki—Mobutu had no concern {{for the cost of}} the expensive gifts he gave away to his cronies. Janssen married Yaki in a lavish ceremony that included three orchestras, a US$65,000 <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> and a giant fireworks display. Yaki wore a US$70,000 wedding gown and US$3million worth of jewels.

40|$|Vertically aligned, highly ordered, {{large area}} arrays of {{nanostructures}} are important {{building blocks for}} multifunctional devices. Here, ZnO nanorod arrays are selectively synthesized on Si substrates by a solution method within patterns created by nanoimprint lithography. The growth modes of two dimensional nucleation-driven <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes</b> and screw dislocation-driven spirals are inferred to determine the top end morphologies of the nanorods. Sub-bandgap photoluminescence of the nanorods is greatly enhanced by the manipulation of the hydrogen donors via a post-growth thermal treatment. Lasing behavior is facilitated in the nanorods with faceted top ends formed from <b>wedding</b> <b>cakes</b> growth mode. This work demonstrates the control of morphologies of oxide nanostructures {{in a large scale}} and the optimization of the optical performance...|$|R

25|$|Cora Lansquenet was {{an artist}} and {{collector}} of paintings from local sales. Niece Susan Banks, heir to Cora's property, goes to her cottage to clear up the possessions and prepare them for auction, {{on the day of}} the inquest into Cora's murder. Miss Gilchrist claims that Cora always painted from life, yet Susan finds one quite recent painting featuring a pier that was destroyed in the war, a view that has been published on picture postcards. The next day, after Cora's funeral, art critic Alexander Guthrie, arrives to look through Mrs Lansquenet's recent purchases as previously scheduled. He finds nothing of any value there. That evening, Miss Gilchrist is poisoned by arsenic in a slice of <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> apparently sent to her through the post. She ate just a small portion of it, which saved her. Inspector Morton investigates the Lansquenet murder along with Poirot.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweetness}} of wines {{is determined by}} the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she turned her head to the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced <b>wedding</b> <b>cake</b> to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
