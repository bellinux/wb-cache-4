5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, <b>word</b> <b>repetition,</b> and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

Analyses of 10 task-oriented Japanese dialogues reveal a difference between <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> and error repairs for the data involving cut-off in first tokens; in both types of disfluencies, the final phoneme of the first token is considerably prolonged, but the degree of the prolongation is much greater in <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> than in error repairs. These results support our view that prolonged first tokens in <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> are a product of a process under the speaker’s control or intention. 1...|$|R

40|$|Disfluencies, when {{present in}} speech signal, can make {{syntactic}} parsing difficult. This difficulty is increased when machines {{are involved in}} communication and when speech devices rely on automatic speech recognition techniques. In order to improve automatic speech parsing and thus speech comprehension, methods have been proposed to filter disfluencies out from the speech signal. Attempts {{have been made to}} use prosodic parameters to improve such a filtering. However, before introducing prosodic parameters into automatic speech recognition processes, {{it would be useful to}} investigate whether disfluencies can be characterized in a prosodic way and whether their prosodic cues would be representative enough to be used in automatic systems. The aim of this study was to examine to which extent prosodic parameters would be able to characterize disfluencies in French. <b>Word</b> <b>repetitions,</b> filled and silent pauses and speech repairs were described in a prosodic way using statistical analyses of their prosodic parameters.

We also analyze the <b>repetition</b> <b>word</b> error rate for dif-ferent acoustic and language models in the Fisher conversa-tional speech corpus. The classifier approach is not promis-ing on recognizer output and generates {{a high degree of}} false alarms. The multiword approach to modeling the most fre-quent function <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> results in an absolute RWER reduction of 1. 26 % and a significant absolute WER reduc-tion of 2. 0 % on already well trained acoustic and language models.

Because of this, FOXP2 has been dubbed the [...] "language gene". People with this mutation also experience symptoms not related to language (not surprisingly, as FOXP2 is known to affect development {{in other parts of the}} body as well).

50|$|In addition, {{in spite}} of some {{research}} results indicating that MIT can activate regions potentially responsible for language processing in aphasic patients’ right hemisphere, some studies obtain completely opposite results.

Contrarily, they observed activation in patients’ right hemisphere when patients underwent <b>word</b> <b>repetition</b> tasks without MIT; they interpreted the right hemispheric activation as the persistence of aphasia, instead of cortical reorganization. Unfortunately, these currently conflicting research results demonstrate that the underlying mechanism of music therapy remains unclear.

50|$|Fox {{is perhaps}} best known for his {{translation}} into English of the Torah. His translation is heavily influenced by the principles of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig. Buber in 1962 completed their translation of the Hebrew Bible into German. Fox co-translated their Scripture and Translation into English with Lawrence Rosenwald of Wellesley College (Weissbort and Eysteinsson 562). The main guiding principle of Fox's work is that the aural aspects of the Hebrew text should be translated as closely as possible. Instances of Hebrew word play, puns, <b>word</b> <b>repetition,</b> alliteration, and other literary devices of sound are echoed in English and, as with Buber-Rosenzweig, the text is printed in linear, not paragraph, fashion. He has argued for the superiority of Biblical translations that preserve or reflect such Hebrew forms, and pushes English farther than does Robert Alter, whose translations are motivated by a similar appreciation of the character of the Hebrew original.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{segmentation}} skills are language-specific, making it difficult to segment continuous speech in an unfamiliar language into its component words. Here we present the first study capturing the delay in segmentation and recognition in the foreign listener using ERPs. We compared the ability of Dutch adults and of English adults without knowledge of Dutch (‘foreign listeners’) to segment familiarized words from continuous Dutch speech. We used the known effect of repetition on the event-related potential (ERP) as an index of recognition of words in continuous speech. Our results show that <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> in isolation are recognized with equivalent facility by native and foreign listeners, but <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> in continuous speech are not. First, words familiarized in isolation are recognized faster by native than by foreign listeners when they are repeated in continuous speech. Second, when words that have previously been heard only in a continuous-speech context re-occur in continuous speech, the repetition is detected by native listeners, but is not detected by foreign listeners. A preceding speech context facilitates word recognition for native listeners, but delays or even inhibits word recognition for foreign listeners. We propose that the apparent difference in segmentation rate between native and foreign listeners is grounded in the difference in language-specific skills available to the listeners...|$|R
40|$|The {{criterion}} of 3 % of stuttered disfluencies – (part-) <b>word</b> <b>repetitions,</b> sound prolongations and blocks – is often suggested to diagnose the stuttering in children (e. g., Boey et al., 2007; Yairi & Ambrose, 2005). There is a long-lasting debate among scholars about {{the relevance of}} considering monosyllabic <b>word</b> <b>repetitions</b> as stuttered disfluencies, given their high frequency in typically developing children (e. g., Howell, 2013; Wingate, 2001). Yet, these are the prime characteristics that prompt identification of early stuttering by parents (Yairi & Ambrose, 2013). Nevertheless, very few normative data exist concerning the disfluencies occurring in the speech of normally fluent children (Tumanova et al., 2014), and none exist in French.

Therefore, the original anomia model, which theorized that damage occurred {{on the surface of the}} brain in the grey matter was debunked, and it was found that the damage was in the white matter deeper in the brain, on the left hemisphere. More specifically, the damage was in a part of the nerve tract called the arcuate fasciculus, for which the mechanism of action is unknown, though it is known to connect the posterior (back) of the brain to the anterior (front) and vice versa.|$|E
