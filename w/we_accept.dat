5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
25|$|They {{are worthy}} of {{acceptance}} {{for the sake of}} the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{has been}} argued that it must be {{referring}} to people associated to the image's cult instead of deportees. Diana Edelman has pointed at the serious chronological difficulties that arise when <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> that the Jews returned during the reign of Cyrus.|$|E
30|$|For {{this special}} issue we {{received}} 23 submissions of which <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> nine. All papers were peer reviewed by multiple reviewers. We summarize the papers accepted for the special issue as follows.|$|R
30|$|In our clinic, <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the {{challenge}} and designed a protocol by which patients were sterilised {{without the use of}} any anaesthesia, including even local anaesthesia. The first results are presented in this paper.|$|R
60|$|Three natives {{volunteered to}} go with us to Tahiti, where we thought it likely {{that we should be}} able to procure a {{sufficient}} crew of sailors to man our vessel; so <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> their offer gladly.|$|R
25|$|Personal responsibility, self-reliance, {{and mastery}} – <b>We</b> <b>accept</b> {{that we are}} the masters of our own destiny. We make {{decisions}} and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.|$|E
25|$|The same Greek word neaniskos (young man) {{is used in}} both Secret Mark and at Mark 14:51. If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> Helmut Koester's {{theory that}} the {{canonical}} Mark is a revision of Secret Mark, another explanation is possible: namely, that the ancient editor who deleted an earlier encounter of Jesus with such {{a young man in}} a cloth, then added this incident also involving a young man during Jesus' arrest.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> this theory, the {{emergence}} of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve. The problem is that words are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have {{found it difficult to}} explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.|$|E
3000|$|... c. For this separation, the {{computed}} average likelihoods satisfied Eq. (1), and then, <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the separation. In {{the third}} stage, we estimated {{the dimensions of}} the affine spaces for the separated trajectories shown in Fig. 1 [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This {{is better}} than dining at the [...] "Sarcophagus,"' thinks I to myself, at which Club Wagley and I had {{intended}} to take our meal; and so <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the kindly invitation, whence arose afterwards a considerable intimacy.|$|R
60|$|In the chimney-seats sat a young mule-driver, who {{had left}} his two mules {{at the door of}} the inn, and {{opposite}} him an elderly stout man. They got down and offered us the seats of honour, which <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> with due courtesy.|$|R
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> pains {{as special}} qualia known {{absolutely}} but exclusively by the solitary minds that perceive them, {{this may be}} taken to ground a Cartesian view {{of the self and}} consciousness. Our consciousness, of pains anyway, would seem unassailable. Against this, one might acknowledge the absolute fact of one's own pain, but claim skepticism about the existence of anyone else's pains. Alternatively, one might take a behaviorist line and claim that our pains are merely neurological stimulations accompanied by a disposition to behave.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} from Hammond & Anderson {{that the first}} {{printing}} appeared on March 1, 1938. A library copy of the third printing has been seen with a check-out date of November 28, 1938. If <b>we</b> <b>accept,</b> then, that the first edition consisted of multiple runs on the evidence of emendations to the text block, the most surprising fact arising out of the dating {{is that the first}} three printings appeared within nine months of each other. It is not known whether a planned larger, single run was shortened and broken up for the corrections, or whether demand was simply strong enough to warrant new runs with corrections made opportunistically.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} birthdate of Plato is not known. Based {{on ancient}} sources, most modern scholars estimate that Plato was born between 428 and 427 BC. The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his Chronicles that Plato {{was born in}} the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day. According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> Neanthes' version, Plato was younger than Isocrates by six years, and therefore he {{was born in the}} second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC).|$|E
3000|$|... b. For this result, we {{computed}} {{the average}} likelihoods for the affine spaces before/after separation and obtained the results 5.63 × 10 − 7 and 8.11 × 10 − 5, respectively. Since these values satisfied the inequality in Eq. (1), <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the separation.|$|R
30|$|We are {{grateful}} to Prof. Marianne Klemun (Vienna, Austria) and to three anonymous reviewers for their positive criticism and for various suggestions to improve the manuscript. <b>We</b> <b>accepted</b> their suggestions; however, the responsibility for all errors remains ours. G. T. acknowledges OTKA project NK 83400 for funding.|$|R
60|$|A second {{reference}} paper (for we required always two) was sent down into Norfolk, and was duly received back by post. This, likewise, was satisfactorily answered in every respect. Our forms were all complied with; <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the proposal, and the premium {{for one year}} was paid.|$|R
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> {{the fact}} that they were above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
500|$|Phan {{was later}} {{reported}} to have simply retorted, [...] "If anyone carves up my brother, remember to send {{me some of the}} soup". However, he held no illusions about the prospect of successfully driving out the French, stating [...] "It is our destiny. <b>We</b> <b>accept</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|William Shatner said: [...] "There is a mythological {{component}} , {{especially with}} science fiction. It's {{people looking for}} answers – and science fiction offers to explain the inexplicable, the same as religion tends to do... If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> the premise {{that it has a}} mythological element, then all the stuff about going out into space and meeting new life – trying to explain it and put a human element to it – it's a hopeful vision. All these things offer hope and imaginative solutions for the future." ...|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{mentioned}} indices, <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the model, despite a significant Chi square value (χ 2 (173) =  519.521, p <  0.05). In fact, for models with 400 cases or more, the Chi square is almost always statistically significant (Kenny 2014). Thus, in such cases, other goodness-of-fit indexes are recommended.|$|R
40|$|The bending of {{an elastic}} three-layer plate on an elastic {{foundation}} was considered. To describe the kinematics of the bearing layers <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> {{the hypothesis of}} Kirchhoff. Reaction of foundation was described on Winkler's model. On the contour of the plate we assume a rigid diaphragm that prevents a relative shift of layers. ?????????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?????????. ??? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ???????? ????????. ??????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????. ?? ??????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????, ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????...|$|R
40|$|Abstract】To review {{long-term}} respiratory {{effects of}} mustard gas on Iranian veterans having undergone Iraq-Iran war. Electronic databases of Scopus, Medline, ISI, IranMedex, and Irandoc sites were searched. <b>We</b> <b>accepted</b> {{articles published in}} scientific journals as a quality criterion. The main pathogenic factors are free radical mediators. Preva-lence of pulmonary involvement is approximately 42. 5...|$|R
500|$|... "There's Got to Be a Way" [...] is an R-pop music {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, lasting for a duration for four minutes and 52 seconds. The theme of social activism {{can be heard}} in the lyrics [...] "There’s got to be a way / to connect this world today." [...] The song begins with Carey publicly denouncing the existence of poverty and racism in the world, and she uses the bridge to shift the lyrics towards an uplifting and aspirational tone. Carey suggests we should be more tolerant of each other and not resort so readily to war in the lyrics [...] "Couldn't <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> each other / Can't we make ourselves aware." ...|$|E
500|$|Having fallen foul of the censors {{with some}} of their earlier films, Hammer had an {{informal}} agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting to the BBFC for comment. When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, [...] "I must warn you at this stage that, while <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> this story in principle for the ‘X’ category, we could not certificate, even in that category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences”. The BBFC were particularly concerned with {{the violence in the}} scenes where Carroon escapes from hospital and with how graphic the depiction of Caroon's transformation into the alien creature would be.|$|E
500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{also argued}} that [...] "a person's {{interest}} in retaining his American citizenship is surely an aspect of 'liberty' of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law" [...] and that [...] "due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met" [...] in Terrazas's case or others like it. [...] Additionally, Stevens felt that Congress had not adequately addressed the question of specific intent to relinquish citizenship. [...] "Since <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> dual citizenship," [...] he wrote, [...] "taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen. [...] Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship." ...|$|E
40|$|In this didactic article a {{systematic}} review of Köppen's climatic classification is given. The {{aim is to}} accept this most rational and quantitative classification of climates widely accepted all over the world. Like in all other languages the present Croatian terminology is confused. This {{is the reason why}} <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> the original Köppen's terms...|$|R
6000|$|Earl {{picked up}} a small stick from the {{fireplace}} and brought out his pocket-knife. He always {{had to go to}} whittling when he wanted to do some hard thinking. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>accepted</b> Uncle Foster's invitation to come to San Francisco, there would be no turning back," [...] he remarked, after a moment of silence.|$|R
30|$|We {{received}} 30 submissions {{of which}} <b>we</b> eventually <b>accepted</b> 17 for publication.|$|R
500|$|In Freaks, {{director}} Tod Browning of Dracula fame helms {{a picture}} that depicts a traveling circus populated {{by a group of}} deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including [...] "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'". There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people. But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant [...] "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> her, <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> her." [...] Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak. Although, circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen. Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the [...] "living torso" [...] lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as [...] "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", [...] "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and [...] "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?" [...] Surprisingly, given its reaction to Frankenstein, the state of Kansas objected to nothing in Freaks. However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales. The film later became a cult classic spurred by midnight movie showings, but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.|$|E
500|$|Many {{state legislators}} also seemed unsure {{about whether to}} support the Stanley plan. A press poll of the state House Appropriations Committee showed an 8-to-7 split against the plan, with two members undecided. Support for Stanley's plan came almost {{exclusively}} from the Southside and counties around it, the Tidewater counties, and portions of Southwest Virginia. Much {{of the lack of}} support focused on whether the plan would actually pass court muster as well as halt desegregation. [...] Delegate James McIlhany Thomson, an ardent segregationist, said he believed the Stanley plan would not pass without a pupil assignment program. But on August 24, Garland Gray (whose own position had moved rightward) abandoned support for the pupil assignment plan because it permitted limited integration. Governor Stanley, however, was adamant that the Assembly enact his legislative program implementing [...] "massive resistance." [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> admission of one Negro child into a white school, it's all over," [...] he said on August 24.|$|E
500|$|Psycho-Pass further {{suggests}} {{that the price of}} living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as <b>we</b> <b>accept</b> that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is [...] "fear" [...] as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize him for what he actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> <b>accepted</b> 10 {{papers that}} will be {{presented}} within the workshop. We {{would like to thank}} the authors for their contributions and the organizers of Pervasive 2007 for hosting Permid 2007. We look forward to the workshop providing a rich environment for academia and industry to foster active collaboration in the area of mobile interactions with the real world...|$|R
6000|$|There is much {{mystery in}} the matter, despite Gregorovius's {{assertion}} to the contrary--mystery which mere assertion will not dissipate. This conclusion, however, {{it is fair}} to draw: if, on Capello's evidence, <b>we</b> are to <b>accept</b> it that Cesare Borgia is {{responsible for the death of}} Alfonso of Aragon, then, on the same evidence, <b>we</b> must <b>accept</b> the motive as well as the deed. <b>We</b> must <b>accept</b> as equally exact his thrice-repeated statement in letters to the Senate that the prince had planned Cesare's death by posting crossbow-men to shoot him.(1) ...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>accepted</b> this {{challenge}} {{and now we}} are presenting to the international adhesion community the Applied Adhesion Science. The journal focuses on practical applications of adhesives, with special emphasis in fields such as oil, aerospace and biomedical. Topics on problems related to the phenomena of adhesion and the application of adhesive materials are welcome, especially in biomedical areas such as adhesive dentistry.|$|R
