5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for the Israelis {{although}} the wake <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> <b>and</b> Laskov considered that his men could not hold {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of the Israelis.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} {{improving}} over the United Kingdom and Normandy, Hausser's preparations for his counter stroke came under continual harassment from Allied aircraft and artillery fire, delaying {{the start of}} the attack to the afternoon. From the number of German reinforcements arriving in the VIII Corps sector and aerial reconnaissance, O'Connor suspected that the Germans were organising a counter-stroke. XXX Corps was still some way to the north, leaving the VIII Corps right flank vulnerable, O'Connor postponed attacks by I Corps and ordered VIII Corps onto the defensive. Dempsey, privy to ULTRA decrypts of intercepted German signal traffic, knew the counter-attack <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> approved O'Connor's precautions. VIII Corps began to reorganise to meet the attack. Supply echelons for Hausser's divisions were located in the Évrecy–Noyers-Bocage–Villers-Bocage area and were the focus of RAF fighter-bomber attention throughout the morning and early afternoon; the RAF claimed the destruction of over 200 vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The pig {{was moving}} its ears. Since the cat saw it, it {{thought it was}} a mouse and in a rush jumped there. The pig was very frightened and, {{emitting}} loud shouts, ran away to the forest. The wolf, the hare and the fox thought that a great animal or something <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and,</b> one running faster than the other, they ran away. All the ram's meat was left to the cat. For seven days the cat ate, ate until it was full the spoils of the wolf and the fox.|$|E
25|$|In November 1915, the British {{military}} hero Field Marshal Lord Kitchener {{toured the}} Dardanelles {{as part of}} his review of the Middle Eastern theatre of operations. After two hours at Anzac Cove, he instructed Lt General Birdwood, the Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to begin planning to evacuate the Peninsula. Winter <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> already too many soldiers were being taken sick and even dying of hypothermia and frostbite, while the Turks had been stubbornly holding their ground. Retreat made sense, aside from just one problem: once the Turks figured out the troops were pulling back, the retreat would very quickly become a bloodbath.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} this information, Captain Horve {{had several}} personal telephone conversation with Rear admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen, the Commander of the 2nd Naval District, {{who told him}} that he had ordered the navy's ships in Bergen to open fire at any and all foreign warships that might try to force their way into that port. The rear admiral gave him permission to use his own judgement in the coming hours. The conversation left Horve in no doubt that war <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> he therefore ordered his ship to be made ready for war, guards to be posted, all leaves to be cancelled and the lights on the ship and in the harbour area to be blacked out.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2001 vintage, over 1.1 {{million cases}} of Beaujolais wine (most of it Beaujolais Nouveau) {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} or distilled due to lackluster sale {{as part of a}} consumer backlash against the popularity of Beaujolais Nouveau. French wine critic François Mauss claimed, in an interview given to a local newspaper Lyon Mag, that the reason for the backlash was the poor quality of Beaujolais Nouveau that had flooded the market in recent decades. He claimed that Beaujolais producers had long ignored the warning signs that such a backlash <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> continued to produce what Mauss termed vin de merde (shit wine). This triggered an outcry among Beaujolais producers followed by an association of 56 cooperative producers filing a lawsuit against the Lyon Mag for publishing Mauss' comments.|$|E
25|$|The {{transports}} {{carrying the}} Union soldiers arrived that evening. Initially, Butler thought that by exploding the Louisiana and starting the bombardment without the army, Porter {{had given the}} Confederates warning that the Union assault <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> would therefore have time to contest the landings. However he was convinced to land a reconnaissance party to determine if an attack was still feasible. The landings started Christmas morning, with Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames' division {{the first to be}} ashore, while the navy continued bombarding the fort. The Union troops captured a battery protecting the beach north of Fort Fisher, and accepted the surrender of the 4th and 8th North Carolina Junior Reserve battalions, which had been cut off by the Union landings. After setting up a defensive line, Ames sent the brigade of N. Martin Curtis towards the fort to see if it could be attacked. Curtis found the land wall lightly defended and was prepared to attack, but was prevented from doing so by Ames. Butler was convinced that the fort was undamaged and too strong for an assault; he had also received word that Hoke's division was a few miles north of the fort, and another storm was forming in the area. All this convinced him to halt the landings and order the troops on the beach to return to the ships; the entire Union fleet then returned to Hampton Roads.|$|E

500|$|News of de Barras' sailing reached New York on August 28, where Graves, Clinton, and Hood {{were meeting}} to discuss the {{possibility}} of making {{an attack on the}} French fleet in Newport, since the French army was no longer there to defend it.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West considered Pam's {{speech to}} be [...] "a terrific payoff {{for those of}} us invested (some might say too much) in the Jim-Pam-Karen love triangle."

[...] IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Beach Games" [...] 8.5/10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. Like West, he highlighted Stanley for praise, and also liked Helms being trapped on the lake. Fickett concluded that [...] "while this episode's closing scene doesn't have the impact of Jim telling Pam {{he was in love with}} her at the end of Season 2, it is one of those long awaited moments that we knew <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> <b>And</b> Jenna Fischer, as Pam, handles it perfectly.

500|$|In Greece, a {{large log}} was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would go out into the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E
500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> <b>and</b> if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else could they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E
