2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{experiments}} performed on the show, many have not gone as expected. Sometimes, these mishaps have rendered the test equipment unusable, such as when the rocket in the [...] "Rocket Car Revisit" [...] exploded on ignition. Others have even resulted in minor injuries to the personnel involved with the show, such as when Tory banged his knee falling off a fire tower; the fall was expected and prepared for using a safety harness, but him injuring his knee <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>foreseen.</b> The most common injuries come from moving safety equipment which has led to stitches and at least four broken fingers. [...] These kinds of incidents are usually included in the broadcast program, with little other media attention, but sometimes things fail in more spectacular and news-worthy ways.|$|E
2500|$|Article One, Section 8, of the United States Constitution {{established}} a [...] "District... become {{the seat of}} the government of the United States..." [...] The Residence Act of 1790 (as amended), established this district and gave to the President of the United States the authority to fix the location of the site somewhere along the Potomac River. President George Washington chose the current site of the city in 1791, and it was surveyed later that year. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>foreseen</b> that the city of Washington would be coterminous with the District of Columbia, and Washington set the northern boundary of the city roughly where Pennsylvania Avenue is today. Washington chose Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant to plan the new city. Although unnamed at the time, Pennsylvania Avenue was designed in the L'Enfant plan as a critical thoroughfare for bringing existing roads {{into the heart of the}} new city. It was also designed to link the [...] "president's palace" [...] with the Capitol building planned for Jenkin's Hill (now Capitol Hill).|$|E
2500|$|Due to the Four-Power Occupation Agreements for Berlin, {{in which}} the {{long-term}} division of Germany and Berlin (the partition of Germany into two German states; and Berlin partitioned into two principal zones of occupation, West Berlin and East Berlin) <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>foreseen,</b> the DR operated the long-haul railway service (Fernverkehr) and barge canals in both East and West Berlin throughout {{the years of the}} Cold War (and also after the reunification of Germany) until the merger of the DR and DB in January 1994. [...] This led to unique situations due to the occupied status of West Berlin and the presence of the DR there. [...] For example, there were Bahnpolizei (railway police) employed by the DR in their West Berlin railway stations who were controlled by the GDR Interior Ministry, although the three Western Allies (the United States, Great Britain and France) never officially recognized the authority of the GDR government in the Soviet (Eastern) sector of Berlin, let alone in West Berlin. [...] For this reason, the West Berlin Polizei had separate patrols who were empowered to maintain law and order in the West Berlin railway stations.|$|E

And Mr Dorrit's daughter that day began, in earnest, her competition with that woman not present; and began it so well that Mr Dorrit could all but have taken his affidavit, if required, that Mrs Sparkler had all her life been lying at full length {{in the lap of}} luxury, and had never heard of such a rough word in the English tongue as Marshalsea.|$|E

60|$|This court, {{which in}} its {{constitution}} {{seems not to}} have had sufficiently in view the necessities of the people for whose relief it was intended, and was, or thought itself, bound in some instances to too strict an adherence to the forms and rules of English practice, in others was framed upon principles perhaps too remote from the constitution of English tribunals. By the usual course of English practice, the far greater part of the redress to be obtained against oppressions of power is by process in the nature of civil actions. In these a trial by jury is a necessary part, with regard to the finding the offence and to the assessment of the damages. Both these were in the charter of justice left entirely to the judges. It was presumed, and not wholly without reason, that the British subjects were liable to fall into factions and combinations, in order to support themselves in the abuses of an authority of which every man might in his turn become a sharer. And with regard to the natives, it was presumed (perhaps a little too hastily) that they were not capable of sharing in the functions of jurors. But it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>foreseen</b> that the judges were also liable to be engaged in the factions of the settlement,--and if they should ever happen to be so engaged, that the native people were then without that remedy which obviously lay in the chance that the court and jury, though both liable to bias, might not easily unite in the same identical act of injustice. Your Committee, on full inquiry, are of opinion that the use of juries is neither impracticable nor dangerous in Bengal.|$|E

50|$|One {{outcome that}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>foreseen</b> {{as a result}} of the closure of many branch lines in the 1960s was the loss of public access to those rights of way {{established}} by the various railway companies. Those structures of level ground upon which so much energy and labour was expended, could have been put to good use in the past, e.g. rapid transit routes. The loss of continuity in the system as a whole, means that what remains of these rail trackways are now the subject of competition between human power and motorised rapid transit solutions.|$|E
5000|$|The Second Relief Act, therefore, passed (1791) without {{changing}} the previous oath, or {{the name of}} Catholics.

So too did the oath annexed to the bill proposed in 1813, which from its length was styled the [...] "Theological Oath". Eventually, owing to the growing influence exercised by Daniel O'Connell and the Irish, Catholic Emancipation was granted without any tests at all in 1829.|$|E
