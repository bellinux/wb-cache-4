The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, the ATC200X got a {{complete}} redesign. The machine shared {{nothing in common}} with its predecessor than the name. It got an all new 199 cc four-stroke engine, <b>white</b> <b>plastics</b> which were notably sportier, longer suspension travel, and {{a complete}}ly resigned [...] "box" [...] frame, which was made of square tubing instead of round tubing for a significant strength increase. The ATC350X also got various updates, including <b>white</b> <b>plastics</b> and most notably a revised oil pickup point in the engine, to help reduce engine oil starvation when riding long wheelies.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom was predominantly <b>white</b> <b>plastic,</b> {{with dark}} red trim. It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, grooves {{on both sides}} of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use, and a 15-pin expansion port located on the unit's front panel for accessories.|$|E
25|$|Between 1945 and 1988, police {{officers}} in Taiwan wore khaki uniforms with khaki combination caps similar to those worn by naval officers, or with <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> helmets similar to the U.S. Navy Shore patrol. Critics noted the similarity to military uniforms, eventually leading to the revision of police uniforms in 1988.|$|E

The track ball enables users to scroll a page or document in any direction, including diagonally. Instead of mechanical buttons, the touch-sensitive topshell (mentioned below) and the pressure sensing trackball allow the mouse to detect which side is being touched or whether the trackball is being held in.|$|E
25|$|Value and {{discount}} {{retailers have}} seen a boom in sales since the recession {{at the start of}} 2009. Although there are several retailers with the same strategy as 99p Stores, such as independent businesses and smaller price-point retail chains such as Poundworld, 99p Stores' closest and largest rival in the sector is Poundland. The retailer has cited one of their main aims is to catch up with Poundland and their 223 stores as of August 2009. The retailer makes it a point of honour to undercut rival Poundland, whose £1 pack of 100 <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> cups contained 20 fewer (and cost a penny more) than the pack of 120 available at 99p Stores as of late 2007.|$|E

25|$|Electronic {{paper was}} first {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic {{on one side and}} positively charged <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.|$|E
25|$|Written {{messages}} on plastic slates {{can be used}} to convey complex messages with a low risk of misunderstanding. Slates are available in various sizes and are usually hard <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> with a matte finish, suitable for writing on with a pencil. They can be stored in various ways, but in a pocket or bungeed to the wrist are popular methods. Clipped to the diver by a lanyard is another method, but there is a greater risk of entanglement. Slates may be used to record information to be used on the dive, such as decompression schedules, to discuss matters of importance for which hand signals are not sufficient, and to record data collected during the dive. Waterproof paper wet-notes are a compact equivalent, and pre-printed waterproof data-sheets and clip-board are routinely used by scientific divers for recording observations.|$|E

[...] The white vehicle, described by Entertainment Weekly as a [...] "hover dress", features a central column {{to which the}} wearer is clamped by a safety harness, in turn covered by a <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> [...] "dress". The column also houses the batteries and other equipment. Six lifting fan units are mounted on booms in a hexagonal formation radiating {{from the top of}} the column, giving the device the ability to hover three feet above the ground. The dress was designed by TechHaus, the Haus of Gaga's technology branch, and it took them two years to create.|$|E

500|$|The song's segment in Magical Mystery Tour {{was shot}} mainly at RAF West Malling, {{an air force}} base near Maidstone in Kent, during the week {{beginning}} on 19 September. Described by Womack as [...] "the movie's hazy, psychedelic sequence", it features Harrison sitting on a pavement and playing a chalk-drawn keyboard. Dressed in a red suit, he is shown busking on a roadside; next to his keyboard are a <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> cup and a message written in chalk, reading: [...] "2 wives and kid to support". The depiction of Harrison, seated in the lotus position and seemingly zoned out, matched his public image as the most committed of the Beatles to Transcendental Meditation and Eastern philosophy.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, {{the tidal}} flow system was {{abandoned}} and the Albert Bridge was converted back to two-way traffic. A traffic island was {{installed on the}} south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it. In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large four-wheel drive cars (so-called Chelsea tractors), many of which were over the two-ton weight limit; it was estimated that one third of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit.

500|$|Chris Cunningham {{served as}} a model for a {{character}} in the novel Pattern Recognition (2003) by William Gibson, in which a fictitious music video director who puts [...] "robot girls in his video" [...] makes a clip characterized by the following words: [...] "No sci-fi kitsch for Damien. Dreamlike things in the dawn half-light, their small breasts gleaming, <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> shining faints as old marble", as a reference to [...] "All Is Full of Love". In 2004, similarities were noted between the design of the robots in the music video and those in the film I, Robot, raising accusations of plagiarism by fans. E! News contacted Cunningham and 20th Century Fox—the studio behind the film—but neither of them returned calls for comment. According to Tymon Smith of The Times, 2015 American film Chappie [...] "ends with a rip off" [...] of the music video. It also was an inspiration for the opening title sequence of the television series Westworld.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick {{searched for}} a project that he could film quickly on a small budget. He settled on A Clockwork Orange (1971) {{at the end of}} 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of Alex (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick had originally received a copy of Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on Dr. Strangelove, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. In 1969, the decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth was a more timely one; the New Hollywood movement was witnessing a great number of films that were centered around the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people, which no doubt influenced Kubrick in Baxter's opinion. [...] A Clockwork Orange was shot over the winter of 1970-1 on a budget of £2 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in the filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an [...] "acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy", and favored his [...] "rigorously symmetrical framing", which [...] "increased the beauty of his compositions". The film heavily features [...] "pop erotica" [...] of the period, including a giant <b>white</b> <b>plastic</b> set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a [...] "slightly futuristic" [...] look. McDowell's role in Lindsay Anderson's if.... (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable.|$|E
