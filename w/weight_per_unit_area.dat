50|$|In 1975 an American scientist, Jerome Pearson, reinvented {{the concept}} yet again, {{publishing}} his {{analysis in the}} journal Acta Astronautica. He designed a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator. The completed cable would be thickest at the geostationary orbit, where the tension was greatest, and would be narrowest at the tips {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear. He suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to 144,000 km, almost half the distance to the Moon as the lower section of the elevator was built. Without a large counterweight, the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way gravitational and centrifugal forces change with distance from Earth. His analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the Moon, wind and moving payloads up and down the cable. The weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of Space Shuttle trips, although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from asteroidal or lunar ore.|$|E

This linear ultrasonic motor uses a properly controlled ultrasonic standing wave to levitate and drive a slider.

The levitation and motion of the slider were observed. Assuming that the driving force was generated by the turbulent acoustic streaming in the boundary air layer next to the bottom surface of the slider, a theoretical model was developed. The calculated characteristics of this motor were found to agree quite well with the experimental results. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, guidelines for increasing the displacement and speed of the slider were obtained. It was found that increasing the stator vibration displacement, or decreasing the gradient of the stator vibration velocity and the <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>area</b> of the slider, led to an increase of the slider displacement.

Leaf decay rates are relatively slow (k 5 0. 008 day 21, for experiments lasting ca. 80 days), allowing leaf debris to be exported. In young stands (up to 3 years old), below ground detritus is less abundant (accounting for 5. 2 gN m 22 and 0. 2 gP m 22).

Nonwoven barrier materials are generally less expensive than woven and knitted barrier fabrics. However, disadvantages associated with their manufacturing techniques, such as uneven blending, regions with uneven area density etc., affect their performance as barrier materials. Nonwoven materials typically lack strength (tensile and bursting) unless densified or reinforced by a backing. Due to their structural characteristics, nonwovens also have challenges associated with their mechanical performance and thermal shrinkage when exposed to heat.

These experiments include measurements of selectivity as a function of transport distance along a terebellid (polychaete) tentacle, {{of the degree to which}} a food source can be depleted of the preferred particle type by a terebellid, of selectivity by spionids (polychaetes) having lost their tentacles, of selectivity by an ampharetid (polychaete) as a function of available particle types, and of "selectivity " by adhesive-coated microscope slides. A large component of mechanical selection is seen to be achieved at the point of particle pick-up. The first step of the heuristic model is particle contact by the tentacle. By appealing to the Delesse principle and to the results with adhesive-coated slides, the probability of particle contact is shown to be a function of particle size. On a per-particle basis, larger particles have a higher probability of being contacted by a tentacle than do smaller ones. The second step is the retention of the particle given that it has been contacted. It is suggested that the conditional (i. e., given contact) probability of such retention is a function of the adhesive strength of the mucus found on the tentacle and that it will depend on both particle <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> surface <b>area</b> and particle surface characteristics. In general, the conditional probability of retention will be a decreasing function of submerged particle <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> surface <b>area</b> An important deduction from this model is that size-selection in tentaculate deposit-feeders need have no morphological correlates; the lower the adhesive strength of the mucus, the greater will be the animal's selectivity for smaller, lighter particle...|$|R
