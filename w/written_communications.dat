5|$|Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled {{over the}} {{question}} of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and <b>written</b> <b>communications.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{documentation}} {{challenges the}} French assertions. The imperial records, <b>written</b> <b>communications</b> between Gian and Định, and {{the account of}} the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named Nguyen Thong support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of Huế and in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered the insurgents to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan of negotiating the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent the insurgents from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging the insurgents, rather than fomenting resistance.|$|E

Rees and Rose (as cited in [...] "References" [...] on page 9) claim neuroethics is a neologism that emerged only {{at the beginning of}} the 21st century, largely through the oral and <b>written</b> <b>communications</b> of ethicists and philosophers. [...] According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled [...] "Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn" [...] for the Perceptual and Motor Skills. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for Psychological Report, often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word [...] "neuroethics". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989). [...] Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991. [...] Writer William Safire is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as [...] "the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain".|$|E

Now the humble posture that he had necessarily adopted in his <b>written</b> <b>communications</b> with his royal master had become his real posture. The old servant, no matter how great and how brilliant, had become in reality what he had always played as on a stage: a servant who could be dismissed at will by his Sovereign. He had defended that royal prerogative because it had allowed him {{to carry out his}} immense will; now the absolute prerogative of the Emperor became what it has always been, the prerogative of the sovereign. Having crushed his parliamentary opponents, flattened and abused his ministers, and refused to allow himself to be bound by any loyalty, Bismarck had no ally left when he needed it. It was not his cabinet nor his parliamentary majority. He had made sure that it remained the sovereign's, {{and so it was that}} he fell because of a system that he preserved and bequeathed to the unstable young Emperor.|$|E
