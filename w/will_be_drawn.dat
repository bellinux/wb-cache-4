25|$|According to a meta-analysis, it was {{discovered}} that direct lobbying is used alongside grassroots lobbying. There is evidence that groups {{are much more likely to}} directly lobby previous allies rather than opponents. Allies are also directly lobbied if a counter lobby is brought to light. The results suggest that groups lobby in ways designed obtain the most influence for their view. When groups have strong ties to a legislator's district, those groups will use a combination of grassroots and direct lobbying, even if the legislator's original position does not support theirs, which may help groups expand their supportive coalitions. When strong district ties are not present, groups tend to rely on direct lobbying with committee allies, because they assume that their political friends <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> to participate with the lobbyist view.|$|E

The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If {{in any of the}} knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.|$|E

500|$|When a new {{grant of}} arms {{is to be}} made, it is granted through a Letters Patent. The Crown delegates all of this {{authority}} to the King of Arms, however before any letters can be issued they must have a warrant from the Earl Marshal agreeing to the granting of arms. This {{has been the case}} since 1673, when the authority of the Earl Marshal, which the heralds had challenged, was established by a royal declaration stating, among other things, that no patents of arms should be granted without his consent. This established the present system whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal, and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms. Firstly a petition is submitted, called a memorial, to the Earl Marshal. This memorial <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> up for the petitioner by an officer of arms, if it is felt that such a petition would be accepted.
