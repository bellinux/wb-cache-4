While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E

[...] She continued, [...] "They prefer to pay 50 million for <b>a</b> player <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> more <b>like</b> Güizinho" [...] Eventually, Güiza ended up being signed to Fenerbahçe.|$|R
60|$|It is a {{world of}} surprises. They fall, too, where one is least expecting them. When I {{introduced}} Sellers into the book, Charles Dudley Warner, who was writing the story with me, proposed a change of Seller's Christian name. Ten years before, in a remote corner of the West, he had come across a man named Eschol Sellers, and he thought that Eschol was just the right and fitting name for our Sellers, since it was odd and quaint and all that. I liked the idea, but I said that that man might turn up and object. But Warner said it couldn't happen; that he was doubtless dead by this time, a man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that couldn't live long; and be he dead or alive we must have the name, it was exactly the right one and we couldn't do without it. So the change was made. Warner's man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way. When the book had been out a week, a college-bred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal upholstery arrived in Hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a libel suit in his eye, and his name was Eschol Sellers! He had never heard of the other one, and had never been within a thousand miles of him. This damaged aristocrat's programme was quite definite and businesslike: the American Publishing Company must suppress the edition as far as printed, and change the name in the plates, or stand a suit for $10,000. He carried away the Company's promise and many apologies, and we changed the name back to Colonel Mulberry Sellers, in the plates. Apparently there is nothing that cannot happen. Even the existence of two unrelated men wearing the impossible name of Eschol Sellers is a possible thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, oh, Marilla, I {{really felt}} that I had tasted the {{bitterness}} of death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out alone," [...] she said mournfully that night. [...] "I thought how splendid {{it would have been}} if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--THEY have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon {{is going to be a}} minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh. He's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{started the}} next morning to call upon St. Leonard. Near to the house I {{encountered}} young Hopkins on a horse. He was waving a pitchfork over his head and reciting [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade." [...] The horse looked amused. He told me I should find [...] "the gov'nor" [...] up by the stables. St. Leonard is not an [...] "old man." [...] Dick must have seen him in a bad light. I should describe him as about the prime of life, a little older than myself, but nothing to speak of. Dick was right, however, in saying he was not like a farmer. To begin with, [...] "Hubert St. Leonard" [...] does not sound like a farmer. One can imagine a man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>like</b> that writing a book about farming, having theories on this subject. But in the ordinary course of nature things would not grow for him. He does not look like a farmer. One cannot say precisely what it is, but there is that about a farmer that tells you he is a farmer. The farmer has a way of leaning over a gate. There are not many ways of leaning over a gate. I have tried all I could think of, but it was never quite the right way. It has to be in the blood. A farmer has a way of standing on one leg and looking at a thing that isn't there. It sounds simple, but there is knack in it. The farmer is not surprised it is not there. He never expected it to be there. It {{is one of those things}} that ought to be, and is not. The farmer's life is full of such. Suffering reduced to a science is what the farmer stands for. All his life he is the good man struggling against adversity. Nothing his way comes right. This does not seem to be his planet. Providence means well, but she does not understand farming. She is doing her best, he supposes; that she is a born muddler is not her fault. If Providence could only step down for a month or two and take a few lessons in practical farming, things might be better; but this being out of the question there is nothing more to be said. From conversation with farmers one conjures up a picture of Providence as a well-intentioned amateur, put into a position for which she is utterly unsuited.|$|E

50|$|Between 1983 and {{the early}} 2000s {{a broad range of}} compact cameras were made by Nikon.

When someone holds <b>a</b> {{conversation}} <b>with</b> these two people at the same time, the appendage [...] "son" [...] would not need to be used; in that case, the genitive form of the father's name could be used like a nickname, although it is just as common in such cases to refer to people by their middle <b>names</b> (having <b>a</b> middle <b>name</b> being nowadays the general rule for people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> common <b>name</b> <b>like</b> 'Jón').|$|R
5000|$|The first Anglo-Saxon {{settlements}} in England {{were created by}} the invaders themselves.
