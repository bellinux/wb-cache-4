American men's team coach Phill Drobnick said [...] "The team watched {{it together and}} <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> two thumbs up, they {{did a great job}} and it was reaching out to a new audience for our sport, so that's always great for us too." [...] American team alternate Chris Plys said [...] "They didn't make a mockery of the sport, which is nice. Curling catches a lot of abuse." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{returning}} monsters, the Ice Warriors were not heavily redesigned. Gatiss insisted upon keeping {{the fundamentals of}} the original and Moffat explained that the original design was not well-known enough to put a new spin on it, and so Skaldak's shell is just a [...] "super-version of the original". Of the original design, Millennium FX's Neill Gorton said, [...] "My problem with the old ones is they had Lego hands and weird, spindly arms but a bulky body and these strange saddlebag hips, almost feminine. They had fur sticking out everywhere. So all of that together didn't suggest [...] "ice warriors." [...] They should be much beefier and stronger. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> more of a bodybuilder physique, changed the hands and styled the body {{to make it look}} more like armour-plating, even though it's reptilian." [...] The costume was made of flexible urethane rubber instead of the fibreglass like the original, as it would damage less easily and be more comfortable to wear. The costume was made to specially fit Spencer Wilding. Though only some of the Skaldak's real appearance was shown on-screen, Gorton stated that they created a full animatronic body.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

They called the game [...] "a wonderfully weird journey high on atmosphere, art direction, and creativity." [...] Psychonauts won PC Gamer USs 2005 [...] "Best Game You Didn't Play" [...] award. The editors wrote, [...] "Okay, look, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> an Editors' Choice award — that's your cue {{to run out}} right now and buy Tim Schafer's magnificent action/adventure game.

2500|$|The advert for the India-Pakistan {{match was}} made by a crew of ten people and {{completed}} in five days. The production crew consisted of members of Bubblewrap Films, an advertising agency in Mumbai, {{as well as two}} freelance music directors Vinayak Salvi and Rohan Utpat who were onboarded two days before the shoot. Salvi said, [...] "According to the brief, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> a Pakistani flavour, making it like a contemporary qawwali." [...] According to Utpat, they did not use subcontinent cricket terms like chauka (boundary) to make it [...] "a more universal emotion." [...] The director of Bubblewrap Films, Suresh Triveni said, [...] "We wanted a song that would make sense even without the video. So no cricketing terms were used. The song has strains of Sufi and qawwali in a Coke Studio style and the lyrics give the idea of a wanderer in search of the almighty." [...] The Star Sports' creative team came up with the [...] "Mauka" [...] idea while the lyrics for the jingle was penned by Vikas Dubey (also from Star Sports).|$|E

2500|$|At {{last they}} reached {{the base of the}} final tower. [...] "We stood," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> all kinds of {{pleasant}} names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, , [...] " [...] They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock couloir, which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: [...] "Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn." ...|$|E
