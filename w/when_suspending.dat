30|$|Nanoparticles {{constitute}} {{a great challenge}} for aquatic toxicity testing due to their highly dynamic behavior in aqueous suspension. As described above, various time-dependent transformation processes including agglomeration/aggregation, sedimentation and especially dissolution cause the exposure concentration to change during the test incubation. This affects the concentration–response relationships and ultimately the validity and reproducibility of aquatic toxicity tests with nanoparticles [38, 39]. Applying a short-term 2  h algal 14 C-assimilation test, Sørensen & Baun (2015) tested the hypothesis that a shortened exposure period reduces the influence of NP transformation processes on the toxicity outcome and, thus, increases the reproducibility of algal toxicity testing with silver nanoparticles (Ag nanoparticles). The hypothesis was rejected, based on the obtained EC 50 values for three different Ag nanoparticles, but the approach may be applicable for other types of nanoparticles. However, <b>when</b> <b>suspending</b> the Ag nanoparticles in media 24  h prior to the 2  h testing (aging, see “Using freshly prepared nanomaterial-suspensions may underestimate toxicity” section), {{a higher degree of}} reproducibility was obtained. Thus, shortened exposure duration may provide a toxicity snapshot at any given time upon suspension of nanoparticles in media and thereby assist to elucidate the role of the time-dependent NP behavior on toxicity and reproducibility in aquatic toxicity testing of nanoparticles exerting rapid toxic effects and/or dissolution.|$|E
40|$|Graft use in vaginal {{prolapse}} surgery {{has become}} more common secondary to high failure rates seen with traditional repairs. Mesh {{has been shown to}} be successful <b>when</b> <b>suspending</b> the upper portion of the vagina with sacralcolpopexy and its use vaginally is in an attempt to reproduce those results seen from the more invasive abdominal approach. A recent Cochrane review has supported its use in the anterior compartment vaginally as lower failure rates have been shown. Vaginal mesh “kits” have been developed in an attempt to make these surgeries less invasive, more standardized, and easier to perform. One of the problems that does seem to be emerging is the thought that, just because these procedures are now being produced in “kits”, they can be completed by any surgeon. This may not hold true, as these are still advanced techniques that require advanced pelvic surgery skills and, therefore, it is up to surgeons to also understand this and the limitations of these procedures. The current paper reviews the history of the development of mesh kits, the techniques utilized, and the data that have been published to date on results and complications, and recommendations on how to avoid these complications. Although initial studies are encouraging, more will need to be completed prior to the recommendations of general use of these kits in all prolapse patients. We need to have further investigation on proper patient selection, we must continue research on graft composition, and we must continue to develop techniques to minimize complications of needle passage or mesh placement. Even after we gain this knowledge, it will still require advanced surgical skills to complete these types of surgeries, and to help minimize complications and maximize results...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} new product {{development}} (NPD) teams to generate ideas and develop high-quality concepts for new products {{is a crucial}} determinant of NPD success. Although prior {{research in this area}} has developed various interventions to enhance the ability of teams to generate ideas, such interventions have limited impact on innovation management theory and practice. Partly, this is because of practical reasons: The interventions are often costly and impractical. However, there are also more fundamental, theoretical issues regarding these interventions: Knowledge of which interventions are effective in what situations is lacking. Even more importantly, there is no theory (or empirical evidence) about the effects of these interventions on the success of developing initial ideas into concepts. Together, this has caused the usefulness of these interventions for NPD teams to be uncertain at best. To remedy this situation, this study focuses on a costless and easy-to-implement intervention: suspending group debate. Suspending group debate refers to a team idea generation and concept development process in which groups debate a problem, ideas for solutions are generated individually, and these ideas are debated and developed into concepts collectively. The authors developed a new theory about the impact of suspending group debate on idea generation and on further concept development. Specifically, they argue that suspending group debate causes groups to generate a higher number of ideas, a higher number of original ideas, and a more diverse set of ideas, but that only the number of original ideas and the diversity of the set of ideas will translate into higher concept quality. The authors also developed new theory about <b>when</b> <b>suspending</b> group debate is especially effective. Specifically, they argue that suspending group debate is especially effective when at least one group member is low on extraversion. This theory is tested using an experimental design in which groups generated ideas and developed concepts for a specific organizational problem. Some groups suspend group debate, while others do not. Results show that suspending group debate indeed causes groups to generate a higher number of ideas, a higher number of original ideas, and a more diverse set of ideas. Importantly, results demonstrate that the effects of suspending group debate are more pronounced for groups with one or more group members that are low on extraversion. Furthermore, suspending group debate also affects concept quality, mediated by the number of original ideas and the diversity of ideas that groups generate (and thus not by the sheer number of ideas generated). Specifically, results show that both the diversity of the idea set as well as the number of original ideas positively influence the innovativeness of the final concept, while only the diversity of the idea set influences the comprehensiveness of the final concept...|$|E
