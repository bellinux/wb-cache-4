5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and <b>white</b> <b>socks,</b> believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn <b>white</b> <b>socks</b> with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and <b>white</b> <b>socks,</b> while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

5|$|Away colours {{have tended}} to be either white—often with black shorts—or a {{combination}} of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with <b>white</b> <b>socks.</b> For the 2007–08 season, the change strip was all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or {{in the event of a}} clash involving both red and white.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} season, the home kit reverted {{to the usual}} all-blue strip and the jersey currently has a white sash across it.

He felt {{the players in}} the new all-red would appear more intimidating than in the {{previous}} red shirts, white shorts and <b>white</b> <b>socks.</b> Liverpool lost in the semi-final to Internazionale. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing questionable Italian goals. In the 1965 FA Cup Final Hunt put Liverpool ahead in extra time. Leeds United's Billy Bremner equalised. St John then scored for a 2–1 first ever Liverpool FA Cup triumph. Defence of their League title ended in seventh place.|$|E

In 2016, they were ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £1.15billion ($1.66billion).|$|E
5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and <b>white</b> <b>socks.</b> The emblem on the shirts {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with <b>white</b> <b>socks</b> on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall <b>white</b> <b>socks.</b> Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E

5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue shorts and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and <b>white</b> <b>socks</b> for their away kit.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Aberdeen {{changed the}} black and gold colours to red and white, {{reflecting}} the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or <b>white</b> <b>socks</b> from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, {{similar to that of}} Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes {{on the left side of}} the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one-season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.|$|E

The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long beige trousers with a beige shirt, similar to the male students in the college section. College girls wear a beige blouse and a beige skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
