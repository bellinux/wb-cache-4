5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats.

Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E
