Lyrically, the track describes a house party, as mentioned in the opening lines [...] "It's our party, we can {{do what we want}} / It's our party, we can say what we want / It's our party, we can love who we want / We can kiss who we want / <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> how we want". It also makes several references to recreational drug use, including [...] "dancing with molly", using a slang term for ecstasy, and [...] "trying to get a line [...] in the bathroom". After initial confusion whether the former lyric was [...] "dancing with molly" [...] or [...] "dancing with Miley", Cyrus clarified that she was referring to ecstasy, commenting that [...] "if you’re aged ten it’s 'Miley', if you know what I'm talking about then you know. I just wanted it to be played on the radio and they’ve already had to edit it so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} African hip hop groups {{including}} Positive Black Soul, Daara J takes an activist stance. Faada Freddy states: [...] "We tell {{of peace and}} how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> together because {{there are lots of}} conflicts going on nowadays. We're here on behalf of the Africans to remind everybody that it shouldn't be like that. There's always a solution. Rather than fussing and fighting we'd better learn to live in peace and live together, because that's the only way to survive." [...] The group is especially focused on educating the world about Africa. Faada Freddy has also stressed the importance of understanding life on the continent: [...] "Nowadays people are tending to show the negative part of Africa but Africa is not only about AIDS, heartache, corruption and all that even though it exists just like everywhere else. But Africa has a lot to provide." [...] In the Senegalese election of 2000, Daara J were involved in editing speeches for political leaders and the promotion of that year's campaign against corruption.|$|E
2500|$|To assert this methodological {{character}} of eternal truths is not, of course, to deny their validity [...] To {{say that we}} assume the truth of abstraction because we wish to attain certain ends, is to subordinate theoretic 'truth' to a teleological implication; to say that, the assumption once made, its truth is 'proved' by its practical working [...] For {{the question of the}} 'practical' working of a truth will always ultimately be found to resolve itself into the question whether <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> by it.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{appearance}} on Meet the Press with other minor party candidates in October 1976, LaRouche predicted monetary collapse followed by thermonuclear war before summer if Jimmy Carter were elected. LaRouche also described Carter as [...] "a nitwit to begin with, an empty slop jar into which bad lemonade is being poured." [...] However, conservative Republicans like President Ford fared better, incongruously so, given the Labor Party's stated left-wing stance. [...] "I call them honest Americans", LaRouche said. He described Ford as [...] "weak but well-meaning" [...] and [...] "a known quantity <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with".|$|E

[...] They attended The Bolles School, in Jacksonville, Florida, together. [...] There they were roommates for two years, swim team teammates, and became best friends. [...] Qupty's father, commenting on the friendship and teamwork between his Christian Arab Israeli son and his son's Jewish Israeli roommate/teammate, said: [...] "Just to see them together after the race jumping and hugging each other; they were so happy. I was looking at them through my tears. Coming from our part of the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation is. If I can live with a Palestinian guy, I'm sure in our country <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with a couple millions of Palestinians and Israelis together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discontent with Diệm and Nhu {{exploded}} into mass protest during mid-1963 when nine Buddhists {{died at the}} hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. In response, the US government {{was concerned about the}} possibility [...] "for the Dim/Nhu government to succeed and for us [...] to continue to support them." [...] The response by Ambassador Nolting was, [...] "We should take it slow and easy and see if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>live</b> with the Diem government." [...] As a result of this potential inability to support the Diem/Nhu government, the United States government discussed a proposed coup. In a telegram to the American Embassy in Saigon, Mr. Hilsman expresses that at some point should we need [...] "political liquidation" [...] we should also [...] "urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary." [...] In May 1963, a law against the flying of religious flags was selectively enforced; the Buddhist flag was banned from display on Vesak while the Vatican flag was displayed to celebrate the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, Diệm's brother. Many Buddhists defied the ban and a protest was ended when government forces opened fire. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of escalating Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power.|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>live,</b> for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
