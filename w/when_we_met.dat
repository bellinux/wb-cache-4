5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met.</b> It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> with him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E
500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback and Juliet Richardson. Parts of the chorus were initially conceptualized by Karlsson and Winnberg, also known as Bloodshy & Avant, prior to forming the band in 2007. Karlsson told music website musicOMH, [...] "It's the only song on the album that we had an idea before and we kind of saved , like we want this song for our own project. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> Andrew [...] {{and we decided to}} start the band, it was only an idea, but we played it for Andrew and he really liked it." [...] It was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.

500|$|Erik Nordby of KNB (known for {{his work}} on The Haunting in Connecticut, which also {{features}} co-star Kyle Gallner) stated, [...] "We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together." [...] He said the director and producers wanted an [...] "old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects" [...] so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline. Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and [...] "provided a clear direction" [...] for Nordby and his team. [...] "At that point <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'" [...] he said. [...] "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." [...] Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB [...] "produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [...] and [...] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety" [...] and that [...] " [...] responded really well".|$|E
2500|$|In his {{paintings}} of Filipino women, the Philippine National Artist Fernando Amorsolo rejected Western ideals of beauty {{in favor of}} Filipino ideals. [...] He said that the women he painted have [...] "a rounded face, not of the oval type often presented to us in newspapers and magazine illustrations. The eyes should be exceptionally lively, not the dreamy, sleepy type that characterizes the Mongolian. The nose should be of the blunt form but firm and strongly marked. ... So the ideal Filipino beauty should not necessarily be white complexioned, nor of the dark brown color of the typical Malayan, but of the clear skin or fresh colored type which we often witness <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> a blushing girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|By then, he {{had turned}} his back on the {{portrait}} genre, including on his trademark canvasses of peasants and shepherds, and his art became semi-abstract. He was seen in modernist circles, and contributed to the 1934 exhibit Peisajul bucure»ôtean ("The Landscape of Bucharest"), with paintings dating back to 1919. A year later, he had a retrospective show at Dalles, which ran parallel to the debut exhibit of Alexandru Ciucurencu. Zambaccian recalls that Sion felt jealousy toward Ciucurencu's fast rise. According to Zambaccian's own account: [...] "And since I was more preoccupied with Ciucurencu than Theodorescu Sion, he got upset and put up a sign on the door of his exhibit: 'No Entry for Dogs and Zambaccian'. Of course the storm soon subsided. The painter's wife tore off the card, and Theodorescu Sion kissed me <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> again!" ...|$|E

But then, when we had to do the interviews about it, we said [...] "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do." [...] Even the girl, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>met</b> her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.|$|E
