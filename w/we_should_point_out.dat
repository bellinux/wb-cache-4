40|$|Star {{networks}} were proposed recently as an attractive {{alternative to the}} well-known hypercube models for interconnection networks. Extensive research has been performed that shows that star networks are as versatile as hypercubes. This paper is an effort in the same direction. Based on the well-known paradigms, we study the one-to-many parallel routing problem on star networks and develop an improved routing algorithm that finds n, 1 node-disjoint paths between one node {{and a set of}} other n, 1 nodes in the n-star network. These parallel paths are proven of minimum length within a small additive constant, and our algorithm has an optimal time complexity. This result significantly improves the previous known algorithms for the problem. Moreover, the algorithm well illustrates an application of the orthogonal partition of star networks, which was observed by the original inventors of the star networks but seems generally overlooked in the subsequent study. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that similar problems are already studied for hypercubes and have proven useful in designing efficient and fault tolerant routing algorithms on hypercube networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this poster, {{we present}} a novel {{statistical}} rule discovery for understanding behaviours of swarm robots. Swarm robots [Parker 08] are autonomous agents each of whom interacts with their environment locally based on a relatively simple program but as a system they exhibit complex collective behaviours. It {{has been shown that}} learning a model of the control program of a robot helps the designer to better understand the program, especially when the program is highly complex [Fox 06]. One of the essentials of statistical rule discovery is its ability to focus on the interesting aspects of the given data, which seems to fit the nature of the control programs of swarm robots. <b>We</b> <b>should,</b> however, <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that traditional statistical rule discovery which extracts a set of rules from data has several limitations for this new application. Firstly, it allows different discovered rules to cover an identical example, which makes it difficult for the designer to understand the controller. Secondly, it assumes that the discovered rules serve as hints to the user, which leaves the designer most of the work of understanding the program. Thirdly, it is typically evaluated based on a single trial, which prohibits us to discuss its robustness against misunderstanding and noise quantitatively.

30|$|The {{recovery}} of state filling signal as seen for the shorter probing wavelengths (340 nm, 370 nm) in Fig. 2 {{consists of two}} distinct temporal components, a fast and a much slower component. The fast component as we will show later on {{in this study is}} mainly due to Auger recombination, whereas the slower component which is of the order of 100 ps is associated with recombination or capture of the photo-generated carriers by various traps or surface-related states. It appears with increasing probing wavelength, the coupling from the valence bands to the available energy states below the band gap becomes weaker thus the state filling is reduced (this is in agreement with the broad photoluminescence spectra which drops to zero at ~ 460 nm). At the same time the contribution of secondary excitations increases, possibly, due to available higher energy states in the bands that the photo-generated carriers may couple by conserving energy and momentum. This is clearly evident from the observed increase in positive-induced absorption with increasing probing wavelength (Fig. 2). <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that at some point both effects may be present as seen in Fig. 2 at the probing wavelength of 410 nm.

30|$|The methods we {{introduced}} can {{be generalized to}} higher dimensional systems including networks of coupled oscillators or neurons [16, 17, 19, 21 – 24]. The reader interested in this approach is encouraged to explore the extensive literature on path integrals and field theory. Bressloff [13] covers {{the connection between the}} path integral approach and large deviation theory. The reader should be aware that most of the references listed will concentrate on applications and formulations appropriate for equilibrium statistical mechanics and particle physics, which means that they will not explicitly discuss the response function approach we have demonstrated here. For application driven examinations of path integration there is Kleinert [11], Schulman [34], Kardar [27] and Tauber [12]. More mathematically rigorous treatments can be found in Simon [35] and Glimm and Jaffe [36]. For the reader seeking more familiarity with concepts of stochastic calculus such as Ito or Stratonovich integration there are applied approaches [3] and rigorous treatments [37] as well. Zinn-Justin [26] covers a wide array of topics of interest in quantum field theory from statistical mechanics to particle physics. Despite the exceptionally terse and dense presentation, the elementary material in this volume is recommended to those new to the concept of path integrals. Note that Zinn-Justin covers SDEs in a somewhat different manner from that presented here (the Onsager–Machlup integral is derived; although see Chaps. 16 and 17), as does Kleinert. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the parallel between the form of the action for exponential decay (i.e. D = 0 in the OU process) and the holomorphic representation of the harmonic oscillator presented in [26]. The response function formalism was introduced by Martin et al. [29]. Closely related path integral formalisms have been introduced via the work of Doi [5, 6] and Peliti [7] which have been used in the analysis of reaction–diffusion system [8 – 10, 30]. Uses of path integrals in neuroscience have appeared in [14, 15, 17 – 21, 23, 25].|$|R

40|$|The present {{communication}} aims {{to introduce}} an intercession {{tool in the}} design or re-design process of a brand for the creation-conception-assessment of impacts of the brand, which will support the designer in his decision making. In his performance, the designer is usually confronted with a double complexity, the narcissistic perspective of the client ordering the job, not infrequently trying to impose it, and the designer’s own perspective, often twisted due to his {{lack of knowledge of}} much of the environment where the brand finds itself inserted in and/or because he is eager to experiment new visual forms. The lack of tools, conceptually accurate and simultaneously easy to use, to carry out the implementation, collection of data, analysis and assessment, together with the pressure felt by the time needed to devote oneself to complementary studies to support the whole process, raises a few questions emerging from the process free option. So being, within the methodology approach of study the case, two methods are used which, within their differences and complementarities, are taken as fundamental to build up this new tool. The purpose of this tool is to revolutionize. On one hand, to control the above mentioned complexity, but above all to contribute and strengthen the visual component of the brand sustained in argumentative grounds that will become evident upon using the tool.

In fact the Sierra Maestra, the site of the first revolutionary settlement, is a place where peasants who had struggled against large landholders took refuge. They went there seeking new land — somehow overlooked by the state or the voracious landholders — on which to earn a modest income. They struggled constantly against the demands of the soldiers, always allied to the landholders, and their ambitions extended no further than a property deed. The peasants who belonged to our first guerrilla armies came from that section of this social class which most strongly shows love for the land and the possession of it; that is to say, which most perfectly demonstrates the petty-bourgeois spirit. The peasants fought because they wanted land for themselves and their children, to manage and sell it and to enrich themselves through their labor. Despite their petty-bourgeois spirit, the peasants soon learned that they could not satisfy their desire to possess land without breaking up the large landholding system. Radical agrarian reform, the only type that could give land to the peasants, clashed directly with the interests of the imperialists, the large landholders and the sugar and cattle magnates. The bourgeoisie was afraid to clash with those interests but the proletariat was not. In this way the course of the revolution itself brought the workers and peasants together. The workers supported the demands of the peasants against the large landholders.
