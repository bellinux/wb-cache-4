5|$|There is {{some debate}} over whether the Electoral College favors small- or large-population states. Those who argue that the College favors low-population states point out that such states have {{proportionally}} more electoral votes relative to their populations, because each state's number of electors is greater by two than its (proportionally allocated) number of Congressional representatives. In the most populous state, California, this results in an electoral clout 16% smaller than a purely proportional allocation would produce, whereas the least-populous states, with three electors, hold a voting power 143% greater than they would under purely proportional allocation. The proposed compact would give equal weight to each voter's ballot, regardless of <b>what</b> <b>state</b> they live in. Others, however, believe that since most states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all system, the potential of populous states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.|$|E

Metcalfe told an Inside Soap reporter that this left Mercedes [...] "devastated" [...] as she has [...] "built up the courage to go through with it". Metcalfe went onto tease that things will get [...] "darker" [...] for her character. Mercedes became depressed and her sister Jacqui decided to help her. Mercedes attempted to seduce Jacqui's husband Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who told Jacqui. Cooper said Jacqui [...] "knows <b>what</b> <b>state</b> of mind" [...] Mercedes was in and [...] "lays into" [...] Mercedes, who revealed she has been working as a prostitute. Cooper explained Jacqui's reaction is [...] "pretty harsh" [...] and that she thought Mercedes was a [...] "promiscuous tart and a pathetic excuse for a woman" [...] with [...] "no morals". Cooper said Jacqui had [...] "given Mercedes chance after chance, and feels that she doesn't deserve anything more".|$|E
500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, and from <b>what</b> <b>state</b> of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{examining}} state {{practice to}} determine relevant rules of international law, {{it is necessary}} to take into account every activity of the organs and officials of states that relate to that purpose. There has been continuing debate over where a distinction should be drawn as to the weight that should be attributed to <b>what</b> <b>states</b> do, rather than what they say represents the law. In its most extreme form, this would involve rejecting <b>what</b> <b>states</b> say as practice and relegating it to the status of evidence of opinion juries. A more moderate version would evaluate <b>what</b> a <b>state</b> says by reference to the occasion on which the statement was made. It is only relatively powerful countries with extensive international contacts and interests that have regular opportunities of contributing by deed to the practice of international law. The principal means of contribution to state practice for the majority of states will be at meetings of international organizations, particularly the UN General Assembly, by voting and otherwise express their view on matters under consideration. Moreover, there are circumstances in which <b>what</b> <b>states</b> say may be the only evidence of their view as to what conduct is required in a particular situation.|$|R
50|$|The constructivist {{sentiment}} is {{summed up in}} the following extract from Wendt’s seminal constructivist text, Anarchy is <b>what</b> <b>states</b> make of it:"I argue that self-help and power politics do not follow either logically or casually from anarchy and that if today {{we find ourselves in}} a self-help world, this is due to process, not structure. There is no “logic” of anarchy apart from the practices that create and instantiate one structure of identities and interests rather than another; structure has no existence or casual powers apart from process. Self-help and power politics are institutions, not essential features, of anarchy. Anarchy is <b>what</b> <b>states</b> make of it".|$|R

The new government was like the old, to be made up of pre-existing states. Now there was to be admission of new states. Regular order would provide new states by state legislatures for Kentucky, Tennessee and Maine. But the Articles Congress had by its Northwest Ordnance presented the Convention with a new issue. Settlers in the Northwest Territory might one day constitute themselves into [...] "no more than five" [...] states. More difficult still, most delegates anticipated adding alien peoples of Canada, Louisiana and Florida to United States territory. Generally in American history, European citizens of empire were given U.S. citizenship on territorial acquisition. Should they become states? ...|$|E

40|$|This essay classifies Waltz’s theory into a functionalist framework, {{very much}} like the {{economic}} theories it is inspired by. Waltz assumes that structure has primacy not because this is the case, but because it helps to theorize upon. His theory should therefore be measured by its predictive fruitfulness and simplicity, not by the empiric truth of its assumptions. Constructivist criticism, which mistakes Waltz’s concept of primacy as ontological primacy and not epistemological, therefore makes a categorical mistake. Anarchy might be <b>what</b> <b>states</b> make of it, but <b>what</b> <b>states</b> make of it is broadly shown by his Theory of International Politics (TIP). By viewing TIP as a functionalist macro-theory it can incorporate constructivist theories as control-theories and creates a powerful synthesis for future research...|$|R
2500|$|Restoration ecology is {{the name}} given to an attempt to reverse or {{mitigate}} {{some of the changes}} that humans have caused to an ecosystem. Controlled burning is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to <b>what</b> <b>state</b> managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether [...] "natural" [...] means pre-human or pre-European. Native American use of fire, not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the savannas of North America. When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate.|$|E
