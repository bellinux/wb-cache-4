5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} and billing {{this was only}} McKay's fifth prize-fight. Since his defeat {{at the hands of}} Byrne two-and-half years earlier McKay had fought and won just three matches, earning him £180, while Byrne had earned £200. Both men were promised £200 for the match whatever its outcome. McKay had earned £100 for his previous fight against Paul Spencer, the most he had ever received; the promised payment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> improvement in his fortunes.|$|E

5|$|The painting's dreamlike and {{haunting}} erotic {{evocation of}} infatuation and obsession <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> popular success. After its first exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons reäcted with horrified fascination {{and the work}} became widely popular, {{to the extent that}} it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} two prisons on Portland: HMP The Verne, which until 1949 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> Victorian {{military}} fortress, and a Young Offenders' Institution (HMYOI) on the Grove clifftop. This {{was the original}} prison (HM Prison Portland) built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a few years until 2005 Britain's only prison ship, HMP The Weare, was berthed in the harbour.|$|E

5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, thanks {{in no small}} part to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|Although Emily Huskisson {{had wanted}} to keep the service {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson had been an instrumental figure in the development of Liverpool and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, 57 {{percent of}} Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish {{as their primary}} {{language}} while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under {{one percent of the}} population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing {{release of the}} year. Fonda had long {{wanted to work with}} her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.|$|E

Tech demolished Nebraska 45–21 in the 1991 Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 11–0–1, and earning a share of the 1990 National Title with the Colorado Buffaloes.|$|E

The 60th anniversary of Malliswari was celebrated with an event at the Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha, Chikkadpally, on 20December 2011.|$|E

5|$|The first {{performance}} of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893, nearly {{six years after}} Verdi's previous premiere. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni; numbers were encored, {{and at the end}} the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan.|$|E

That day, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|Various factors {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US {{at the height of}} a series of {{financial}} recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money to the production of gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge,</b> unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.|$|E
