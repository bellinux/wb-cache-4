2500|$|Ionograms {{show the}} virtual heights and {{critical}} frequencies of the ionospheric layers and <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> an ionosonde. An ionosonde sweeps {{a range of}} frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30nbsp&MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms. Reduction rules are given in: [...] "URSI Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction", edited by William Roy Piggott and Karl Rawer, Elsevier Amsterdam, 1961 (translations into Chinese, French, Japanese and Russian are available).|$|E

50|$|Secured a precedent-setting {{victory on}} behalf of nearly 5,000 abused and {{neglected}} children in a nearly three decade-long case involving the long-troubled Baltimore, Maryland foster care system. The defendants in the case, both Maryland state agencies, had argued that, {{as a result of}} a 2009 Supreme Court decision, foster care children had no rights to enforce federal child welfare laws. In the first ruling by an appellate court on this issue, Circuit Judge Allyson K. Duncan disagreed and found that the state agencies were misinterpreting the Supreme Court decision. Judge Duncan's decision ensures that federal child welfare laws will be enforced in the state of Maryland, meaning that a Baltimore federal court will be allowed to enter a decree negotiated between Venable's attorneys and two Maryland state agencies to compel needed reforms to the foster care system. As a result of the decision, Maryland must comply with 28 separate outcomes for the foster children, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> over 100 performance measures.|$|E
5000|$|Language {{also plays}} an {{important}} part in the evaluation process, as language is tied closely to culture. [...] Language can be a major barrier to communicating concepts which the evaluator is trying to access, and translation is often required. [...] There are a multitude of problems with translation, including the loss of meaning as well as the exaggeration or enhancement of meaning by translators. [...] For example, terms which are contextually specific may not translate into another language with the same weight or meaning. In particular, data collection instruments need to take meaning into account as the subject matter may not be considered sensitive in a particular context might prove to be sensitive in {{the context in which the}} evaluation is taking place. [...] Thus, evaluators need to take into account two important concepts when administering data collection tools: lexical equivalence and conceptual equivalence. [...] Lexical equivalence asks the question: how does one phrase a question in two languages using the same words? This is a difficult task to accomplish, and uses of techniques such as back-translation may aid the evaluator but may not result in perfect transference of meaning. [...] This leads to the next point, conceptual equivalence. It is not a common occurrence for concepts to transfer unambiguously from one culture to another. [...] Data collection instruments which have not undergone adequate testing and piloting may therefore render results which are not useful as the concepts <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the instrument may have taken on a different meaning and thus rendered the instrument unreliable and invalid.|$|E
