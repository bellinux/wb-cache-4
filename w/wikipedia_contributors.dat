The project sought funding through Indiegogo, and was intended to honor the contributions of Wikipedia's editors. On 22 October 2014, the first monument to Wikipedia was unveiled in the Polish town of Slubice.|$|E
500|$|The IWF {{said they}} were first {{notified}} of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given that you can go into HMV and buy a copy on the high street". [...] On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages {{on the basis of the}} [...] "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".|$|E

5000|$|The Wikimedia Foundation was {{announced}} on June 20, 2003, and in July, <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> Daniel Mayer suggested the name [...] "MediaWiki" [...] for the software, as {{a play on}} [...] "Wikimedia". The name was gradually phased in beginning in August 2003. The name has frequently caused confusion due to its (intentional) similarity to the [...] "Wikimedia" [...] name (which itself is similar to [...] "Wikipedia"). PR Watch editor and <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> Sheldon Rampton coined the name [...] "Wikimedia" [...] in a March 16, 2003 message posted to the WikiEN-l mailing list.|$|R
5000|$|The DCRI then {{pressured}} Rémi Mathis, {{a volunteer}} {{administrator of the}} French-language Wikipedia, and president of Wikimedia France, into deleting the article. Later, the article was restored by another <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> living in Switzerland.|$|R
25|$|Wikipedia's initial anarchy {{integrated}} {{democratic and}} hierarchical elements over time. An article {{is not considered}} to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority. <b>Wikipedia's</b> <b>contributors</b> avoid a tragedy of the commons by internalizing benefits. They do this by experiencing flow and identifying with and gaining status in the Wikipedia community.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{studies have}} been done with regard to the motivations of <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors.</b> In a 2003 study of Wikipedia as a community, {{economics}} Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in wiki software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a [...] "creative construction" [...] approach encourages participation. A paper written by Andrea Forte and Amy Bruckman in 2005, called [...] "Why Do People Write for Wikipedia? Incentives to Contribute to Open-Content Publishing", discussed the possible motivations of <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors.</b> It applied Latour and Woolgar's concept of the cycle of credit to <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors,</b> suggesting that the reason that people write for Wikipedia is to gain recognition within the community.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{the article}} was {{restored}} by other <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors.</b> The French Ministry of the Interior told Agence France-Presse that for the moment it {{did not wish to}} comment on the incident.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 100,000 articles milestone, the Science and Technology Committee of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) invited <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> and users to the 2 February 2010 morning meeting, to join in a debate about Wikipedia and other open-source resources. Some <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> at the meeting criticized [...] "the lack of government cooperation with their efforts to compile a free online Hebrew-language encyclopedia," [...] as well as sharing complaints from Wikipedia editors abroad that since the Israel Defense Forces does not release photos for free redistribution on the Internet, the sole source of available pictures for entries such as the Gaza War and the 2006 Lebanon War are the Palestinians.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 {{article in}} The Brooklyn Rail, <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> David Shankbone contended {{that he had}} been harassed and stalked because of his work on Wikipedia, had {{received}} no support from the authorities or the Wikimedia Foundation, and only mixed support from the Wikipedia community.

5000|$|The 'Monkey-selfie selfie' {{became a}} theme at Wikimania 2014 at the Barbican Centre in London. Conference attendees, {{including}} Wikipedia co-founder and Wikimedia Foundation board member Jimmy Wales, posed for selfies with printed {{copies of the}} macaque photograph. Reaction to these selfies and to pre-printed monkey posters was mixed. According to <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> Andreas Kolbe, writing in Wikipediocracy, Wales' action was criticized by some users on Twitter and Wikipedia [...] "for what appeared like tactless gloating".|$|R
50|$|The Wikipedia Monument (Pomnik Wikipedii), {{located in}} Słubice, Poland, is a statue {{designed}} by Armenian sculptor Mihran Hakobyan honoring <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors.</b> It was unveiled in Frankfurt Square (Plac Frankfurcki) on 22 October 2014 {{in a ceremony}} that included representatives from both local Wikimedia chapters and the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E

50|$|Chinese <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> {{come from}} a variety of backgrounds. Just as English Wikipedia tends to be more {{detailed}} in western-related topics, the Chinese Wikipedia has very detailed descriptions of China-related topics. Within that region, the Chinese Wikipedia tends to be more detailed in topics about Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the wealthy east coast provinces of mainland China.|$|E
50|$|In June 2007, an {{anonymous}} <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> {{became involved in}} the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide because of an unverified piece of information he added to the Chris Benoit English Wikipedia article. This information regarding Benoit's wife's death was added fourteen hours before police discovered the bodies of Benoit and his family. Police detectives seized computer equipment from the man held responsible for the postings, but believed he was uninvolved and did not press charges.|$|R
5000|$|The Wikipedia {{community}} is {{the community of}} contributors to the online encyclopedia <b>Wikipedia.</b> Individual <b>contributors</b> are known as [...] "Wikipedians". OxfordDictionaries.com added the word [...] "Wikipedian" [...] in August 2012.|$|R
50|$|In mid-2012, a {{proposal}} was floated {{by members of}} the editing community to fork their work at Wikitravel (forking in this context means to move editing activities and current content to a new host, in accordance with the site license) and re-merge with the travel website Wikivoyage—which had been a fork of German and Italian language Wikitravel some years before—and to then seek hosting of the merged sites by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Internet Brands opposed this move and sued one Wikitravel <b>contributor</b> and one <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor,</b> alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition and civil conspiracy. This move was opposed by individuals and by the Wikimedia Foundation as being an example of a SLAPP lawsuit—one undertaken without plausible legal grounds with a primary intent being to deter, overwhelm, or frustrate persons engaged in fully lawful actions.|$|R
50|$|Seedfeeder's {{drawings}} {{were also}} met with controversy. Some <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> perceived there to be racist and sexist undertones, resulting in the removal of some images from English-language Wikimedia projects. A depiction of a facial featuring a black man ejaculating onto a white woman prompted criticism, with some users claiming that the image was racist and promoted violence against women.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{published}} in 2014 found that {{there is also an}} [...] "Internet skills gap" [...] with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the [...] "skills gap" [...] exacerbates the gender gap among editors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{active area}} of {{research}} studies the incentives to produce user-generated content such as Wikipedia articles, digital videos, blogs, podcasts, etc. For example, Zhang and Zhu (2011) show that <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> are motivated by the social interaction with other contributors. Greenstein and Zhu (2012) show that while many Wikipedia articles exhibit slant, the overall level of slant across articles on Wikipedia has diminished over time.|$|E
5000|$|A 2014 {{study that}} {{examined}} 97 Wikipedia articles about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) found that 4% {{of them had}} attained [...] "Good article" [...] status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies. In May 2014, The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association published an article which concluded that [...] "Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources." [...] Following this paper, many other media sources reported that readers should not trust Wikipedia for medical information. <b>Wikipedia's</b> <b>contributors</b> to its health content defended Wikipedia and criticized this study, as the research is considered severely flawed including basic methodological flaws like the conclusions are {{not supported by the}} data provided.|$|R
5000|$|The website {{was founded}} by Colten Caudle on February 17, 2016. It {{received}} 1,000 registered users and one million hits within the first hour. Initial attention crashed the website and an upgrade was required. An online fundraiser via GoFundMe was posted to help with server costs. At the same time, a potential competitor, Bernie People Meet, was launched {{in an effort to}} seize the opportunity. After quick negotiations, the two merged resources and fundraising efforts began. The target goal was $1,000 with the stipulation that excess funds would be donated to the Sanders campaign. With the help of a team of volunteers, led by developer [...] Jeremiah Pegues and former <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> Daniel Isaksen, the site was relaunched four days later. After its launch, Bernie Singles became a trending topic on Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to several}} book {{digitizing}} initiatives {{such as the}} Gutenberg project, and The Hawkins Electrical Guide Online, many of these older public domain books are becoming available on the Internet. This series of books is currently available for free, non-commercial use from Google Books and each volume can be downloaded as a PDF, though the illustration scan quality {{is not as good}} as the ones being added to Wikipedia on this page by <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Studies of {{the size}} of the {{community}} of Wikipedia showed an exponential growth in the number of <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> during the early years. In April 2008, writer and lecturer Clay Shirky and computer scientist Martin Wattenberg estimated the total time spent creating Wikipedia at roughly 100 million hours. In November 2011, there were approximately 31.7 million registered user accounts across all language editions, of which around 270,000 were [...] "active" [...] (made at least one edit every month).|$|E
50|$|The Wikimedia Foundation {{has carried}} out several surveys of <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributors</b> and users. In 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation, {{alongside}} the Collaborative Creativity Group at UNU-Merit, launched {{a survey of}} readers and editors of Wikipedia. It was the most comprehensive survey of Wikipedia ever conducted. The results of the survey were published two years later on March 24, 2010. The Wikimedia Foundation began a process in 2011 of semi-annual surveys {{in order to understand}} Wikipedia editors more and better cater to their needs.|$|E
2500|$|One {{study found}} that the <b>{{contributor}}</b> base to <b>Wikipedia</b> [...] "was barely 13% women; the average age of a contributor was in the mid-20s". A 2011 study by researchers from the University of Minnesota found that females comprised 16.1% of the 38,497 editors who started editing Wikipedia during 2009. In a January 2011 New York Times article, Noam Cohen observed that just 13% of <b>Wikipedia's</b> <b>contributors</b> are female according to a 2008 Wikimedia Foundation survey. Sue Gardner, a {{former executive director of the}} Wikimedia Foundation, hoped to see female contributions increase to 25% by 2015. Linda Basch, president of the National Council for Research on Women, noted the contrast in these Wikipedia editor statistics with the percentage of women currently completing bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD programs in the United States (all at rates of 50 percent or greater).|$|R
5000|$|Seife {{observed}} that when bogus information from Wikipedia spreads to other publications, it sometimes alters truth itself. On 28 June 2012, for example, an anonymous <b>Wikipedia</b> <b>contributor</b> added the invented nickname [...] "Millville Meteor" [...] to the Wikipedia biography of baseball player Mike Trout. A {{couple of weeks}} later, a Newsday sports writer reproduced the nickname in an article, and [...] "with that act, the fake nickname became real". Seife pointed out that while Wikipedia, by some standards, {{could be described as}} [...] "roughly as accurate" [...] as traditional publications, and is more up to date, [...] "there's a difference between the kind of error one would find in Wikipedia and what one would in Britannica or Collier's or even in the now-defunct Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia ... the majority of hoaxes on Wikipedia could never have appeared in the old-fashioned encyclopedias." [...] Dwight Garner, reviewing Seife's book in The New York Times, said that he himself had [...] "been burned enough times by bad online information", including [...] "Wikipedia howlers", to have a adopted a very sceptical mindset.|$|R
40|$|Store norske leksikon (SNL) [Great Norwegian Encyclopaedia] is an edited, online {{encyclopaedia}} that strives towards radical transparency.
