40|$|Robots {{are used}} exhaustively for contact {{tasks such as}} grinding, scribing, and {{deburring}} in the manufacturing industry. In these tasks, the robot has position constraints in some directions and force constraints in other directions. It is most often {{the case that the}} robot is commanded to maintain a contact force in the normal direction of the workpiece surface while following a trajectory in the tangent plane. For the robot to successfully maintain contact while performing the task, it is essential to know the precise position and geometry of the workpiece, but in practice, there are uncertainties in both. Inaccuracies in <b>workpiece</b> <b>mounting</b> combined with manufacturing tolerances and workpiece wear significantly deviate the positioning and part information from the ideal image of where the workpiece should be and how it should look. The following dissertation develops a novel process that allows the robot to complete successful contact tasks during the presence of workpiece uncertainties and workpiece movements. Furthermore, a strategy is devised that uses existing sensors on industrial robots to gather information to update workpiece geometry and placement in real time, thereby reducing the workpiece uncertainties and improving the overall performance of the robot. A number of simulation experiments demonstrate that these methodologies can be successfully applied to a typical industrial robot with 6 degrees-of-freedom. ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main genres of {{engraving}} machines: The most common is the X-Y table where, usually, the workpiece (surface) is stationary and the laser optics move around in X and Y directions, directing the laser beam to draw vectors. Sometimes the laser is stationary and the workpiece moves. Sometimes the workpiece {{moves in the}} Y axis and the laser in the X axis. A second genre is for cylindrical workpieces (or flat <b>workpieces</b> <b>mounted</b> around a cylinder) where the laser effectively traverses a fine helix and on/off laser pulsing produces the desired image on a raster basis. In the third method, both the laser and workpiece are stationary and galvo mirrors move the laser beam over the workpiece surface. Laser engravers using this technology can work in either raster or vector mode.|$|R
40|$|AbstractArising {{vibrations}} when milling thin-walled {{parts are}} the most essential factor that limits machining productivity and surface location accuracy. Such vibrations have large amplitude and often result in irreversible workpiece damage on finishing stage. Vibrations appear {{as a result of}} resonance of workpiece natural frequencies and cutting force spectrum harmonics from tooth- passing impacts. To eliminate resonance vibrations it is suggested to tune spindle speed in such a way, that workpiece natural frequencies differs from tooth-passing frequency harmonics. In practice changing of natural frequencies due to stock removal and changing of cutter position during machining process need to be considered. To estimate natural frequencies and mode shapes of <b>workpiece</b> <b>mounted</b> on NC machine worktable and its evolution during the process it is reasonable to apply widespread finite element modeling software.

40|$|Process {{planning}} {{is a major}} determinant of manufacturing cost. The selection of machining parameters is an important element of process planning. The development of a utility to show the cutting power on-line would be helpful to programmers and process planners in selecting machining parameters. The relationship between the cutting power and the machining parameters is nonlinear. Presently there is no accurate or simple algorithm to calculate the required cutting power for a selected set of parameters. Although machining data handbooks, machinability data systems, and machining databases have been developed to recommend machining parameters for efficient machining, they are basically for general reference and hard to use as well;In this research, a self-organizing fuzzy-nets optimization system was developed to generate a knowledge bank that can show the required cutting power on-line for a short length of time in an NC verifier. The fuzzy-nets system (FNS) utilizes a five-step self-learning procedure. A generic FNS program consisting of fuzzification and defuzzification modules was implemented in the C++ programming language to perform the procedure. The FNS was assessed before an actual experiment was set up to collect data;The performance of the FNS was then examined for end milling operations on a Fadal VMC 40 vertical machining center. The cutting force signals were measured by a three-component dynamometer mounted on the table of the Fadal CNC machine with the <b>workpiece</b> <b>mounted</b> on it. Amplified signals were collected by a personal computer on which an Omega DAS- 1401 analog-to-digital (A/D) converter was installed to sample the data on-line.

The values of cutting power predicted by the FNS were more accurate than the formula values. Compared to the FNS system, dynamometers and amplifiers are very expensive. Thus, most of them could be replaced with the FNS...|$|R

To finish the molds with high accuracy and low surface roughness, in this paper, the micro-aspheric mold made of electroless nickel plating are polished by using the newly developed 5 -axis magnetostrictive vibration-assisted polishing machine.

50|$|CNC {{machines}} {{can exist}} in virtually {{any of the}} forms of manual machinery, like horizontal mills. The most advanced CNC milling-machines, the multiaxis machine, add two more axes {{in addition to the}} three normal axes (XYZ). Horizontal milling machines also have a C or Q axis, allowing the horizontally <b>mounted</b> <b>workpiece</b> to be rotated, essentially allowing asymmetric and eccentric turning. The fifth axis (B axis) controls the tilt of the tool itself. When all of these axes are used in conjunction with each other, extremely complicated geometries, even organic geometries such as a human head can be made with relative ease with these machines. But the skill to program such geometries is beyond that of most operators. Therefore, 5-axis milling machines are practically always programmed with CAM.|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of precision laser targets requires {{a wide variety}} of specialized mesoscale manufacturing techniques. The diamond wire saw developed in this study provides the capability to precisely section meso-scale <b>workpieces</b> <b>mounted</b> on the assembly stations used by the Target Fabrication Group. This new capability greatly simplifies the {{fabrication of}} many types of targets and reduces the time and cost required to build the targets. A variety of materials are used to fabricate targets, including metals, plastics with custom designed chemical formulas, and aerogels of various densities. The materials are usually provided in the form of small pieces or cast rods that must be machined to the required shape. Many of these materials, such as metals and some plastics, can be trimmed using a parting tool on a diamond turning machine. However, other materials, such as aerogels and brittle materials, cannot be adequately cut with a parting tool. In addition, the geometry of the parts often requires that the workpieces be held in a special assembly station, which excludes the use of a parting tool. In the past, these materials were sectioned using a small, handheld coping saw that used a diamond-impregnated wire as a blade. This miniature coping saw was effective, but it required several hours to cut through certain materials. Furthermore, the saw was guided by hand and often caused significant damage to fragile aerogels. To solve these problems, the diamond wire saw shown in Figure 1 was developed. The diamond wire saw is designed to machine through materials that are mounted in the Target Fabrication Group's benchtop assembly stations. These assembly stations are the primary means of aligning and assembling target components, and there is often a need to machine materials while they are mounted in the assembly stations. Unfortunately, commercially available saws are designed for very different applications and are far too large to be used with the assembly stations. Therefore, a custom diamond wire saw was designed and constructed. The diamond wire saw cuts through workpieces using a continuous loop of diamond-impregnated wire of length 840 mm. The wire loop runs around several idler pulleys and is driven by a simple geared DC motor that rotates at 17 rpm. The linear speed of the wire is 107 inches/minute. The saw is oriented at an angle of 20 {sup o} from horizontal, so the operator can view the wire through the cutout at {{the front end of the}} saw. When looking through a microscope or camera with a horizontal line of sight, the operator can clearly see the wire as it cuts through the workpiece, as shown in the right side of Figure 1. The saw is mounted on a two-axis stage that allows the operator to align the wire with the workpiece. To cut through the workpiece, the operator drives the wire through the workpiece by turning the feed micrometer. An image of the interior of the diamond wire saw appears in Figure 2. This picture was taken after removing the protective cover plate from the saw...|$|R
40|$|Modern 5 -axis {{machining}} centers {{enable the}} {{development and use of}} new machining kinematics and grinding strategies to grind <b>workpieces</b> with superabrasives <b>mounted</b> points. One of these technologies is the oscillating surface grinding (OSG), which can improve the surface characteristics and the tribological properties of machined surfaces. In the current contribution could be observed that the resultant surface roughness values by OSG are not constant within a wavelength of oscillation of the grinding tool. This leads to further studies of the kinematics involved in this process, resulting {{in the development of a}} new grinding strategy: the tilt surface grinding (TSG). By using TSG, workpiece surfaces with similar characteristics as OSG could be obtained even without aid of oscillation. In this study, experimental tests are carried out to investigate the influence of parameters involved in these strategies. A significant parameter is the tilt angle t, which can be simplified as an angle between the directions of the feed rate in tangential direction vft and the feed rate in axial direction vfa of the grinding tool. The tilt angle t is responsible for changes occurred on the OSG when compared to conventional surface grinding. Increasing the tilt angle t, a reduction up to 50 % of the roughness values could be achieved. This paper aims to complement and expand the knowledge of the OSG, explaining how the aid of the oscillation tool changes the grinding kinematic, in order to optimize the grinding process...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{machine tool}} {{structures}} like lathe, milling, broaching, and grinding machines, etc. {{are subjected to}} regular unwanted vibrations. These machine tool vibrations or chatter are deleterious to machining operations. It results in degraded quality on the machined parts, shorter tool life, and unpleasant noise, hence are to be necessarily damped out. The important characteristics of the machine tool structures for metal cutting are high damping and static stiffness which ensure manufacture of work pieces of the required geometries with acceptable surface finish at the required rate of production in the most economical way. The unwanted vibrations must be arrested in ordet to ensure higher accuracy along with productivity. In the present work, the chatter vibrations on a slotted table Horizontal Milling Machine have been damped out using composite structure {{as a substitute for}} the base of the work piece. Glass Fiber Polyester and Glass Fiber Epoxy plates are fixed on to the slotted table as a secondary bed material and the <b>workpiece</b> is <b>mounted</b> on this bed for feeding to the rotating milling cutter. Initially four holes are drilled on each plate of the composite and a set of five plates of each type of composite are mounted for conducting the experiments. A mild steel specimen of similar dimension of the composite plate is placed on the pile of the composites and the setup is fixed to the slotted table using bolts and nuts. An up milling operation is carried out and the vibration signal is recorded on the screen of the digital phosphorus storage oscilloscope. The signal and RMS amplitude, frequency and time period of vibrations are recorded. The experiment is repeated for different sets of composite plates by decreasing the number and the corresponding readings are recorded and tabulated. Moreover, experiments are also conducted without any composite material below the mild steel specimen. It is observed that the vibration amplitude decreases with increase in number of layers of sheets of composites and then increases with increase in number of plates. Moreover, the optimum number of composites are also experimentally determined. The design of the experimental setup has been modeled using CatiaV 5 R 15. Apart from total damping of the system, emphasis has also been focused to find out the material damping of the composite materials so as to select the same for effective damping of the structures. An energy balance approach has been used for calculating the material damping of the fiber reinforced composites used in the experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} geometric algorithms {{to check}} the cleanability of a design during the manufacturing process. The automotive industry needs a computational tool {{to determine how to}} clean their products due to the trend of miniaturization and increased geometric complexity of mechanical parts. A newly emerging concept in a product design, Design-for-Cleanability, necessitates algorithms to help designers to design parts that are easy to clean during the manufacturing process. In this thesis, we consider cleaning using high-pressure water jets to clean off the surfaces of workpieces. Specifically, we solve the following two problems purely from a geometric perspective: predicting water trap regions of a workpiece and finding a rotation axis to drain a workpiece. Finding an orientation that minimizes the potential water trap regions and/or controls their locations when the workpiece is fixtured for water jet cleaning is important to increase the cleaning efficiency. Trapped water leads to stagnation areas, preventing efficient flow cleaning. Minimizing the potential water trap also reduces the draining time and effort after cleaning. We propose a new pool segmentation data structure and algorithm based on topological changes of 2 D slices with respect to the gravity direction. Then, we can quickly predict potential water trap regions of a given geometry by analyzing our directed graph based on the segmented pools. Given a workpiece filled with water after cleaning, to minimize the subsequent drying time, our industrial partner first <b>mounts</b> <b>workpieces</b> on a slowly rotating carrier so that gravity can drain out as much water as possible. We propose an algorithm to find a rotation axis that drains the workpiece when the rotation axis is set parallel to the ground and the workpiece is rotated around the axis. Observing that all water traps contain a concave vertex, we solve our problem by constructing and analyzing a directed "draining graph" whose nodes correspond to concave vertices of the geometry and whose edges are set according to the transition of trapped water when we rotate the workpiece around the given axis. We first introduce an algorithm to test whether a given rotation axis can drain the workpiece. We then extend these concepts to design an algorithm to find the set of all rotation axes that drain the workpiece. If such a rotation axis does not exist, our algorithm will also detect that. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to tackle the draining problem and to give an algorithm for the problem...|$|R
