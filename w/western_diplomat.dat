500|$|Bill Law of the BBC News {{said the}} [...] "recommendations if {{implemented}} in full would effectively return {{the country to}} a state of martial law". An unnamed <b>western</b> <b>diplomat</b> said the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence. Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place. [...] "Thirty-one Bahrainis were stripped of their citizenship back in November 2012, {{and there has been a}} de facto ban on protests in Manama since last year," [...] he added and listed other examples of what he called [...] "reactionary laws" [...] already in place.|$|E
500|$|The state media {{coverage}} of the event resulted in increased support for the Party's persecution efforts against Falun Gong, and eroded public sympathy for the group. Time reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's persecution had gone too far. After the event, however, China's media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction. The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong reported that hostility toward Falun Gong from the general public escalated, the government had stepped up its campaign, and charged that [...] "hate crimes" [...] targeting Falun Gong increased. One <b>western</b> <b>diplomat</b> commented that the public changed from sympathising with Falun Gong to siding with the Government, popular consensus seemingly shifted by human-interest stories and accounts of rehabilitation efforts of former practitioners. Østergaard believes that, in retrospect, the New Year scripture was Li's greatest gift to the state, as the self-immolations marked a turning point which ended domestic support for the movement.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a senior}} <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat,</b> {{hundreds}} of thousands of ballots for Hamid Karzai were from as many as 800 fake polling sites where no one had actually voted. The diplomat and another Western official also said that Karzai supporters took over approximately 800 actual polling centers on election day and used them to fraudulently report tens of thousands of ballots for Karzai. The <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> said: [...] "This was fraud en masse." [...] In Karzai's home province, Kandahar, preliminary results indicated that more than 350,000 ballots had been turned in to be counted, but Western officials estimated that only about 25,000 people had actually voted in the whole province.|$|E

2500|$|In its {{complete}} form, {{the term}} appeared {{for the first}} time in the Romanian language (purificare etnică) in an address by Vice Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu to cabinet members in July 1941. After the beginning of the invasion of the USSR, he concluded: “I do not know when the Romanians will have such chance for ethnic cleansing." [...] In the 1980s, the Soviets used the term [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] to describe the inter-ethnic violence in Nagorno-Karabakh. At around the same time, the Yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an Albanian nationalist plot to force all Serbs to leave Kosovo. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the Bosnian War (1992–95). The first recorded mention of its use in the Western media can be traced back to an article in The New York Times dated 15 April 1992, in a quote by an anonymous <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{tensions}} {{diminished in}} March 1987, with an agreement {{by the two}} nations to withdraw 150,000 troops in the Kashmir area, followed by a second agreement to withdraw more troops in the desert area was also signed the same month. While negotiating the withdrawal accord, India vowed to proceed with Brasstacks, asserting that Pakistan {{had no reason to}} feel provoked. But India did delay the beginning of the last stage of the operation until the following week, while the latest withdrawal agreement was being negotiated. To prove its intentions were peaceful, India took the unusual step of inviting diplomats and journalists to observe the operation separately. The Pakistani foreign service officers, senior diplomats and statesmen were the ones who were invited. According to an unnamed <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat,</b> who maintained that [...] "This was not a third-world army. This was a modern army, fully competent for any mission, easily as good as the Chinese, the Koreans or the French." ...|$|E
50|$|One issue facing Western {{embassies}} to China was {{the act of}} prostration {{known as}} the kowtow. <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> understood that kowtowing meant accepting {{the superiority of the}} Emperor of China over their own monarchs, an act which they found unacceptable.|$|R
5000|$|While <b>Western</b> <b>diplomats</b> {{originally}} warned Pakistan {{the event}} was because [...] "they were not doing enough" [...] to combat terrorism, Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar rebuffed the claims {{pointing out that the}} attack had occurred because Egypt had extradited ten suspected terrorists.|$|R

2500|$|Unofficial {{estimates}} of the death toll have usually been higher than government figures, and {{go as high as}} several thousand. Nicholas D. Kristof, then Beijing bureau chief for The New York Times wrote on June 21 that [...] "it seems plausible that about a dozen soldiers and policemen were killed, along with 400 to 800 civilians." [...] U.S. ambassador James Lilley said that, based on visits to hospitals around Beijing, a minimum of several hundred had been killed. In a 1990 article addressing the question, Time magazine said that the Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths on the morning of June 4, though later this figure was retracted. A declassified NSA cable filed on the same day estimated 180–500 deaths up to the morning of June4. Amnesty International's estimates puts the number of deaths at between several hundred and close to 1,000, while a <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> who compiled estimates put the number at 300 to 1,000.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{briefing}} to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a [...] "nuclear clean-up." [...] These images showed a building at Parchin covered in {{what appeared to}} be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would [...] "significantly hamper" [...] its investigation. [...] A senior <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> described the presentation as [...] "pretty compelling." [...] The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said that the purpose of the pink tarpaulin could be to hide further [...] "clean-up work" [...] from satellites.

2500|$|Speaking {{afterward}} {{about his}} one-day presidency, Carmona told The Miami Herald {{that he had}} been [...] "misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command," [...] whereas if the coup had [...] "been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made." [...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never {{know what is going on}} underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One <b>Western</b> <b>diplomat</b> told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope." [...] Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a [...] "civic activist" [...] but would leave politics: [...] "I have never been a politician; that is not my world," [...] Carmona said. [...] "As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle." ...|$|E
