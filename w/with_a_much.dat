5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E

5|$|Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared {{from the}} body by tubular {{secretion}} and excreted unchanged in the urine; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics).|$|E
5|$|Reading Abbey {{was founded}} by Henry I in 1121. He was buried there, as were parts of his {{daughter}} Empress Matilda, William of Poitiers, Constance of York, and Princess Isabella of Cornwall, among others. The abbey {{was one of the}} pilgrimage centres of medieval England; it held over 230 relics including the hand of St. James. Today all that remains of the abbey are the inner rubble cores of the walls of many of the major buildings of the abbey, together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> restored inner gateway and the intact hospitium.|$|E

5|$|The FB-22 was a {{proposed}} medium-range bomber for the USAF. The FB-22 was projected {{to carry up}} to 30 Small Diameter Bombs to about twice {{the range of the}} F-22A, while maintaining the F-22's stealth and supersonic speed. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments, in lieu of a larger subsonic bomber <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater range.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Warner UK in 2002, Cher {{signed a}} {{worldwide}} {{deal with the}} U.S. division of Warner Bros. Records in September 2003. The Very Best of Cher (2003), a greatest-hits collection that surveys her entire career, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA. She played herself in the Farrelly brothers comedy Stuck on You (2003), mocking her public image as she appears in bed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> younger boyfriend. Her 326-date Farewell Tour ended in 2005 {{as one of the}} highest-grossing concert tours of all time, seen by over 3.5 million fans and earning $250 million. In 2008, she began a three-year, 200-performance residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, for which she earned a reported $60million per year. Titled Cher, the production featured state-of-the-art video and special effects, elaborate set designs, 14 dancers, four aerialists and more than 20 costume changes.|$|E
5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E
5|$|As had {{happened}} during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna–Gona, estimates by Australian intelligence differed greatly from those at GHQ, as they used different methods. The intelligence staff at Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ), headed by Brigadier J. D. Rogers, had come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher figure of 3,000. I Corps produced an estimate of 1,800, which was passed on along with GHQ's estimate. The Allies' best source of intelligence, Ultra, shone no light on the matter. Finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted messages in the previous three months. Most of these were in the insecure Japanese Water Transport Code. Only after the capture of Japanese codebooks in the Battle of Sio in January 1944 were the Allies able to systematically break into the Japanese Army codes. In fact, Japanese strength in the area on 22 September was about 5,000.|$|E

5|$|At {{an unknown}} date, {{which may have}} been in the early 640s, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence and the memory of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of torpedoes meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable. The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin. However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant huntingtin (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E

5|$|Id had {{no clear}} {{expectations}} for Wolfensteins commercial reception, but hoped {{that it would}} make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. PC Zone quoted a shareware distributor as saying Wolfenstein 3D was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of Wolfenstein 3D as well as Spear of Destiny had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly {{by the end of the}} year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols. The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier Commander Keen series and provided id <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart.|$|E
5|$|In a motte-and-bailey design, {{a castle}} {{would include a}} mound called a motte, usually artificially {{constructed}} by piling up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure. A keep and a protective wall would usually be built {{on top of the}} motte. Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.|$|E
5|$|Marty O'Donnell again {{composed}} the original {{score for the}} game. Some pieces of the game's music are produced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger real orchestra than any pieces in the prior two games.

Halo 3 is the first game in the series to feature custom soundtracks, allowing players to replace in-game music with their own choices. The Halo 3 Original Soundtrack was released on November 20, 2007. Included on the soundtrack is an original composition submitted by fans and judged by Nile Rodgers, Michael Ostin, and Marty O'Donnell.|$|E
