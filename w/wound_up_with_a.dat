25|$|The 1994–95 {{season was}} one of {{marginal}} improvement by the Cents, as the team <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of 18–40–2, two wins more than the previous year. Merritt missed the BCJHL playoffs {{for the second straight}} season and also finished in the Interior Division basement {{for the second year in}} a row.|$|E
25|$|But then, San Miguel soon {{won eight}} {{games with the}} arrival of the team's third import, former Alaska Ace Galen Young. SMB <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10-8 win-loss card to end the {{elimination}} round, only to lose to Alaska in the eliminations, and to Air21 in a knockout match for the second outright quarterfinals berth.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–01 season {{featured}} {{a drop of}} two points for the Centennials, but an improvement in the standings to second in the Interior Division. The Cents <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of 30–21–9 and 69 points. However, it wouldn't be the regular season that fans in Merritt would remember the most about the year, rather an improbable run to the Fred Page Cup Final. The Cents faced off against Prince George in the Interior Division opening round and promptly swept the Spruce Kings in four straight. They then met up in the Interior Conference final with the Penticton Panthers, who had finished the season first in the division, 29 points ahead of the Centennials. The first place Panthers proved to be no match for Merritt, as the Cents outscored Penticton 16 to 7 in a four-game sweep. Next up, it was the franchise's first appearance in the Fred Page Cup final, {{and it would be}} against the Victoria Salsa. Despite a thrilling seven game series, the Salsa took the BCHL championship on home ice. Forward Mike Ouelette provided a bright spot individually as he won BCHL Rookie of the Year for the Interior Conference.|$|E
60|$|Standing on the hearth, {{as we have}} said, Willie {{related to}} his friend all he knew {{in regard to the}} Cattley family, and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> anxious demand what was to be done for them.|$|R
6000|$|Here Mrs Rose {{entertained the}} company <b>with</b> <b>a</b> graphic--not to say exaggerated--account of the [...] "small fire" [...] in the study, and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eloquent appeal to all to [...] "beware of fire," [...] and an {{assurance}} {{that there was}} nothing {{on the face of the}} whole earth that she had a greater horror of.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} teams {{announced}} were franchises in Ohsweken, Peterborough, and Montreal. A Brampton Guardian article listed {{a team in}} London. Of the original three, only Oshweken <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> actual team in the 2012 season. With only three teams, the league decided two teams should operate in each announced location, leading {{to the creation of}} the Iroquois Ironmen, Peel Avengers, and Durham TurfDogs. Rodney Hill operated the two Oshweken teams, but the league owned the other clubs initially.|$|R
25|$|Dee Gordon {{had three}} hits, {{including}} two triples, in the Dodgers 7–2 {{win over the}} Colorado Rockies at Coors Field on June 6. He was the first Dodgers player with two triples in a game since Rafael Furcal in 2010. Tim Federowicz hit a three-run homer the next day, but the Dodgers still lost 5-4 in 10 innings on a walk-off triple by Brandon Barnes. The {{final game of the}} Rockies series was called off after 5½ innings because of rain but the Dodgers were credited with a 6–1 win. Clayton Kershaw struck out nine batters in the five innings, becoming the first pitcher in Major League history to record four straight games of exactly nine strikeouts. The game was the Dodgers first regulation game called before nine innings since a 2004 game that was also at Coors Field. Scott Van Slyke hit two home runs and drove in four on June 9 as the Dodgers beat the Cincinnati Reds 6–2 at Great American Ball Park. Josh Beckett threw six shutout innings and the Dodgers racked up 12 hits in a 6–1 win over the Reds after a two-hour rain delay before the second game of the series. The Dodgers struck out 12 times, managed only four hits, and were shut out 5–0 by Johnny Cueto on June 11 and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series split after dropping a day game the following day, 4–1.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many people are making it out to be, but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else. But in my opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E
500|$|Songs of Innocence {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for [...] "aim for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 [...] "sounded as impersonal as ever" [...] {{and that the}} album was [...] "flat and strangely complacent", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was [...] "treading old ground without much {{of a sense of}} how to move forward." [...] Ben Patashnik of NME said only [...] "Iris", [...] "Song for Someone", and [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] were [...] "standouts", and he criticised the release strategy, judging [...] "the fact it's free makes it seem cheap." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was [...] "otherwise marred by the kind of slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: [...] "They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to be everything to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record that appeals to a narrow audience".|$|E
6000|$|Joe {{then went}} on to state, that the very last thing she should do was to jump from a window (a {{somewhat}} unnecessary piece of advice, poor Miss Denman thought), and that, when she was compelled to take such a step, she should first of all pitch over all the blankets and bedding she could lay hold of to make her fall easy. He <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emphatic reiteration of the assurance that her only chance lay in [...] "keeping cool." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a vein of {{philosophy}} in Wren's composition. He {{felt that he}} {{might just as well}} be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. In other words, having been caught down town without leave, he might as well stay there and enjoy himself a little while longer before going back to be executed. So he strolled off down the High Street, bought a few things at <b>a</b> stationer's, and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> excellent tea at the confectioner's by the post-office.|$|R
6000|$|The {{proceedings}} eventually closed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> brief {{speech from}} the king, who referred to Peterkin's remark about each man doing his duty, and said that, [...] "if each {{man did not}} do his duty--" [...] Here his majesty paused for a minute, and wrought his countenance into horrible contortions, indicative of the most excruciating agony, and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emphatic repetition of that dire threat about the unnatural treatment of eyes, heart, liver, and carcass, which had on the previous evening sounded so awful in our ears, and had been treated with such profound indifference by those whom it was specially designed to affect.|$|R

2500|$|Hana-Kimi's pilot episode {{started off}} strong, posting {{a rating of}} 3.05 Until the premiere of Show Luo and Barbie Xu's Corner With Love, Hana-Kimi was the ratings king in its time slot. Barbie Xu bet that Corner With Love's first episode would reach a ratings zenith of 2.9; however, she was off by quite a bit, as Corner <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mere 2.81, peaking at around 3.25. Corner With Love proved to be no match for Hana-Kimi in {{subsequent}} episodes, as the latter drama's ratings broke 5.0 by its twelfth episode. [...] Ratings-wise, Hana-Kimi was dominant for each of its 15 episodes, ending off with a finale that averaged around 5.98. In light of Hana-Kimi 's success, reports claimed that Selina and Wu would be acting in the sequel to It Started with a Kiss as a couple. However, {{the director of the}} sequel stepped out and debunked the rumor.|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 14 for a pitching matchup between Kershaw and Zack Greinke of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Kershaw allowed one run on four hits over 8 [...] innings while the Dodgers were not kind to their former pitcher and won 7–1. Puig homered {{and drove in}} four runs and Alex Wood pitched 3 [...] scoreless innings of relief as the Dodgers won 8–4 on Jackie Robinson Day. The Dodgers were unable to get much offense against Taijuan Walker and Rich Hill left his second {{start of the season}} with a flare up of his recurring blister problem as the team lost 3–1. The Diamondbacks <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series split thanks to Jake Lamb's tie-breaking homer in the 8th leading them to a 4–2 win. In the next game Nolan Arenado hit two homers off of a struggling Ryu and the Rockies beat the Dodgers 4–3. After a rough first inning, Kershaw struck out 10 in seven innings to help end the losing streak with a 4–2 win over the Rockies.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{a bicycle}} company making penny-farthings in 1874 under their {{original}} name: Bayliss, Thomas and Co, they later sold bicycles under {{the names of}} Excelsior and Eureka and changed the company name to Excelsior Motor Co. in 1910. In {{the early years of}} motor-bicycle manufacture they used Minerva, De Dion, MMC and possibly a Condor 850 cc single but went on to produce a wide range of machines with engines from most major manufacturers. In 1914, they offered a JAP-powered twin. A deal to supply the Russian Imperial government with motorcycles ended with the Revolution and Excelsior <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> excess inventory as a result.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{would make}} 6 more starts for the Rockies before being demoted to Triple <b>A.</b> Smith <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> {{finishing}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> record of 1-2 <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ERA of 6.23 in 39 innings. He also issued 24 walks with 31 strikeouts.|$|R

60|$|A scandal it assuredly did make, {{growing more}} scandalous as it spread, until the over-harbour people {{heard that the}} manse {{children}} had not only cleaned house and put out a washing on Sunday, but had <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> afternoon picnic in the graveyard while the Methodist Sunday School was going on. The only household which remained in blissful ignorance of the terrible thing was the manse itself; on what Faith and Una fondly believed to be Tuesday it rained again; {{for the next three}} days it rained; nobody came near the manse; the manse folk went nowhere; they might have waded through the misty Rainbow Valley up to Ingleside, but all the Blythe family, save Susan and the doctor, were away on a visit to Avonlea.|$|R

5000|$|During {{his best}} years of 1974 through 1978, Connors was {{challenged}} the most by Borg, with twelve matches on tour during that time frame. Borg won only four of those meetings, but two of those wins were in the Wimbledon finals of 1977 and 1978. Connors lost his stranglehold on the top ranking to Borg in early 1979 and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> official tour record of 8-15 against Borg. Although Borg is four years younger and won the last ten times they met, Connors won most exhibitions and senior tour matches against Borg, putting Connors [...] "unofficially" [...] ahead of Borg in overall wins (see Borg-Connors rivalry). Head to head in major championship finals, they split their four meetings, Borg winning two Wimbledons (1977 & 1978) and Connors winning two US Opens (1976 & 1978).|$|R
50|$|Soriano had an {{embarrassing}} {{moment in a}} day-night double header on Wednesday, August 13, 2008, where he hit a long ball which {{he thought was a}} home run. He watched it, and slowly trotted down to 1st, yet the ball never left the park. He <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> only <b>a</b> single.

60|$|I {{objected to}} this. Nothing is gained by {{collaboration}} in journalism when all {{deal with the}} same facts, {{so we went to}} work each according to his own lights. Keller triple-headed his account, talked about our 'gallant captain,' and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> allusion to American enterprise in that it was a citizen of Dayton, Ohio, that had seen the sea-serpent. This sort of thing would have discredited the Creation, much more a mere sea tale, but as a specimen of the picture-writing of a half-civilised people it was very interesting. Zuyland took a heavy column and a half, giving approximate lengths and breadths, and the whole list of the crew whom he had sworn on oath to testify to his facts. There was nothing fantastic or flamboyant in Zuyland. I wrote three-quarters of a leaded bourgeois column, roughly speaking, and refrained from putting any journalese into it for reasons that had begun to appear to me.|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, {{much to the}} disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when 'genius took to burning'. Jo had never tried this style before, contenting herself with very mild romances for The Spread Eagle. Her {{experience}} and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The manuscript was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.|$|R
