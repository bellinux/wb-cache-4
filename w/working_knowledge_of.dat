5|$|A <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> English {{has become}} a {{requirement}} {{in a number of}} occupations and professions such as medicine and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.|$|E
5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} mother {{language}} (first language learned), the 2006 census {{reported that in}} the Greater Montreal Area, 66.5% spoke French as a first language, followed by English at 13.2%, while 0.8% spoke both as a first language. The remaining 22.5% of Montreal-area residents are allophones, speaking languages including Italian (3.5%), Arabic (3.1%), Spanish (2.6%), Creole (1.3%), Chinese (1.2%), Greek (1.2%), Portuguese (0.8%), Romanian (0.7%), Vietnamese (0.7%), and Russian (0.5%). In terms of additional languages spoken, a unique feature of Montreal among Canadian cities, noted by Statistics Canada, is the <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> both French and English possessed by most of its residents.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, {{took charge of}} his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley soon {{gave up his}} apprenticeship, {{and after}} a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a City firm of solicitors. Here he picked up a <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> English legal procedures, and was soon {{carrying}} a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} obvious effects of the conquest was the {{introduction}} of Anglo-Norman, a northern dialect of Old French, as {{the language of the}} ruling classes in England, displacing Old English. French words entered the English language, and a further sign of the shift was the usage of names common in France instead of Anglo-Saxon names. Male names such as William, Robert and Richard soon became common; female names changed more slowly. The Norman invasion had little impact on placenames, which had changed significantly after earlier Scandinavian invasions. It is not known precisely how much English the Norman invaders learned, nor how much the knowledge of French spread among the lower classes, but the demands of trade and basic communication probably meant {{that at least some of}} the Normans and native English were bilingual. Nevertheless, William the Conqueror never developed a <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> English and for centuries afterwards English was not well understood by the nobility.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a good <b>working</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E

40|$|The lecture {{explored}} {{the area of}} overlap between the work of Szapocznikow and that of women Pop artists, notably the Belgian Evelyn Axell and British Pauline Boty (whose work {{was included in the}} exhibition). This reframing in relation to Pop brought out key issues about female subjectivity, and an autonomously experienced female sexuality and pleasure that both expanded the understanding of Szapcoznikow and further highlighted the fascinating confluence of concerns to be found among women artists <b>working,</b> without <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> each other, in the mid 20 th century...|$|R
50|$|Coverdale {{based his}} New Testament on Tyndale’s translation. For the Old Testament, Coverdale used Tyndale’s {{published}} Pentateuch and possibly his published Jonah. He {{apparently did not}} make use of any of Tyndale’s other, unpublished, Old Testament material (cf. Matthew Bible). Instead, Coverdale himself translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha. Coverdale used his <b>working</b> intermediate <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, not being a Hebrew or Greek scholar, he worked primarily from German Bibles - Luther’s Bible and the Swiss-German version (Zürich Bible) of Zwingli and Juda - and Latin sources including the Vulgate.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of gold {{from a more}} common element, such as lead, {{has long been a}} subject of human inquiry, and the ancient and medieval discipline of alchemy often focused on it; however, the transmutation of the chemical elements did not become possible until the understanding of nuclear physics in the 20th century. The first synthesis of gold was conducted by Japanese physicist Hantaro Nagaoka, who synthesized gold from mercury in 1924 by neutron bombardment. An American team, <b>working</b> without <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Nagaoka's prior study, conducted the same experiment in 1941, achieving the same result and showing that the isotopes of gold produced by it were all radioactive.|$|R
