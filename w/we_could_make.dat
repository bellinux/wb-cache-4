Recording took place at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland. The group made a brief list of {{producers}} they wished to work with, the first being Matt Squire. One of the band's main reasons for wanting to work with Squire was the label's rapport with him {{as a result of}} the success of Panic! at the Disco's debut, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). Janick sent Squire a demo of [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)." [...] Shaant Hacikyan recalls Squire was [...] "really excited about it.

Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me.

Other members of the I Love Bees team included Sean Stewart, a World Fantasy Award-award-winning author who served as I Love Bees writer, and Jim Stewartson, I Love Bees technical lead who produced the first commercial 3D game delivered by the internet. Weisman stated that the goal of I Love Bees was to utilize every person who interacted with the game, and to use any electronic resource to do so: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> your toaster print something we would.

500|$|Because Perfect Dark Zero was {{intended}} to be an Xbox 360 launch title, the last stage of development was very challenging and several features had to be canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline. The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32, and a [...] "dataDyne TV" [...] mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected. Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed. The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete. Rare later stated they felt very confident they would pass, but it was a significant risk producing 700,000 disks if a bug turned up. According to Botwood, [...] "very few people believed <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> launch, but everything came together in time and it was out there for day one." ...|$|E
500|$|The second album, Barrett, was {{recorded}} more sporadically than the first, with sessions taking place between February and July 1970. The album {{was produced by}} David Gilmour, and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Richard Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley. The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". One track ("Rats") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett's playing: [...] "He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic." [...] At times Barrett, who experienced synaesthesia, would say: [...] "Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish.

500|$|In early 1994, {{the film}} was in {{pre-production}} with Christopher [...] "Fangorn" [...] Baker as concept artist, and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it [...] "a feminist fairy-tale focus". Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A.I., but as Pinocchio. Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for A.I. {{can be seen on}} the DVD, The Work of Director Chris Cunningham. Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of [...] "little robot-type humans" [...] for the David character. [...] "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it look appealing," [...] producer Jan Harlan reflected. [...] "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [...] Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant.|$|E

[...] On March 16, 2016, the Russo stated the film was [...] "about {{a week and a half}} away from" [...] completion, with Joe adding that the film would have a post-credits scene, with the possibility for two or three total. The film was completed on April 4, 2016. Later in April, Alfre Woodard and Jim Rash were revealed to be cast in the film, while Feige explained that Black Panther director Ryan Coogler contributed some dialogue for Black Panther in several scenes during reshoots. At the film's premiere, it was revealed that Marisa Tomei appears in the film as May Parker, Peter Parker's aunt.|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make.</b> [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Allman and Walden first {{approached}} Betts {{with the}} idea of a reunion. Their first public appearance together came at a Great Southern show in New York's Central Park that summer, when Allman, Trucks, and Jaimoe joined the band for a few songs. Williams and Leavell declined to leave Sea Level, so the Allman Brothers Band hired two new members: guitarist Dan Toler and bassist David Goldflies. The band reunited with Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami to cut their reunion album, which was released in February 1979 as Enlightened Rogues, a term Duane had used to describe the band. While the band [...] "tried to make it happen," [...] they later concluded that the chemistry was not there; the album was a minor commercial success, which was credited to the production work from Dowd. Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties, and Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group. Betts won the lawsuit, and the rest of the band filed suit while Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October. Massarsky led the successful effort to sign the band with Arista, which pushed the band to [...] "modernize" [...] their sound. [...] " [...] Clive Davis destroyed any hope that we had that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> the thing work again," [...] said Trucks later. [...] "He wanted us to be a Southern American version of Led Zeppelin and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse." ...|$|E

500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then realized that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> his appearance serve the story {{in a way that we}} never could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E
500|$|Schlattmann {{thought to}} write the comic book store {{homicide}} storyline when {{he picked up the}} Aquaman snow globe in his office and thought, [...] "'Wow, this thing could easily be a murder weapon," [...] because of its weight and its edge. The writers wanted to use the actual Aquaman globe but DC Comics would not allow the character and the snow globe {{to be used in the}} episode, so the Dexter art department custom-made a snow globe. The superhero's name ultimately became [...] "Mariner" [...] as other names including [...] "Sea King" [...] and [...] "King of the Seas" [...] could not be used for legal reasons. Trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for the superhero based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. [...] "The Eradicator" [...] and [...] "Judge Justice" [...] were considered, but the final choice was [...] "The Dark Defender". Cerone said that the name was [...] "a little on the generic side, but it was one we could clear." [...] He said that The Dark Defender was in part an homage to [...] and [...] to Dexter's Dark Passenger, featured in Jeff Lindsay's series of Dexter novels on which the television series is based. On the poster, The Dark Defender, though hooded, was drawn with a smile to resemble Michael C. Hall. The poster was rendered by comic artist Tone Rodriguez, with whom Schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th Century Fox. When Schlattmann visited Rodriguez's studio in Los Angeles to discuss the art, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also there. Schlattmann thought that [...] "by including the two of them, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> things a bit more special and add some credibility to the show". Wickline played the dead comic book shopkeeper, while Rodriguez played the prime suspect for the murder. The Dark Defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized Dexter webisodes, recapping Dexter's victims of the second season.|$|E
