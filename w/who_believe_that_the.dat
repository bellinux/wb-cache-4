5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
5|$|The National Gallery {{has also}} been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's {{decision}} in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested {{by a group of}} art historians, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those {{who were involved in the}} purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.|$|E

They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E
5|$|While McClellan's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} over time, especially {{over the last}} 75 years, {{there is a small}} but intense cadre of American Civil War historians <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general has been poorly served on at least four levels. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen {{as a result of the}} Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, 'modernisers' in {{the party}} claimed that the {{association}} between social conservatism and the Conservatives (manifest in policies such as tax incentives for married couples, {{the removal of the}} link between pensions and earnings, and criticism of public financial support {{for those who do not}} work) played a role in the electoral decline of the party in the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Since 1997, a debate continued with{{in the party}} between 'modernisers' such as Alan Duncan, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives should modify their public stances on social issues, and 'traditionalists' such as Liam Fox and Owen Paterson, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party should remain faithful to its traditional conservative platform. This may have resulted in William Hague's and Michael Howard's pre-election swings to the right in 2001 and 2005, as well as the election of the stop-Kenneth Clarke candidate, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2001. Iain Duncan Smith, however, remains influential. It has been argued by analysts that his Centre for Social Justice forced Cameron to the right on many issues, particularly crime and social welfare.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{there is}} any {{historical}} reality behind the Trojan War remains an open question. Many scholars {{believe that there is}} a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. Those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.|$|E
25|$|The story centres on {{the widely}} made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those {{letters in the}} 'title' that have Roman numeral value are added {{together}} as in a chronogram), they produce the number 666, described in the Book of Revelation as the Number of the Beast (the Antichrist), who wears multiple crowns (identified by some as the triple tiara). This claim has been made by some Protestant sects <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope, {{as head of the}} Roman Catholic Church, is the Beast or the False Prophet mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However, a detailed examination of the existing tiaras shows no such decoration.|$|E
25|$|Among those <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term Gurjara was {{originally}} a tribal designation, there are disagreements over {{whether they were}} native Indians or foreigners.

Critics of the foreign origin theory argue that there is no conclusive evidence of their foreign origin: they were well-assimilated in the Indian culture. Moreover, if they invaded Indian through the north-west, it is inexplicable why would they choose to settle in the semi-arid area of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain.|$|E

25|$|Ownership and {{maintenance}} of the former surface alignment of US219 north of Peters Road—now known as Miller Road, and including the two-lane, high-level bridge that currently carries it across the valley surrounding Cattaraugus Creek—was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Erie and Cattaraugus counties. The two sections of road leading to and from the bridge were transferred immediately while the bridge itself was not turned over until a state-funded rehabilitation project was completed in 2013. The latter half of the plan drew criticism from Erie County officials <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state should continue to maintain the bridge due to its size, importance and the resulting cost of upkeep. Because of safety concerns, the bridge was closed to traffic on January5, 2012 and remained closed until April of that year while repairs were made to the structure.|$|E
25|$|Protestant literalists <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew {{text of the}} Old Testament is the {{inspired}} Word of God {{are divided}} {{on the question of}} whether or not the vowel points should be considered an inspired part of the Old Testament. In 1624, Louis Cappel, a French Huguenot scholar at Saumur, published a work in which he concluded that the vowel points were a later addition to the biblical text and that the vowel points were added not earlier than the fifth century AD. This assertion was hotly contested by Swiss theologian Johannes Buxtorf II in 1648. Brian Walton's 1657 polyglot bible followed Cappel in revising the vowel points. In 1675, the 2nd and 3rd canons of the so-called Helvetic Consensus of the Swiss Reformed Church confirmed Buxtorf's view as orthodox and affirmed that the vowel points were inspired.|$|E
25|$|Youth {{exclusion}} is multi-dimensional in that age, race, gender, {{class and}} lifestyle all affect youth life experiences {{within a given}} culture. This intersectionality affects {{the degree to which}} an individual youth experiences exclusion. Similarly, youth exclusion is context specific. This means that youth are excluded from society in different ways depending on their cultural and spatial locations. A simple difference between the opportunities and resources provided in one neighborhood can create a divide among youth who are included and youth who are excluded from their communities. Another consideration is that youth exclusion is relational insofar as social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and the excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economic support services and institutions that help the youth puts their own comfortable standard of living at risk. All of these demographic, cultural, spatial and relational factors contribute to the worldwide experiences of youth exclusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of qualia thus {{is governed by}} one's point of view, and that inevitably brings with it philosophical and neurophysiological presuppositions. The question, therefore, of what qualia can be raises profound issues {{in the philosophy of}} mind, since some materialists want to deny their existence altogether: on the other hand, if they are accepted, they cannot be easily accounted for as they raise the difficult problem of consciousness. There are committed dualists such as Richard L. Amoroso or John Hagelin <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mental and the material are two distinct aspects of physical reality like the distinction between the classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, there are direct realists for whom the thought of qualia is unscientific as {{there appears to be no}} way of making them fit within the modern scientific picture; and there are committed proselytizers for a final truth who reject them as forcing knowledge out of reach.|$|E
25|$|These criticisms {{are also}} voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, {{especially}} self-described democratic transhumanists, <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of current or future {{social and environmental}} issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) {{need to be addressed}} by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book , argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.|$|E
25|$|World War II {{casualties}} of the Soviet Union from all related causes numbered more than 20,000,000, both civilian and military, although the exact figures are disputed.

In 1993 {{a study by}} the Russian Academy of Sciences estimated that the total number of Soviet population losses due to the war was 26.6 million, including 8.7 million military deaths as calculated by the Russian Ministry of Defense. These figures have been accepted by most historians outside Russia. However, the official figure of 8.7 million military deaths has been disputed by some Russian historians <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of dead and missing POWs is underestimated. Officials at the Russian Central Defense Ministry Archive (CDMA) maintain that their database lists the names of roughly 14 million dead and missing service personnel. Some Russian politicians and journalists put the total number of losses in the war, both civilian and military, at over 40 million, however scholars outside of Russia believe that these figures are without serious foundation.|$|E
