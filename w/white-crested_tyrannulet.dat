50|$|The <b>white-crested</b> <b>tyrannulet</b> (Serpophaga subcristata) {{is a small}} {{species of}} bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in {{woodland}} and open habitats with scatted bushes and trees in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It {{is closely related to}} the white-bellied tyrannulet, but unlike that species the belly of the <b>white-crested</b> <b>tyrannulet</b> is yellow. The recently described Straneck's tyrannulet is extremely similar to the <b>white-crested</b> <b>tyrannulet</b> and was for a long time confused with that species; the two are generally best separated by voice.|$|E
50|$|The white-bellied tyrannulet (Serpophaga munda) {{is a small}} {{species of}} bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is found in open forest, {{woodland}} and various open habitats with scattered trees. It is closely related to, and by several authorities considered a subspecies of the <b>white-crested</b> <b>tyrannulet,</b> which has a yellow belly. There is complete intergradation between them in belly color {{and they do not}} seem to differ vocally. Another yellow-bellied (occasionally white-bellied) and on average shorter-tailed, vocally distinct species, the Straneck's tyrannulet, was for a period mistakenly referred to by the scientific name Serpophaga griseiceps, but that name is a junior synonym of Serpophaga munda.|$|E
50|$|The Straneck's tyrannulet (Serpophaga griseicapilla), {{also known}} as the monte tyrannulet and grey-crowned tyrannulet, is a small species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in {{woodland}} and open habitats with scatted bushes and trees in south-central South America, but the details are still unclear. It breeds in Argentina, but may also breed in Bolivia. In addition to these countries, it has been recorded as a non-breeding visitor in Paraguay, and possibly Brazil and Uruguay (it is unclear if it is a regular non-breeding visitor or only an accidental visitor to the last two countries). Visually it closely resembles the <b>white-crested</b> <b>tyrannulet,</b> but its voice is distinctive and its tail shorter. Considerable taxonomic confusion has surrounded this species, which for a period mistakenly was referred to by the scientific name Serpophaga griseiceps, a junior synonym of Serpophaga munda. Consequently, the Straneck's tyrannulet only received its scientific name in 2007 despite having been known since the early 1990s.|$|E
