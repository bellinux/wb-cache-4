All lying {{bright enough}} there; from Muhlberg to Judenberg, {{convenient}} to our glass; {{between us and the}} evening Sun. Batteries most abundant, difficulties great: Soltikof just ahead here, 72,000: Loudon at the Red Grange yonder, on their extreme left, with 18,000 more. An uncommonly strong position for 90,000 against 50,000. One thing strikes Friedrich: On front in this northern side, close by the base of the Russian Camp, runs--for the present away FROM Oder, but intending to join it elsewhere--a paltry little Brook, [...] "Hen-Floss" [...] so called, with at least two successive Mills on it (KLEINE MUHLE, GROSSE MUHLE); and on the northern shore of it, spilling itself out into a <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> called ELSBRUCH (Alder Waste), which is especially notable to Friedrich. ALDER Waste? Watery, scrubby; no passage there, thinks Friedrich; which his Peasant with the water-jug confirms. [...] "Tell me, however," [...] inquires Friedrich, with strictness, [...] "From the Red Grange yonder, where General Loudon is, if you wished to get over to the HOHLE GRUND, or to the Judenberg, would you cross that Hen-Floss?" [...] "It is not crossable, your Majesty; one has to go round quite westward by the Dam." [...] "What, from Rothe Vorwerk to Big Hollow, no passage, say you; no crossing?" [...] "None, your Majesty," [...] insists the Peasant;--who is not aware that the Russians have made one of firm trestles and logs, and use it daily for highway there; an error of some interest to Friedrich within the next twenty-four hours! ...|$|E

50|$|All {{membranes}} are porous to {{a limited}} extent so that, over time, low volumes of leachate will cross the membrane. The design of landfill membranes is at such low volumes that they should never have a measurable adverse impact {{on the quality of}} the receiving groundwater. A more significant risk may be the failure or abandonment of the leachate collection system. Such systems are prone to internal failure as landfills suffer large internal movements as waste decomposes unevenly and thus buckles and distorts pipes. If a leachate collection system fails, leachate levels will slowly build in a site and may even over-top the containing membrane and flow out into the environment. Rising leachate levels can also <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> masses that have previously been dry, triggering further active decomposition and leachate generation. Thus, what appears to be a stabilised and inactive site can become re-activated and restart significant gas production and exhibit significant changes in finished ground levels.|$|E

This study {{attempts to find}} the emission factor in windrow waste composting systems from two sizes of gathered organic waste piles. Designed to compare two groups of composting piles, one pile consisted of 500 kilograms of waste originating from local authorities while the other amounted to 250 kilograms of waste collected from households. With six piles of each type, aeration was done by manual turning and emissions were sampled in closed flux chambers and analyzed by gas chromatographs. A control experiment, modeling landfill sites, {{was set up in}} a one x one x one meter hole. Results from the experiment showed that emission ratios from the 500 kg was 1. 3613 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 <b>wet</b> <b>waste,</b> and 1. 3427 x 10 - 3 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> from the 250 kg experiment. The 500 kg experiment decreased emissions by 0. 059185 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> and the 250 kg experiment, emissions decreased by 0. 059206 g CO 2 -eq kg - 1 <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> when compared to the control group. In summary, pile size has no effect on emission ratios. Statistical testing found no significance difference between emissions from the 500 kg compared with the 250 kg.

40|$|This work {{refers to}} the {{development}} of an approach for planning <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> (food waste and other) collection at a metropolitan scale. Some specific modeling features distinguish this specific waste collection problem from the other ones. For instance, there may be significant differences as regards the values of the parameters (such as weight and volume) characterizing the various collection points. As it happens for classical waste collection planning, even in the case of <b>wet</b> <b>waste,</b> one has to deal with difficult combinatorial problems, where the determination of an optimal solution may require a very large computational effort, in the case of problem instances having a noticeable dimensionality. For this reason, in this work, a heuristic procedure for the optimal planning of <b>wet</b> <b>waste</b> is developed and applied to problem instances drawn from a real case study. The performances that can be obtained by applying such a procedure are evaluated by a comparison with those obtainable via a general-purpose mathematical programming software package, as well as those obtained by applying very simple decision rules commonly used in practice.

40|$|Comparing the {{alternatives}} of waste collection, transfer, transportation, transformation and treatment {{is a crucial}} stage, since each alternative is associated with different economic costs, impact on the environment, externalities and degree of public involvement. Unless we can combine all these "costs", we cannot choose the appropriate alternative. Our alternative cannot be to "do nothing". Doing nothing means to continue dumping waste in landfills, an option, which generates externalities, and (probably) is not the optimal alternative. The comparison is complicated since decisions in one stage imply on the desirable solutions in other stages. We deal with {{a system that has}} dependent components. For example, choosing the option of composting as one of the components of treatment (in addition to other methods for the remaining 60 % of waste, see Chapter 6) relies on the good quality of the organic material. If residents perform separation-at-source, and they are willing to cooperate and provide good separated material, then we don't need a MRF (see Chapter 4).

The feasibility of ethanol production from coffee waste by means of dilute sulfuric acid hydrolysis was investigated. Distilled water and different concentrations of sulfuric acid {{were used for the}} hydrolysis of coffee waste to determine the most efficient concentration of acid and to ensure maximum ethanol yield. The optimization study showed that the highest ethanol concentration of 6.12  g/L was obtained under the optimum conditions of hydrolysis with 0.4  M sulfuric acid for 1  h by keeping the temperature at 100  °C, and fermentation time of 24  h with commercial baker’s yeast. This study has clearly showed the possibility of producing ethanol from <b>wet</b> coffee <b>waste.</b> The utilization of <b>wet</b> coffee <b>waste</b> as an alternative energy production reduces the environmental pollution and dependence on oil and petroleum in Ethiopia.

But, the increasing amount of solid waste is rapidly filling existing land fills, and new sites are difficult to establish. Alternatives to land fills include the use of source reduction, recycling, composting and incineration, as well as use of land fills. Incineration is most economical if it includes energy recovery from the waste. Energy can be recovered directly from waste by incineration or the waste can be processed to produce storable refuse derived fuel (RDF). Information on the composition of solid wastes is important in evaluating alternative equipment needs, systems, management programs and plans. Household surveys are done in six divisions of Eluru Municipal Corporation, A. P, India and percapita waste for the corporation is estimated.
