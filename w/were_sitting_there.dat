5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E

Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{has contributed}} to {{numerous}} film screenplays. He wrote several jokes for the film Ice Age after The Simpsons colleague David Silverman asked him and Jon Vitti to help out with the film's story issues. He later wrote a number of screenplays including [...] and Horton Hears a Who!. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's My Life in Ruins, starring Nia Vardalos. Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy". Reiss defended the film: [...] "My Life in Ruins really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next hour. I know those [...] <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in that audience. They <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> going, 'These 1,498 people were wrong and the two of us are correct.' It makes me a little nuts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Furtwängler was {{required}} to submit to a process of denazification. He was charged with having conducted two Nazi concerts during the period 1933–1945. The first was for the Hitler Youth on 3 February 1938. It was [...] presented to Furtwängler {{as a way to}} acquaint younger generations with classical music. According to Fred Prieberg: [...] "when he looked at the audience he realized that this {{was more than just a}} concert for school kids in uniform; a whole collection of prominent political figures <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> as well [...] and it was the last time he raised his baton for this purpose".|$|E

60|$|He {{was hailed}} by a sentry as he {{approached}} the camp but, upon his reply, was allowed to pass. As he came to the light of a fire, round which the white officers <b>were</b> <b>sitting,</b> <b>there</b> was a general shout of surprise and pleasure.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{looked at}} Theodora's placid, finely-moulded face {{and tried to}} imagine what she herself would feel like if she <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> waiting for an elderly lover who had, seemingly, taken so long to make up his mind. But even Anne's {{imagination}} failed her for this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} known, when we <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in Harrods, {{that you were}} up against it, too, but I couldn't think of {{anything}} but the way I was fixed. The agent's been here twice this week for the rent, and I was kind of desperate for a square meal." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{great number}} of people <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> taking mysterious anodyne, doing the right thing; to avoid them, he kept along the rails, and ran almost {{into the arms of}} Colonel and Mrs. Ercott, who were coming from the {{direction}} of Knightsbridge, slightly flushed, having lunched and talked of 'Monte' at the house of a certain General.|$|E
60|$|While we were eating, the dervish {{happened}} {{to mention that}} in a spot only a little way off from where we <b>were</b> <b>sitting,</b> <b>there</b> was hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full {{as if it had}} never been touched.|$|E
60|$|Ten minutes later, a tall man, whom Gregory {{recognized}} at once as Sir Herbert Kitchener, whose {{figure was}} well known in Cairo, passed through the room; all who <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> rising to their feet, as he did so. He acknowledged the salute mechanically, as if scarcely conscious of it. An hour later a bell was rung, and an attendant went into the room. He returned directly.|$|E
60|$|It {{turned out}} that the report was true. Joan had relapsed. She <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in her chains, clothed again in her male attire.|$|R

60|$|But Diana and {{her small}} fry, the Echo Lodge {{people and the}} Allans, had stayed to help the two old ladies over the {{loneliness}} of the first evening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper time, sitting long {{around the table and}} chatting over all the details of the day. While they <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> Anne and Gilbert were alighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.|$|E
60|$|In the evening, {{when the}} ladies {{had gone to}} their rooms, they were again together; and Bertram thought that he would speak of Caroline. But he was again foiled. There had been some little bickering {{on the part of}} Mrs. Wilkinson. She had been querulous, and had not cared to hide it, though George and Adela <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> as guests. This had made her son unhappy, and he now spoke of it.|$|E
60|$|But in an hour's time Dan {{was still}} in good health, and {{announced}} his intention of going to bed. He went, and was soon sleeping as peacefully {{as if he had}} nothing on either conscience or stomach. But Felicity declared she meant to keep the water hot until all danger was past; and we sat up to keep her company. We <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> when Uncle Roger walked in at eleven o'clock.|$|E

6000|$|... ‘Uncle Jonathan,’ she said, {{getting up}} and taking him by the arm; ‘you sit down again, where you <b>were</b> <b>sitting.</b> <b>There,</b> sit still; I’ll have no more of this; you’ll do {{yourself}} a mischief. Come, take a drink of this good ale, and I’ll warm a tankard for you. La, we’ll pull through, you’ll see.

60|$|There was a {{fountain}} in the centre, {{with a large}} basin of water around it. Outside of this basin the square was paved with asphaltum, and was as hard and smooth as a floor. The pavement was shaded with trees, which were planted at equal distances all over it; and under the trees there were seats, where various persons <b>were</b> <b>sitting.</b> <b>There</b> were many children, too, playing about under the trees, some trundling hoop, some jumping rope, and some playing horses.|$|E
