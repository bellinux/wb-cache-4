In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, his idea of an English gentleman and his friend Gerard Fairlie.

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil <b>War,</b> <b>stories</b> of the Confederate {{gold and}} its vast wealth have been told and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E

5|$|In {{later life}} Lilly {{obtained}} a large atlas and marked {{the path of}} his movements in {{the war and the}} location of battles and skirmishes. He often used the atlas when telling <b>war</b> <b>stories.</b> His colonel's title stayed with him {{for the rest of his}} life, and his friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly served as chairman of the Grand Army of the Republic, a brotherhood of Union Civil War veterans, in 1893. During his term he helped organize an event that brought tens of thousands of Union war veterans, including Lilly's battery, together in Indianapolis for a reunion and a large parade.|$|E
5|$|Thinly populated, {{far from}} the colonial capital of Rio de Janeiro (which {{exercised}} little actual control), Rio Grande do Sul was often the target of invasions from its neighboring Hispanic-American colony, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina). Because the captaincy had to be self-sufficient, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul led lives as merchants, farmers or ranchers, while often also serving as soldiers or militiamen. Owners of large landholdings such as Marques de Sousa's father and grandfather provided food, equipment and protection for themselves and families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Marques de Sousa grew up in that hostile environment, and from {{a very young age}} he listened to <b>war</b> <b>stories</b> recounting the exploits of his relatives against Hispanic-American invaders.|$|E
5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the <b>war</b> <b>stories</b> he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E

25|$|In addition, war {{narratives}} {{were transformed}} into literature by (among others) the publishing houses, which distorted the perception {{and treatment of}} captivity. Nicolas Beaupré cites the letter of one of Éditions Berger-Levrault’s directors in which he insists on giving a direction to the publication of <b>war</b> <b>stories,</b> more for vainglory than a depiction of events: “Currently we, {{more than any other}} publishing house, are editing, as much at Nancy as in Paris, with very restrained means. If we can hold on and publish only good publications on the war, the House will emerge from the conflict in more of a starring role than before”. Still, sales for <b>war</b> <b>stories</b> quickly dropped as popular demand shifted elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|A {{prolific}} {{and versatile}} writer, Bierce {{was regarded as}} one of the most influential journalists in the United States, and as a pioneering writer of realist fiction. For his horror writing, Michael Dirda ranked him alongside Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. His <b>war</b> <b>stories</b> influenced Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, and others, and he was considered an influential and feared literary critic. In recent decades Bierce has gained wider respect as a fabulist and for his poetry.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, March {{returned}} to civilian life but experienced bouts {{of anxiety and}} depression, a common occurrence with returning veterans. The aforementioned experience, of having bayoneted a young, blond German soldier, is recounted in Company K, there attributed to Private Manuel Burt; March suffered hysterical attacks at different moments in his life related to the throat and the eyes. He rarely spoke of his own war experiences or awards, though he was later noted to always take his medals with him and to tell <b>war</b> <b>stories</b> on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Machen's strong {{opposition}} to a materialistic viewpoint is obvious in many of his works, marking him as part of neo-romanticism. He was deeply suspicious of science, materialism, commerce, and Puritanism, {{all of which were}} anathema to Machen's conservative, bohemian, mystical, and ritualistic temperament. Machen's virulent satirical streak against things he disliked has been regarded as a weakness in his work, and rather dating, {{especially when it comes to}} the fore in works such as Dr Stiggins. Similarly, some of his propagandistic First World <b>War</b> <b>stories</b> also have little appeal to a modern audience.|$|E
