5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles.

5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> looked like guests casually using their phones.

Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
