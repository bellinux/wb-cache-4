5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something because it is <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man– or some who thought Dickens had got it <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> needed to be corrected.|$|E
50|$|He {{is also a}} noted {{scholar in}} {{jurisprudence}} and legal philosophy, having introduced Civil Recourse Theory in the 1998 article Rights, <b>Wrongs,</b> <b>and</b> Recourse in the Law of Torts. Contrary to economic theorists, Zipursky argues that tort law is about legal <b>wrongs</b> <b>and</b> legal rights, not just about economic efficiency. Contrary to corrective justice theorists, he argues that private law is more about empowering individuals to seek redress for <b>wrongs,</b> <b>and</b> less about compensating for losses.|$|R

5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle changed the {{perception}} of the rebel movement in Mexico. Before Madero's victory many believed that the rebel forces would scatter {{as soon as they were}} confronted by federal troops.

5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to be <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> evil, {{he believed}} that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless {{of his or her}} background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went <b>wrong</b> <b>and,</b> in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E

5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is <b>wrong,</b> <b>and</b> if he {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer.

Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E

Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now, and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera.

Martha plays a joke on Jack, which goes <b>wrong</b> <b>and</b> he hits his head. At the hospital, Jack is told he is deaf. Jack blames Martha for the {{accident}} and they split up.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so far as they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been <b>wrong,</b> <b>and</b> preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E

The oppressor soon forgets. This robbery took place in 17[81]; it was in the year 1783 when he asserted that the waters of Lethe had been poured over all their <b>wrongs</b> <b>and</b> oppressions. Your Lordships will mark this insulting language, when he says that both the order of the Directors and the application of the Begums for redress must be solicitations to him.|$|R

5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly <b>wrong,</b> <b>and</b> he may have {{wanted to be sure}} he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E
5|$|Aflaq {{at first}} {{extended}} his {{support to the}} new government, believing {{that he and the}} Ba'ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be <b>wrong,</b> <b>and</b> one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party. The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba'ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.|$|E
