5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{suggested}} {{reviving the}} Order in 1943 to recognise {{the services of}} General The Hon. Sir Harold Alexander in Tunisia, but {{the opinion of the}} other ministers and civil servants <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin. Taoiseach Seán Lemass considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did not take a decision.|$|E

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around elapsed time after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second {{in the first stage}} and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath {{was killed}} in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> all eventually be confiscated.|$|E

50|$|One {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> save up to $3 {{billion in}} currency transactions. The same authors {{also stated that}} Canada's GDP could rise by up to 33 percent in a 20-year period given {{the adoption of a}} single currency.|$|R
50|$|The {{conclusion}} of these difficulties, particularly the last one, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> anything that produces general fear may be prohibited.

5|$|Initially Los Alamos was to {{have been}} a {{military}} laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer {{went so far as to}} order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California. Financial and procurement activities were the responsibility of the University of California under a 1 January 1943 letter of intent from the OSRD. This was superseded by a formal contract with the Manhattan District on 20 April 1943, which was backdated to 1 January. Financial operations were directed by the resident business officer, J. A. D. Muncy. The intent <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be militarized when the time came to finally assemble the bomb, but by this time the Los Alamos Laboratory had grown so large that this was considered both impractical and unnecessary, as the anticipated difficulties regarding civilians working on dangerous tasks had not occurred.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of SDI <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be effective against non-space faring weapons, namely cruise missiles, bombers, short-range ballistic missile submarines and non-conventional delivery methods.

25|$|In the 2000s, Grupo Walmart in Mexico {{began to}} {{construct}} a supermarket (Bodega Aurrerá) in the old section of Amecameca but INAH suspended construction.

25|$|The CTA has, {{within the}} past few years, {{installed}} GPS Bus Tracker systems on all buses.

25|$|Critics {{such as the}} National Coalition to Save Our Mall {{opposed the}} {{location}} of the memorial.

25|$|After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi {{and even}} {{mausoleum}} of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos.
