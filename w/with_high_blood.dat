The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the durian in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure are traditionally advised not to consume durian.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

40|$|Pain {{sensitivity}} {{is typically}} reduced in individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure although {{the nature of}} this relationship is poorly understood. Relatedly, the ingestion of sweet tasting solutions has been shown to reduce pain, possibly by an opioid mediated mechanism. The objective of the present research was to investigate the effects of blood pressure and sweet taste on pain sensitivity in healthy adults. The first aim was to test whether blood pressure interacts with sweet taste to affect pain sensitivity. The second aim was to test whether endogenous opioids mediate the effects of sweet taste and blood pressure on pain. In Study One, participants held sweet, bitter and plain water solutions in their mouths during exposure to a painful cold pressor test. Replicating previous research, individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure were found to have generally higher pain tolerance than those with lower blood pressure. Sweet taste was associated with an increase in pain tolerance but only in individuals with lower range blood pressure, increasing their tolerance to the level of those <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. In Study Two, participants held sweet solution, plain water or nothing in their mouths during cold pressors on two days. To test the involvement of endogenous opioids, participants were administered an opioid antagonist on one of the test days. Participants <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> resting <b>blood</b> pressure again showed increased tolerance and reduced unpleasantness ratings of the pain tasks, as well as dampened mood reactivity to the testing. In these individuals, the opioid antagonist reduced their pain tolerance and partially reversed their lower mood reactivity. As in Study One, sweet taste increased pain tolerance in participants with lower but not <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, but this was unaffected by opioid blockade. Taken together these results suggest some overlap between non-opioid mechanisms of sweet taste and blood pressure related analgesia. These results are also consistent with work suggesting that endogenous opioid activity {{may play a role in}} the reduced pain sensitivity, and perhaps mood reactivity, of individuals <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure and that multiple processes are involved in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia...|$|R
40|$|Subjects <b>with</b> <b>high</b> normal <b>blood</b> {{pressure}} are at {{high risk}} of developing hypertension. Thus, the criteria of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program for diagnosis of hypertension and recommendations for follow-up now recommend that patients <b>with</b> <b>high</b> normal <b>blood</b> pressure (130 mmHg to 139 mmHg systolic and/or 85 mmHg to 89 mmHg diastolic) be followed up annually for the development of hypertension. Clinical trial data from subjects <b>with</b> <b>high</b> normal <b>blood</b> pressure show that 40 % over two years and 63 % over four years developed hypertension (140 / 90 mmHg or higher). These data are consistent with observational data from the Framingham Heart Study, which found a similar risk. Besides annual follow-up, the Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommends lifestyle therapy for individuals <b>with</b> <b>high</b> normal <b>blood</b> pressure.

5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> lead concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is {{progressive}} loss in kidney function {{over a period}} of months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are not specific, and might include feeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic kidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at risk of kidney problems, such as those <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure or diabetes and those with a bloodline relative with CKD. This disease may also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications, such as cardiovascular disease, anemia, pericarditis or renal osteodystrophy (the latter included in the novel term CKD-MBD). CKD is a long-term form of kidney disease; thus, it is differentiated from acute kidney disease (acute kidney injury) in that the reduction in kidney function must be present for over 3 months. CKD is an internationally recognized public health problem affecting 5–10% of the world population.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the causes of prostate cancer remains elusive. The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. Prostate cancer is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. However, many men never know they have prostate cancer. Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found prostate cancer in 30% of men in their fifties, and in 80% of men in their seventies. Men who have first-degree family members with prostate cancer appear to have double the risk of getting the disease compared to men without prostate cancer in the family. This risk appears to be greater for men with an affected brother than for men with an affected father. In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths due to prostate cancer. Men <b>with</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure are more likely to develop prostate cancer. There is a small increased risk of prostate cancer associated with lack of exercise.
