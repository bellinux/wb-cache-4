5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, {{it came to}} be seen as {{unlikely}} that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of field fortifications was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese at Rock Springs {{were aware}} of the {{animosity}} and rising racial tension with white miners, but had not taken any precautions, as no prior events indicated there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> race riots. Underlying the outbreak of violence were racism and resentment of the policies of the Union Pacific Coal Department. Until 1875, the mines in Rock Springs were worked by whites; in that year, a strike occurred, and the strikers were replaced with Chinese strikebreakers less than two weeks after the strike began. The company resumed mining with 50 white miners and 150 Chinese miners in its employ. As more Chinese arrived in Rock Springs, bitterness from the white miners increased. At the time of the massacre, there were about 150 white miners and 331 Chinese miners in Rock Springs.|$|E
5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E

5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E

25|$|The treaty {{terms were}} {{presented}} to the Sultan {{in the middle of}} June. The treaty was harsher than anyone expected. However, because of the military pressure placed on the insurgency from April to June 1920, the Allies did not expect that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> serious opposition.|$|E
25|$|As {{there are}} hardly any {{characteristics}} of Celtic law that cannot {{be found in}} at least some other, non-Celtic laws as well, the most sensible definition of Celtic law seems to be one that focuses on the language in which the law is (usually) dispensed. As such, 'Celtic law' <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> law (usually) dispensed in a Celtic language.|$|E

25|$|Later reports {{indicated}} that 400 US {{troops would be}} deployed in Paraguay over 18 months for training and humanitarian missions consisting of 13 detachments numbering less than 50 personnel each. The Paraguayan administration as well as Bush's administration denied that the airport would {{be used as a}} US military base, or that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> other US base in Paraguay.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of perhaps a hundred common or generic plant and animal names, Esperanto adopts the international binomial nomenclature of living organisms, using suitable orthography, and changing the nominal and adjectival grammatical endings to -o and -a. For example, the binomial for the guineafowl is Numida meleagris. In Esperanto, therefore, a numido <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> bird of the genus Numida, and a meleagra numido the helmeted guineafowl specifically. Likewise, a numidedo is any bird in the guineafowl family Numididæ.|$|E
25|$|In October 1954, Kelsey {{was a key}} {{member of}} the Research Airplane Committee which underwrote the North American X-15. The committee, headed by Hugh Dryden, {{evaluated}} the proposed Mach7 hypersonic aircraft design which aimed to reach altitudes of 300,000ft. On the committee, Kelsey was sole representative for the Air Force, Dryden represented NACA, and two rear admirals represented the Navy. Dryden convinced the committee to move ahead with the project {{even though it was}} not clear there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> military value gained from it.|$|E

25|$|As was {{expected}} {{in light of}} Bunning's previous career as a baseball player, {{he has been very}} interested in Congress's investigation of steroid use in baseball. Bunning was also outspoken on the issue of illegal immigration, taking the position that all illegal immigrants should be deported. Bunning was also {{the only member of the}} United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to have opposed Ben Bernanke for Chief of the Federal Reserve. He said it was because he had doubts that Bernanke <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> different from Alan Greenspan.|$|E
25|$|In the 11th century, {{there were}} three conquests and some Anglo-Saxon people would live through it: one in the {{aftermath}} of the conquest of Cnut in 1016; the second after the unsuccessful attempt of battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066; the third after that of William of Normandy in 1066. The consequences of each conquest can only be assessed with hindsight. In 1016, no-one was to know that whatever cultural ramifications were felt then, they would be subsumed half a century later; and in 1066 there was nothing to predict that the effects of William's conquest <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> greater or more lasting than those of Cnut's.|$|E
25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do. It did not seem that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> {{way for them to}} afford to develop a new computer, given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one. When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed capital, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cray's reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the success}} that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still {{struggling}} to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two. He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit that has been driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> reason for the adult bull shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E
25|$|Constant cavalry {{and naval}} skirmishing {{had been going}} on since March 21. On April 2, Brigadier General Albert Lindley Lee's {{division}} of Union cavalry collided with 1,500 arriving Confederate Texas cavalrymen. These Confederates would continue to resist any Union advance. Union intelligence, meanwhile, had determined that there were additional forces besides Taylor and the cavalry up the road from them. All of the senior Union officers expressed doubts that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> serious Confederate opposition, except for the naval flotilla. Banks' army followed Taylor and the cavalry into a dense pine forest area away from the river, probably to keep them in their front. Approaching Pleasant Hill, the Union army was excessively strung out due both to the existence of only a few camping areas with water and the lack of monitoring of the position of the rear elements. Taylor kept moving back toward Shreveport.|$|E
