Having found Halder's plans unsatisfactory from the very beginning, Hitler ordered a change of strategy on 13 February in accordance with Manstein's thinking, having heard an outline. The general was invited to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to explain his plans to Hitler on 17 February, during a <b>working</b> <b>lunch</b> {{in the presence of}} Alfred Jodl and Erwin Rommel. Though Hitler felt an immediate antipathy against Manstein for being too arrogant and aloof, he listened speechlessly to his exposition and was impressed by Manstein's logic. [...] "Certainly an exceptionally clever fellow, with great operational gifts, but I don't trust him" [...] Hitler remarked after Manstein had left.|$|E

The Labour government was challenged in Parliament about [...] "trips, facilities, gifts and other offerings of financial value provided by Monsanto to civil servants", but only acknowledged that Department of Trade and Industry had two <b>working</b> <b>lunches</b> with Monsanto.

As well, demotivated employees may stay at their desks to eat their lunch {{to give the impression}} that they are <b>working</b> through the <b>lunch</b> hour; in fact, they may be sending personal e-mails or reading online articles unrelated to work. An employee who spends the afternoon on personal phone calls may learn how to mask this by sounding serious and professional during their responses, {{to give the impression that}} it is a work-related call.

3000|$|Multilayer network models {{provide a}} {{powerful}} and realistic tool {{for the analysis of}} complex real-world network systems, enabling an in-depth understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of multiple, interconnected types of node relations and interactions (Dickison et al. 2016). While they {{can be seen as a}} form of HIN (cf. “Heterogeneous information networks” section), the main idea here is to model the different relations which may occur between the same set of entities in different layers. The layers can be seen as different interaction contexts, while the participation of an entity to different layers can be seen as a set of different instances of the same entity. When the only inter-layer edges (i. e. edges linking instances in different layers) are the coupling edges (i. e. edges linking different instances of the same entity), this model is generally referred to as Multiplex Network. As a practical example, in social computing, an individual often has multiple accounts across different social networks. Multilayer networks can be easily used to link distributed user profiles belonging to the same user from multiple platforms, thus enabling the definition of advanced mining tasks, e. g. multilayer community detection (Kim and Lee 2015; Loe and Jensen 2015). Similarly, different layers can be used to model online and offline relations of different types happening in a social network (Gaito et al. 2012; Dunbar et al. 2015), such as followship, like/comment interactions, <b>working</b> relationship, <b>lunch</b> relationship, etc. A multilayer network model which has become very popular in literature is that proposed by Kivela et al.
