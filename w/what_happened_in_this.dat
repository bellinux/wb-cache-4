He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he {{would have done the same}} had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E

The following week, a request for evidence and documentation supporting Razack's argument was made to Raj Anand, the lawyer representing {{the families of the}} deceased. The lawyer refused to give these documents, calling the demand [...] "ironic" [...] since Razack's report on systemic racism was the only report whose validity was being questioned, and for which supporting evidence was requested, which Anand claimed was a result of systemic racism. The Department of Justice lawyer who made the request, Barnand Brukney, expressed his impression that racism had {{very little to do with}} how the Canadian government handled the Air India Flight 182, telling Razack in court that she [...] "really [...] know <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case."
