5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Norman Alexander spent time in both Singapore and New Zealand, whilst Elizabeth Alexander {{returned}} to England. In 1947, when the children <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took {{on the role of}} Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in Agronomy, soil science, and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Just three weeks into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E
5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family – Princes William and Harry each had one {{to drive around}} Kensington Palace before they <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, {{some of the early}} buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females {{might have left}} their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> join herds, {{which is similar to}} the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the emigrants were running low on water and provisions, and allowed some {{approaching}} members of the militia—who carried a white flag—to enter their camp. The militia members assured the emigrants they were protected and escorted them from the hasty fortification. After walking {{a distance from the}} camp, the militiamen, with the help of auxiliary forces hiding nearby, attacked the emigrants and killed all of them that they thought <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be potential witnesses to report the attack.|$|E

At the age of 12, she and Martha <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have a more advanced education, and they were sent to Elizabeth Sedgwick's 'School for Young Ladies' in Lenox, Massachusetts. The influence of this school was to them both a lasting benefit. On {{the return of the}} two sisters from Lenox, their pastor Rev. Abiel Abbott Livermore and his wife were invited to make the Perry family mansion their home. Lowe occupied her leisure with riding, driving, and singing. After a year at home, she went to Boston, to take piano lessons. Her first winter was spent with the family of Mrs. George Bond, one of the ladies of Boston society. Her second winter in Boston was devoted to lessons in singing, and she stayed in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Henry I. Bowditch.|$|E

500|$|The {{traditional}} female homemaker–male breadwinner model characterized {{female employment}} prior to World War II. At {{the turn of}} the 20th century in the continental United States, only 18 percent of women over the age of 15 reported receiving income non-farm employment. These women were typically young, single, white, and native-born. In contrast, married women in the non-farm labor force were [...] "predominantly blacks or immigrants and very poor".

500|$|In 2011, the French {{conservative}} media Nouvelles de France {{revealed that}} Jonathan Krohn was not conservative anymore. In 2012, he confirmed to Politico {{that he no}} longer considers himself a conservative, and in fact takes a liberal point of view on many issues, including same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act. He also said that if he <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> vote in the 2012 presidential election, he would vote for Barack Obama. However, he refused to describe himself as liberal, instead rejecting ideological labels entirely. Krohn attributes his change to reading works of philosophers such as Nietzsche and Wittgenstein. He said that he rejected social conservatism first, before rejecting other conservative viewpoints. Krohn stated that he had matured and described his 13-year-old self as [...] "naive".|$|E

In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored to be in it. Of course, I'd {{like to be the}} romantic lead, and I'm actually closer to Michael's [...] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [...] I think it's always worked that way in Hollywood. When I was in my 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, all of whom <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be my father." [...] The Game proved to be a major success among Baker's later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

Mistakenly believing Jimbo {{was the one who had}} been pranking Moe throughout the entire series, he races into the Simpson house with a kitchen knife looking for Jimbo, causing Jimbo to cry and plead for his life. Afterwards, Laura breaks up with him for not being the tough [...] "outlaw" [...] she thought he was. Laura tells Bart that she would date him if he <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> grow a mustache and the episode ends with the pair laughing after prank-calling Moe again.|$|E

500|$|By the 1930s, the {{international}} community believed {{that the bulk of}} the Brazilian Navy was [...] "obsolete" [...] and <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> no longer be [...] "considered effective." [...] Still, Minas Geraes was modernized a second time at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard from June 1931 to April 1938. Plans to give similar treatment to São Paulo were dropped due to the ship's poor material condition. During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which placed restrictions on the sale of used warships to foreign countries. The Brazilians eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom. In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions. Three s, based on the American , were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.|$|E
