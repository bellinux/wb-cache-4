500|$|Prior to its release, the Kinks {{performed}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] in some {{of their}} early concerts. It was a crowd favourite, with Ray Davies later claiming to feel a connection with the crowd as he performed the song. Ray later said, [...] "Our success came from playing [...] live. When we played 'You Really Got Me' people actually took notice. They realised <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> original." ...|$|E
500|$|The Who {{had planned}} to perform Tommy live since {{starting}} the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs ("Cousin Kevin", [...] "Underture", [...] "Sensation" [...] and [...] "Welcome") were dropped entirely. Townshend later said the group [...] "did the whole thing {{from start to finish}} and that was when we first realized <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> cohesive and playable." [...] Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.|$|E

500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense".|$|E
500|$|Co-executive {{producers}} David H. Goodman and Andrew Kreisberg wrote [...] "Unearthed", while producer Frederick E. O. Toye {{worked as}} the episode director. [...] "Unearthed" [...] {{was the last}} episode filmed during the first season schedule. Although it was filmed during the first season, [...] "Unearthed" [...] aired during the following season on Monday, January 11, 2010, a departure from its normal timeslot on Thursdays. Actor Joshua Jackson explained the move in April 2009, [...] " [...] for boring reasons. They only had 22 airdates for our show this year, but they ordered 23 episodes, so we shot one for next year, which is just silly TV network stuff. It's not for any cool reason like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> we needed in New York that we couldn't shoot elsewhere. It's just an accounting issue." [...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes. It's a stand-alone, but it still honors the condition that we know it will fall into the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2005, {{the band}} {{announced}} the album's title and {{revealed that the}} title track, [...] "Lights and Sounds", was confirmed {{to be the first}} single from the album, with a video shot in Van Nuys, California and a release date of November 15. On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, you know, so obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either go on without him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we decided that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> too great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him." [...] Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez.|$|E

500|$|Spending {{their own}} money, N.E.R.D {{recorded}} the album at the South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida, and the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California. Williams used a Triton Extreme, Triton Pro and Pro Tools {{in the production}} of the album, while Hugo worked in Access Virus TI, Roland JV-1080, JV-2080, XV-5080, TR-808 and TR-909 as beatboxing was provided by Haley. Rock band Spymob further assisted production with guitar and drums. Production revolved around heavy rock, funk and soul music, which was first introduced in their debut album, In Search Of.... Hugo described the album as going back to the band's roots, combining a classic rock sound with a 1970s funk swing. The typical process of recording was described as [...] "Williams arrives at the studio, ideas in full flower, and lays down both a beat (either programmed or played on an assortment of buckets) and vocals." [...] Hugo then would add extra instrumentation. In an interview with MTV, Williams said that the band [...] "didn't care about genres; we're not doing this for the money. We're doing this for people who pledge allegiance to our movement." [...] Hugo {{went on to say that}} they [...] "just want to make people move". On the album he said, [...] "We had anger, quiet angst. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to get off our chest. And we wanted to show we could do it as a band." [...] Don Was, a musician and record producer, thought that the band was on a creatively fulfilling path, calling their musical style [...] "really innovative".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with CNN, Thompson's daughter Katherine McIntosh recalled how {{her mother was}} a [...] "very strong lady", and [...] "the backbone of our family".

2500|$|Having {{returned}} to the UK from the United States in August 1976, Slade found themselves out-of-favour {{at the time of}} the UK's Punk rock explosion. The band's 1977 album Whatever Happened to Slade proved a commercial failure while their tour that spring had shown that they could no longer fill large venues. Slade's waning success soon led to the band taking any gig they could. They found themselves playing small venues, mainly universities and clubs. The band's tours often ran at a loss, with the band having to bring their own PA and lightshow. Bassist Jim Lea however was unphazed. [...] "I still thought the band was great," [...] he told Chris Charlesworth in 1983, [...] "We were playing as well if not better than we ever had... now <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to prove again." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Insatiable", the album's title track, {{served as}} the lead single upon its release on 1 November. Upon release, the track {{garnered}} heavy critical praise. Co-written with Guy Chambers and produced by newcomer Ricci Riccardi, BBC said the song [...] "showcases a harder, guitar-led sound for the pop singer." [...] It {{is said to be}} [...] "ballsy and Eighties-influenced", receiving comparisons to The Bangles. Nadine said she {{knew it was going to}} be a hit as soon as they finished it, because it was so catchy. She said, [...] "I just knew <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> special when we wrote that song." [...] A clip of the single appeared on Nadine's website on 6 September. The song received its official world premiere on [...] on 10 September. The music video, directed by Wayne Isham, was filmed in Los Angeles. The video premiered on 3 October. The single entered the UK singles chart at number 26 selling 11,392 copies. [...] "Insatiable" [...] entered the Irish top 50 at number 20.|$|E
2500|$|Without the {{guidance}} and songwriting that Bacharach/David had provided, Warwick's career stalled in the 1970s. There were no big hits during the decade, aside from 1974's [...] "Then Came You", recorded as {{a duet with}} the Spinners and produced by Thom Bell. Bell later noted, [...] "Dionne made a (strange) face when we finished [...] She didn't like it much, but I knew <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something.</b> [...] So we ripped a dollar in two, signed each half and exchanged them. I told her, 'If it doesn't go number one, I'll send you my half.' [...] When it took off, Dionne sent hers back. There was an apology on it." [...] It was her first U.S. #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Other than this success, Warwick's five years on Warner Bros. Records produced no other major hits. Two notable songs recorded during this period were [...] "His House and Me" [...] and [...] "Once You Hit The Road" [...] (#79 pop, #5 R, #22 Adult Contemporary), {{both of which were}} produced in 1975 by Thom Bell.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 January 2006, it was {{announced}} that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, Studio 1. The first single, [...] "Rock Steady" [...] (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Studio 1 entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, [...] "Chick Fit" [...] failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for the money. We got signed before we had even made music again, it wasn't like we felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking about it too hard". She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that [...] "it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; {{there was a lot of}} compromise involved".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, Guillermo del Toro {{signed on}} as {{executive}} producer. Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone â€“ our emergency phone â€“ and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss â€“ an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E
2500|$|Limestone Lad {{began his}} racing career {{competing}} in National Hunt Flat races, {{also known as}} [...] "bumpers". On his debut at Naas Racecourse on 12 February 1997, he started at odds of 20/1 and finished ninth of the twenty four runners, eighteen lengths behind the winner Mount Druid. He was well beaten in further bumpers at Naas (behind the future Grand National winner Amberleigh House), Cork and Thurles, before recording his first success in a race confined to female riders at Limerick Racecourse on 27 December. Ridden by Aileen Sloan-Lee he won [...] "easily" [...] by nine lengths from thirteen opponents at odds of 6/1. Michael Bowe later recalled [...] "I suspected <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> exciting on our hands when he won that day. My lasting memory after that race was holding him in the car park, giving him a piece of grass with a band playing in the background. They were playing Perfect Day - and it was". In January 1998 he finished a distant third at Navan Racecourse and then finished sixth of the ten runners at Gowran Park. On his final appearance in a bumper, the gelding led from the start to win an eleven runner contest at Naas, beating the mare Our Meg by {{two and a half}} lengths.|$|E
