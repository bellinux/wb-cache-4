Performances were {{scheduled}} to run on the centre's Motel stage between February 23 and March 5. Tickets quickly sold out. Four days after the premiere, Burnt Thicket Theatre moved the play to the Scott Block Theatre in Red Deer, where the play was scheduled to be performed until March 12. All the performances in Red Deer were sold out. The play drew emotional reactions from the audience. Kooman learned that some audience members at the initial performances later responded to the play by talking with others about human trafficking, writing letters to their Members of Parliament, and doing other creative things on the subject. They also contacted Waldschmidt, sometimes up to a year later, <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> how the play had continued to affect their lives. In conjunction with the initial run of She Has a Name, Burnt Thicket Theatre provided the names of organizations that assist human-trafficking victims. There was also a panel discussion about human trafficking after the matin√©e on February 26.|$|E

25|$|Penthouse {{magazine}} began {{publication in}} 1965, in the UK and in North America in 1969, {{an attempt to}} compete with Hugh Hefner's Playboy. Guccione offered editorial content that was more sensational than that of Playboy, and the magazine's writing was far more investigative than Hefner's upscale emphasis, <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> government cover-ups and scandals. Writers such as Craig S.

25|$|The {{fact that}} the Polish Jewish {{community}} was destroyed during World War II, coupled <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> Polish collaborators, has contributed, especially among Israelis and American Jews, to a lingering stereotype that the Polish population has been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. However, modern scholarship has not validated the claim that Polish antisemitism was irredeemable or different from contemporary Western antisemitism; it has also found that such claims are among the stereotypes that comprise anti-Polonism. The presenting of selective {{evidence in support of}} preconceived notions have led some popular press to draw overly simplistic and often misleading conclusions regarding the role played by Poles {{at the time of the}} Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|Jason Mantzoukas made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] as the fragrance maker Dennis Feinstein. The character {{and some of}} his fragrance brands have been mentioned in previous Parks and Recreation episodes, but this marked his first on-screen appearance. Mantzoukas portrays the character Rafi in the FX comedy series The League; he is the third character from that show to appear on Parks and Recreation, as Nick Kroll previously guest-starred in the episode [...] "Media Blitz", and Paul Scheer appeared in the episode [...] "Kaboom". [...] "Indianapolis" [...] included a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past, all of which were edited together in a series of jump cuts.

500|$|Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse [...] ( [...] ; 15 October 188114 February 1975) was an English {{author and}} one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British {{magistrate}} based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years. They include the jolly gentleman of leisure Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> golf; and Mr Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.|$|E
500|$|Smallvilles first {{venture into}} comics was [...] "Elemental", a one-off story by Gough and Millar which {{appeared}} in TV Guide during the series' first season and set in that period. Before the start of season two, DC Comics published a one-off comic based on the series. Entitled Smallville: The Comic, it has two stories. The first, [...] "Raptor" [...] by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez, is about an abused boy who mutates into a raptor (thanks to kryptonite) and tries to get revenge on the Luthor family. Michael Green and John Paul Leon wrote [...] "Exile and The Kingdom", with insight into why Lex remains in Smallville after his father offers him a position in Metropolis {{at the end of}} season one. DC Comics then began publishing a bimonthly comic <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> Smallville characters. Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter called the comic-book line a companion to the series rather than a non-canonical version. According to Carpenter, the comic-book line expands on events in the series (such as season-ending cliffhangers) and gives [...] "additional depth" [...] to characters with limited screen time on the series or whose storylines needed additional explanation.|$|E

500|$|As in {{previous}} seasons, filming {{of the third}} season of the series included {{a large amount of}} improvisation from the cast. For example, during one scene in [...] "The Fight" [...] in which almost the entire cast becomes intoxicated at the Snakehole Lounge bar, each actor spent about two days on their own filming their own individual scenes. Much of the filming was improvised, including shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become {{by the end of the}} night. Amy Poehler described the filming as [...] "the most fun I've ever had". Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally also improvised a great deal of their scenes during the filming of [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two". The third season continued to use several visual and camera techniques that had been introduced in past seasons. In the past, Poehler would improvise several different jokes during a take, and they would be intermingled into a montage of jump cuts featuring many of the jokes. That technique was used prominently in [...] "Indianapolis" [...] during a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann <b>with</b> <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past. The same technique was used by Aziz Ansari in [...] "Soulmates", during a scene in which Tom describes many slang nicknames he has given to foods, and in [...] "The Fight", in which Tom describes many strange entrepreneurial idea he has come up with.|$|E

[...] "The rocks have a tortured appearance," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "abrupt, sharp shapes, angled striations, rapid shifts of colour from pink to white, rust, green, grey, black.
