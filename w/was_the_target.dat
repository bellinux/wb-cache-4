5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School {{in order to build}} the project in the first place. Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were incompatible with typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 1916, Bolton <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> for an aerial offensive. L21, a Zeppelin {{commanded}} by Oberleutnant Kurt Frankenburg of the Imperial German Navy, dropped twenty-one bombs on the town, five {{of them on the}} working class area of Kirk Street, killing thirteen residents and destroying six houses. Further attacks followed on other parts of the town, including three incendaries dropped close to the Town Hall.|$|E
5|$|For {{his part}} in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves, swords and {{diamonds}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg, East Prussia on 19 July 1944. The next day, Hitler <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of the 20 July plot. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram to Hitler reaffirming his loyalty.|$|E

5|$|His wife <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of an {{attempted}} assassination in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. After the shooting, in which six people were killed, both Kelly and Giffords were {{thrust into the}} media spotlight. His wife's shooting led to a broad national conversation ranging from the duties of a husband to what is acceptable civil discourse.|$|E
5|$|In September 1992 {{the museum}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two {{incendiary}} devices {{were found in}} a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff {{before the arrival of}} the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1921, when Piłsudski visited Lwów (now Lviv) for {{the opening}} of the first Eastern Trade Fair (Targi Wschodnie), he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of an {{unsuccessful}} assassination attempt by Stepan Fedak, acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the Ukrainian Military Organization.|$|E
50|$|Pipelines can <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of vandalism, sabotage, or even {{terrorist}} attacks. In war, pipelines <b>are</b> often <b>the</b> <b>target</b> {{of military}} attacks, as destruction of pipelines can seriously disrupt enemy logistics.|$|R

5|$|On August 22, 1873, Sarmiento <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of an {{unsuccessful}} assassination attempt, when two Italian anarchist brothers shot at his coach. They {{had been hired}} by federal caudillo Ricardo López Jordán. A year later in 1874, he completed his term as President and stepped down, handing his presidency over to Nicolás Avellaneda, his former Minister of Education.|$|E
5|$|With {{the basic}} concept proven, the team then {{looked for a}} {{suitable}} aircraft to carry the receiver. Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, a reversal of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal electrical noise.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt}} to disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E

5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle. There {{is a record}} of a small {{individual}} caught off Argentina that bore bite marks from a copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) or similar species, but it is uncertain whether the porbeagle <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of attempted predation or if the two were simply involved in interspecific aggression. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} its land area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates these events each year on July 9, with the ringing of the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in these events.|$|E

5|$|In {{the regular}} season finale of 2001, Favre <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of minor {{controversy}} when, {{in a game against}} the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984. The controversy (Favre fell over unusually easily) has followed Strahan continuously since he set the record. Jim Fassel, Strahan's coach in 2001, said that when a respected athlete like Strahan gets close to an all-time record, sometimes opponents want him to break it.|$|E
5|$|Other {{diversion}} operations included 40 Lancasters, 19 Halifaxes and 35 Vickers Wellingtons from No. 7 Group RAF flying {{toward the}} Frisian Islands. Some aircraft withdrew owing to mechanical difficulties but 91 dropped 3,721 bundles of Window over the North Sea. Five Halifaxes, three B-24 Liberators and eight B-17 Flying Fortress also assisted with jamming operations. The USAAF committed 24 B-24s to bomb Emden {{in support of}} the main force. In the final pre-amble to the main attack No. 100 Group committed 10 Halifaxes and six Mosquitos to drop target markers over Meppen to mislead German ground controllers into believing it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target.</b> The bombers struck Ladbergen, and the canal burst its banks, the safety gates were overwhelmed and canal boats were stranded. The attack lasted just 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because it}} was the lead cruiser in the U.S. formation, Atlanta <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of fire and torpedoes from several Japanese ships—probably {{including}} Nagara, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi—in addition to Akatsuki. The gunfire caused heavy damage to Atlanta, and a type 93 torpedo strike cut all of her engineering power. The disabled cruiser drifted into the line of fire of SanFrancisco, which accidentally fired on her, causing even greater damage. Admiral Scott and many of the bridge crew were killed. Without power and unable to fire her guns, Atlanta drifted out of control and out of the battle as the Japanese ships passed her by. The lead U.S. destroyer, Cushing, was also caught in a crossfire between several Japanese destroyers and perhaps Nagara. She too was hit heavily and stopped dead in the water.|$|E

5|$|Ruth's legendary {{power and}} charismatic {{personality}} {{made him a}} larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|E
5|$|The Keating Five {{were five}} United States Senators accused of {{corruption}} in 1989, igniting a major political scandal {{as part of the}} larger Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H. Keating, Jr., Chairman of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> of a regulatory investigation by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people to know that Hiroshima <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
