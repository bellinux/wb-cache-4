This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{penetration}} into materials makes californium {{useful in}} detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners; neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. Neutron moisture gauges use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for {{gold and silver}} prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground <b>water</b> <b>movement.</b> The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.|$|E
50|$|Hydrodynamic {{reception}} {{refers to}} the ability of some animals to sense <b>water</b> <b>movements</b> generated by biotic (conspecifics, predators, or prey) or abiotic sources. This form of mechanoreception is useful for orientation, hunting, predator avoidance, and schooling. Frequent encounters with conditions of low visibility can prevent vision from being a reliable information source for navigation and sensing objects or organisms in the environment. Sensing <b>water</b> <b>movements</b> is one resolution to this problem.|$|R

5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
5|$|Corals are sessile {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> being significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of each coral colony depends {{not only on}} the species, but also on its location, depth, the amount of <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme <b>water</b> <b>movement,</b> where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>movement</b> {{can also}} be {{important}} in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift , depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. <b>Water</b> <b>movement</b> can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} ecohydrology is {{concerned}} with the interaction between ecosystems and water cycling, from measuring the small scale drainage of water into soil to tracking the broad movements of water evaporating off from trees. Because deuterium acts as a conservative tracer, it works well for tracking <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> through plants and ecosystems. Although <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> in single-process phenomena such as evaporation is relatively simple to track, many systems (e.g. cloud forests) in the environment have multiple sources and tracking <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> becomes more complicated. Isotope spiking can also be done to determine water transport through soil and into plants via injection of deuterated water directly into the ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Water {{management}} plays {{a significant}} role in enhancing performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Successful water management requires effective removal of liquid water produced by electrochemical reactions. Therefore, it is a critical challenge to understand liquid <b>water</b> <b>movements</b> in flow channels. In the present study, a three-dimensional unsteady two-phase model for the cathode side of PEMFC consisting of gas channel (GC), gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer (CL) is developed using FLUENT software with a volume-of-fluid (VOF) method and user-defined-function (UDF). When fuel cells are assembled, the cross sections of gas channel change, resulting in different <b>water</b> droplet <b>movements.</b> The effects of GDL deformations on <b>water</b> droplet <b>movements</b> are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Ocean {{currents}} can {{transport water}} {{over thousands of}} kilometres, and may bring water with different temperature and salinity into a region.

25|$|On the seabed, wrecks {{are slowly}} broken {{up by the}} forces of wave action caused by the weather and {{currents}} caused by tides. Also more highly oxygenated water, which promotes corrosion, reduces the strength of ferrous structural materials of the ship. Deeper wrecks are likely to be protected by less exposure to <b>water</b> <b>movement</b> and by lower levels of oxygen in water.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} cell types of sponges are the goblet-shaped cells called choanocytes, so named for their {{similarity}} to choanoflagellates.

To test whether cuttlefish show behavioural responses to local <b>water</b> <b>movements,</b> juvenile Sepia officinalis were exposed to local sinusoidal <b>water</b> <b>movements</b> of different frequencies (0. 01 – 1000 [*]Hz) produced by a vibrating sphere. Five behavioural responses were recorded: body pattern changing, moving, burrowing, orienting, and swimming. Cuttlefish responded to a wide range of frequencies (20 – 600 [*]Hz), but not to all of the frequencies tested within that range. No habituation to repeated stimuli was seen. Results indicate that cuttlefish can detect local <b>water</b> <b>movements</b> (most likely with the epidermal head and arm lines) and are able to integrate that information into behavioural responses...|$|R

25|$|The Earth tide {{encompasses}} {{the entire body}} of the Earth and is unhindered by the thin crust and land masses of the surface, on scales that make the rigidity of rock irrelevant.
