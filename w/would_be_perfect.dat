Dimitri eagerly accepted. Later, Brooke re-introduced Dimitri to J.R. Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous {{of the fact that}} Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Malcolm Reid {{proposed}} the station's site {{as a possible}} location for a £80 million Siemens wind turbine factory. The factory would create 700 jobs and up to 1,500 further jobs in the supply chain if built. He has said the site <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for the factory because of its close proximity to NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities. The factory {{is likely to be}} built either in Blyth or on Humberside.|$|E
5|$|Kevin McNally {{was cast}} as the {{antagonist}} Robert Osbourne; McNally was chosen because the producers thought he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> to play the part, {{as is the case}} with Debra Stephenson, who portrayed his wife. Child actor Daniel Chenery, who played the part of their son, Sammy, was chosen due to his likeness of a younger version of McNally. Also, Simon Crawford Collins's wife made a cameo appearance as a BT operator.|$|E
50|$|The E♭ {{clarinet}} {{established a}} niche {{for itself in}} the military band, particularly in Germany, from about 1805, whereas the bass clarinet <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected</b> by Adolphe Sax in 1838. Therefore, the defining moment {{with regard to the}} foundation of the full clarinet choir was the advent of Fontaine-Besson's successful clarinet-pedale design, exhibited in Paris in 1889 and patented in 1891.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first order}} announcing {{appointments}} in the regiment was dated 5 March 1833, {{and gave the}} names of the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, four captains and four lieutenants, stating that the organization of the regiment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected</b> by the selection of officers from the [...] "Battalion of Mounted Rangers."In June 1834, the regiment filled its complement of officers, many of whom later became noted Civil War generals: ...|$|R
5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for the film.|$|E

Next, they caught a ray of cheer: since they had something definite to go upon, now, they could probably borrow money on the reward--enough, at any rate, to tide them over till they got it; and meantime the materializing recipe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected,</b> and then good bye to trouble for good and all.|$|R

5|$|At a party {{hosted by}} her mother, Lansbury met John van Druten, who had {{recently}} co-authored a script for Gaslight (1944), a mystery-thriller based on Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play, Gas Light. Set in Victorian London, the film was being directed by George Cukor, and starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> {{for the role of}} Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with MGM, earning $500 a week and using her real name as her professional name. Upon release, Gaslight received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Supporting Actress for Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{reviewer}} for Next Generation commented, [...] "One {{minute the}} game believes it's a graphic adventure, the next it's a movie, {{and the next}} it's a puzzle game. If {{any one of these}} aspects <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected,</b> it could <b>be</b> a gamer's delight. As it stands, the game is mediocre in each category." [...] He specifically criticized that the characters [...] "are so overdone it's just plain funny" [...] and the first-person sequences can't be bypassed, forcing the player to watch the same graphics every time they backtrack.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} music career took off, began {{receiving}} offers for acting roles. He turned down every request until 1994, {{when he was}} offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received {{an increasing number of}} calls from directors who thought he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.|$|E

25|$|Falk {{continued}} searching {{and found}} Adelboden, which she felt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect.</b> The contracts {{to buy the}} desired land from three different farmers were signed in December 1930. In June 1931, Storrow and the World Committee of WAGGGS came to inspect the site, which they approved. The name Our Chalet was chosen so that every Girl Guide or Scout would feel it was her home.|$|E

However, this was transmitted using induction rather than radio signals, and although Stubblefield predicted that his system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected</b> so that [...] "it {{will be possible}} to communicate with hundreds of homes at the same time", and [...] "a single message can be sent from a central station to all parts of the United States", he was unable to overcome the inherent distance limitations of this technology.|$|R

25|$|After the {{financial}} failure of Paris Belongs to Us, Rivette unsuccessfully pitched a film adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel La Religieuse to producer Georges de Beauregard. Undaunted, Rivette and co-writer Gruault began writing the script; in 1962, Rivette suggested that Godard's wife, Anna Karina, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> {{in the lead}} role. Godard agreed, but de Beauregard and producer Eric Schulmberger rejected the idea after a Commission de Controle (the French censorship board) review {{said that it would}} be banned.|$|E
25|$|After briefly {{considering}} Sterling Hayden for Gashade, Hellman was {{shopping in}} a Los Angeles bookstore when he suddenly and simultaneously thought of Perkins, Warren Oates, and Will Hutchins {{for the main}} roles. Perkins was Hellman's next door neighbor at the time, and she had known both Hellman and Nicholson for many years, having first met them while {{all of them were}} attending the same acting class. Hellman immediately telephoned Nicholson with his casting idea. Nicholson agreed that the three actors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Father Crespí had {{identified}} a location along the Los Angeles River that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for a settlement, possibly a mission, but in 1781, King Charles III of Spain ordered that a pueblo {{be built on}} the site, {{which would be the}} second town in Alta California after San José de Guadalupe, founded in 1777. By royal edict, all of the waters of the river and its tributaries were reserved for the Pueblo de Los Angeles, a condition which would have a profound impact on development of the Valley.|$|E
50|$|The third type of knuckle curve {{was thrown}} by Dave Stenhouse in the 1960s. Stenhouse's knuckle curve was thrown like a fastball {{but with a}} knuckleball grip. Stenhouse {{discovered}} that this pitch had excellent movement, {{and when he came}} to the majors, he utilized it as a breaking pitch. This pitch may have been the same as the knuckleball thrown by Jesse Haines and Freddie Fitzsimmons. The pitch <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfected</b> by Chicago White Sox legend Hoyt Wilhelm during the later stages of his career, after flirting with it for most of his time in the majors.|$|R

25|$|Several causes were identified: {{the late}} {{completion}} of the design made preparing training materials difficult, subcontractors did not always {{provide detailed information on}} the operation of their equipment, the combat system training was based on the completed version of the software and not the partial system installed in Collins, and the training assumed that none of the systems would break down. The last problem was part of an overall attitude that the first boat <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> off the production line and that no breakdowns would occur, and as a result, early equipment manuals tended to be light on content, and Collins would be sent to sea with few spare parts.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{years later}} Double Indemnity was {{included}} {{in a collection of}} Cain's works entitled Three of a Kind. Paramount executive Joseph Sistrom thought the material <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> for Wilder and they bought the rights for $15,000. Paramount resubmitted the script to the Hays Office, but the response was nearly identical to the one eight years earlier. Wilder, Paramount executive William Dozier, and Sistrom decided to move forward anyway. They submitted a film treatment crafted by Wilder and his writing partner Charles Brackett, and this time the Hays Office approved the project with only a few objections: the portrayal of the disposal of the body, a proposed gas-chamber execution scene, and the skimpiness of the towel worn by the female lead in her first scene.|$|E
25|$|In December, Canadian-born Sydney Newman {{arrived at}} BBC Television {{as the new}} Head of Drama. Newman was a science fiction fan who had overseen several such {{productions}} in his previous positions at ABC Television and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In March 1963, he was made aware by Baverstock – now promoted to Controller of Programmes – of {{a gap in the}} schedule on Saturday evenings between the sports showcase Grandstand and the pop music programme Juke Box Jury. Ideally, any programme scheduled here would appeal to children that had previously been accustomed to the timeslot; the teenaged audience of Juke Box Jury; and the adult sports fan audience of Grandstand. Newman decided that a science fiction programme <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>perfect</b> to fill the gap, and enthusiastically took up the existing Script Department research, initiating several brainstorming sessions with Wilson, Braybon, Frick and another BBC staff writer, C. E. 'Bunny' Webber.|$|E

25|$|Outside of {{his work}} on his cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Cosby was doing little in film or television, but Carsey and Werner were fans of Cosby's {{stand-up}} comedy and thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the <b>perfect</b> material for a family sitcom.|$|R
