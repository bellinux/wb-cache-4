60|$|The {{suspense}} was terrible. Sam'l and Sanders {{had both}} {{known all along}} that Bell would take {{the first of the}} two who asked her. Even those who thought her proud admitted that she was modest. Bitterly the weaver repented having waited so long. Now it was too late. In ten minutes Sanders would be at T'nowhead; in an hour all would be over. Sam'l rose to his feet in a daze. His mother pulled him down by the coat-tail, and his father shook him, thinking he was walking in his sleep. He tottered past them, however, hurried up the aisle, which was so narrow that Dan'l Ross could only reach his seat by <b>walking</b> <b>sideways,</b> and was gone before the minister could do more than stop {{in the middle of a}} whirl and gape in horror after him.|$|E
60|$|I {{should not}} like to say for certain that horses {{have a sense of}} humour, but I {{sometimes}} think they must. I had a horse years ago who used to take delight in teasing girls. I can describe it no other way. He would pick out a girl {{a quarter of a mile}} off; always some haughty, well-dressed girl who was feeling pleased with herself. As we approached he would eye her with horror and astonishment. It was too marked to escape notice. A hundred yards off he would be <b>walking</b> <b>sideways,</b> backing away from her; I would see the poor lady growing scarlet with the insult and annoyance of it. Opposite to her, he would shy the entire width of the road, and make pretence to bolt. Looking back I would see her vainly appealing to surrounding nature for a looking-glass to see what it was that had gone wrong with her.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Despite {{decades of}} work on the neuromuscular {{physiology}} of crustacean leg muscles, {{little is known about}} how physiological differences between these muscles relate to their behavioral usage. We studied a <b>sideways</b> <b>walking</b> shore crab, Carcinus maenas, and a forward walking spider crab, Libinia emarginata, as part of our work to understand the neural control of locomotion. The two species differed significantly in facilitation at neuro-muscular junctions for every muscle studied. Further, these differences are correlated exactly with the walking use of the muscles. The forward walking spider crab showed more facilitation in muscles which operate joints having larger ranges of motion in forward walking. Likewise, greater facilitation was seen in muscles more active during side-ways walking in the predominantly <b>sideways</b> <b>walking</b> shore crab. These differences even occur between muscles innervated by the same motor neuron, and become more evident with higher stimulus frequency. The increased presynaptic facilitation might allow selective recruitment of fibers innervated by the same motor neuron and aid in temporal filtering...|$|R
25|$|The bridge's {{movements}} {{were caused by}} a 'positive feedback' phenomenon, known as synchronous lateral excitation. The natural sway motion of people <b>walking</b> caused small <b>sideways</b> oscillations in the bridge, which in turn caused people on the bridge to sway in step, increasing the amplitude of the bridge oscillations and continually reinforcing the effect. On the day of opening, the bridge was crossed by 90,000 people, with up to 2,000 on the bridge at any one time.|$|R
60|$|Every morning Mr Clinton {{left his}} house in Camberwell {{in time to catch}} the eight-fifty-five train for the city. He made his way up Ludgate Hill, <b>walking</b> <b>sideways,</b> with a {{projection}} of the left part of his body, a habit he had acquired from constantly slipping past and between people who walked less rapidly than himself. Such persons always annoyed him; if they were not in a hurry he was, and they had no right to obstruct the way; and it was improper for a city man to loiter in the morning--the luncheon-hour was the time for loitering, no one was then in haste; but in the morning and at night {{on the way back to}} the station, one ought to walk at the same pace as everybody else. If Mr Clinton had been head of a firm, he would never have had in his office a man who sauntered in the morning. If a man wanted to loiter, let him go to the West-end; there he could lounge about all day. But the city was meant for business, and there wasn't time for West-end airs in the city.|$|E
6000|$|Devout-under-difficulties {{would have}} been the name of Lang Tammas had he been of Covenanting times. So I thought one wintry afternoon, years before I went to the schoolhouse, when he dropped in to ask the {{pleasure}} of my company to the farmer of Little Rathie's [...] "bural." [...] As a good Auld Licht, Tammas reserved his swallow-tail coat and [...] "lum hat" [...] (chimney pot) for the kirk and funerals; but the coat would have flapped villainously, to Tammas's eternal ignominy, had he for one rash moment relaxed his hold on the bottom button, and it was only by <b>walking</b> <b>sideways,</b> as horses sometimes try to do, that the hat could be kept at the angle of decorum. Let it not be thought that Tammas had asked me to Little Rathie's funeral on his own responsibility. Burals were among the few events to break the monotony of an Auld Licht winter, and invitations were as much sought after as cards to my lady's dances in the south. This had been a fair average season for Tammas, though of his four burials one had been a bairn's--a mere bagatelle; but {{had it not been for}} the death of Little Rathie I would probably not have been out that year at all.|$|E
50|$|Swords of Xeen {{exploits}} some quirks of {{the engine}} to great effect, such as morphing monsters by using the regular animation of one monster and the attack animation of another. The game also contains bugs in scripting, which allow the player to bypass many encounters by <b>walking</b> <b>sideways.</b>|$|E
40|$|Five interneurones in each {{connective}} respond directionally to {{rotation of}} a crab. Each {{seems to be}} activated by one direction of fluid flow in one statocyst canal. The anatomy of two is known and correlates well with a direct input from the receptors of one statocyst. Three of the fibres have input from leg joint proprioceptors. The swimming reflex and a complicated turning reflex are evoked on rotation of a minimally restrained crab. It {{is likely that the}} statocyst inter-neurones are involved in these and other behaviour patterns, including the rearing reflex and <b>sideways</b> <b>walking...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{technique}} used by Francois Rabbath is the Crab Technique, {{named for the}} way the handmovement resembles a crab's <b>sideways</b> <b>walking.</b> The technique is outlined in the third volume of the Rabbath Method and allows {{for part of the}} hand to move while the other part remains and vice versa - in this way the hand can move up and down the string in certain passages without ever fully shifting. Rabbath is not the first person to use the Crab Technique but he is the first double bassist to name it and give it a thorough full technical exploration.|$|R
5000|$|Lines or {{pieces of}} paper on the floorStepping over {{a piece of paper}} on the floor or having lines visible on the ground can often be very {{effective}} and is very cheap method. contrast is extremely important in this method: if the floor is dark, then white paper or lines are most effective and if the floor is light colored, then dark paper or lines are most effective. For lines to be most beneficial they must be transverse in the direction of <b>walking.</b> zig-zag or <b>sideways</b> lines have been shown to not be nearly as effective. A simple computer piece of paper has been shown to work, {{but in the case of}} lines often something only one to two inches in width is helpful in improving the mobility through kinesia paradoxa.|$|R
50|$|Bergen's {{condition}} worsened in 1899, {{which led}} to internal turmoil for the Beaneaters. He was having hallucinations that enemies were trying to poison him. His son died in April, and Bergen imagined that his teammates were making jokes behind his back about the death. He began sitting in particular positions, and <b>walking</b> <b>sideways,</b> {{so that he could}} spot assassins approaching from either side of him. Boston's team president urged the other players to avoid Bergen, fearing what he might do. Some blamed his condition on heavy drink, but Bergen was regarded by others as a teetotaler.|$|E

50|$|Bernard Dodge {{spent the}} first 20 {{years of his life}} working on the family farm. He {{recalled}} to biographer W. J. Robbins that at the age of 10 a bumper crop of sorghum required operation of the mill day and night during the rush period of syrup making. At such times Dodge's father, two of Dodge's older brothers, and Dodge worked 18 hours a day, beginning at midnight. (Dodge's job was to stand on the circling horsepower platform and drive the horses, <b>walking</b> <b>sideways</b> to avoid dizziness.) That same winter, Bernard Dodge also worked at the local schoolhouse, one mile away, to sweep out the schoolhouse and build the fire. He earned five cents each school day.|$|E
40|$|Our trunks {{influence}} {{where we}} perform actions in space. Thus, trunk direction may define {{a region of}} space that is accorded special treatment by the attention system. We investigated conditions under which a trunk orientation bias for attention might be relevant for healthy adults. Three experiments compared visual detection performance for participants standing and walking on a treadmill. Together, the experiments disambiguate the relative contributions of motor activity, motor load, and cognitive load on trunk orientation biases. In Experiment 1, trunk orientation biases (i. e., faster target detection for targets {{in front of the}} body midline) were observed in both forward and <b>sideways</b> <b>walking</b> conditions, but not in standing conditions. In Experiment 2, we ruled out the notion that the trunk orientation bias arose from increased motor activity; in fact, the bias was greatest when participants walked at an unusually slow pace. In Experiment 3, we directly compared motor load with cognitive load in a dual-task paradigm; cognitive load influenced overall performance speed, but only motor load produced trunk orientation bias. These results suggest that a trunk orientation bias emerges during walking and motor load conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} further {{progress in}} the design of a low mass, biologically inspired nanorover suitable for Mars surface exploration and sample return missions. An advanced legged vehicle is presented, incorporating a hybrid DC motor and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuation system to minimise mass and conserve power. Previous work demonstrated that an ultra low mass vehicle could be designed using composite materials. Innovations in this new design include hybrid lightweight DC motor / SMA technology for high power / mass ratio whilst minimising power use, and steps to achieve proportional control of both DC motors and SMA actuators, although work on this area continues in order to resolve problems with proportional control of SMA. Agility is improved using legs with increased angular displacement, which facilitates attitude control over steep and uneven landscapes and enables implementation of biologically- inspired locomotion techniques such as crawling and <b>sideways</b> <b>walking,</b> and adding a third degree of freedom which allows the rover to display an extensive array of gait and pose options. System control applies embedded systems technology running a Linux operating system, force sensors are installed on each leg to provide feedback of terrain interaction for gait management purposes, and power storage capacity and efficiency are improved, enabling the vehicle to carry sufficient power reserves for meaningful excursion durations. The vehicle incorporates an innovative lightweight sample collection arm which uses two servo motors and two SMA actuators. This allows it to collect approximately 2 cm 3 of sample. Mass is minimised by using a combination of aluminium and Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). Total system mass is less than 1 kg, offering the opportunity for a swarm of rovers to form part of the overall Mars mission. These vehicles would take advantage of their superior agility and ability to traverse difficult landscapes and complement the operation of a larger wheeled mother rover - the mother vehicle would carry larger scale science and navigation equipment, as well as on board power resources, whereas the smaller vehicle can be dispatched to climb through rocky and steep terrain or deep into fissures to retrieve samples from the most interesting locations, returning to the mother rover for power and to deposit the sample...|$|R
5000|$|The Wii game is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels between [...] "galaxies" [...] to collect Power Stars, earned by {{completing}} quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of planets and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's new physics system gives each celestial object its own gravitational force, which lets the player completely circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by <b>walking</b> <b>sideways</b> or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and then fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in 3D, there are several points in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear, {{and many of these}} return in its sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2.|$|E
5000|$|The {{speed of}} motor {{development}} is rapid in early life, {{as many of}} the reflexes of the newborn alter or disappear within the first year, and slows later. Like physical growth, motor development shows predictable patterns of cephalocaudal (head to foot) and proximodistal (torso to extremities) development, with movements at the head and in the more central areas coming under control before those of {{the lower part of the}} body or the hands and feet. Types of movement develop in stage-like sequences; for example, locomotion at 6-8 months involves creeping on all fours, then proceeds to pulling to stand, [...] "cruising" [...] while holding on to an object, walking while holding an adult's hand, and finally walking independently. Older children continue the sequence by <b>walking</b> <b>sideways</b> or backward, galloping, hopping, skipping with one foot and walking with the other, and finally skipping. By middle childhood and adolescence, new motor skills are acquired by instruction or observation rather than in a predictable sequence. There are executive functions of the brain (working memory, timing measure of inhibition and switching) which are important to motor skills. Critiques to the order of Executive Functioning leads to Motor Skills, suggesting Motor Skills can support Executive Functioning in the brain.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPedestrian {{stepping}} behaviour {{has been}} widely ignored in crowd simulation models. Yet, the continuous motion of pedestrian torsos {{is the result of}} decisions about discrete steps. In this contribution we discuss biomechanical pedestrian stepping behaviour and present arguments that show its importance. In addition, we analyse empirical data from controlled experiments to better understand how pedestrians make their steps. The results show the dependence of step length on speed in different walking situations, like <b>walking</b> <b>sideways</b> or climbing stairs. Independently of whether subjects walked ahead, sideways or backwards in the plane, increasing speed goes along with increasing step lengths...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the motion}} {{characteristics}} of double-half-revolution mechanism, a new-style wheel-legged lunar rover was proposed. In order to evaluate its maneuvering performance, the performance experiment of single wheellegged mechanism is needed. To simulate the loading conditions of single wheel-legged mechanism when the lunar rover is walking in flat ground, climbing up a slope or <b>walking</b> <b>sideways</b> in a slope, this paper analyzed their statics under the above three conditions, {{and set up}} their force models respectively. Using MATLAB software, the pressure loads which applied on each wheel-legged mechanism under the above three conditions are simulated, and their curves are given. The results provide a loading reference for the performance experiment of single wheel-legged mechanism.  National Technical University of Ukraine "KPI"; Ternopil National Economic University; Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology; Hubei University of Technolog...|$|E
