40|$|When neural {{networks}} {{are used for}} approximating action-values of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, the “inter-ference ” caused by incremental learning can be serious. To solve this problem, in this paper, a neural network model with incremental learning ability was applied to RL prob-lems. In this model, correctly acquired input-output rela-tions are stored into long-term memory, and the memorized data are effectively recalled in order to suppress the interfer-ence. In order to evaluate the incremental learning ability, the proposed model was applied to two problems: Extended Random-Walk Task and Extended Mountain-Car Task. In these tasks, the working space of agents is extended as the learning proceeds. In the simulations, <b>we</b> <b>certified</b> <b>that</b> the proposed model could acquire proper action-values as com-pared with the following three approaches to the approxima-tion of action-value functions: tile coding, a conventional neural network model and the previously proposed neural network model. 1...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} that {{reverberation}} degrades speech intelligibility is the effect of overlap-masking, in which segments of an acoustic signal are affected by reverberation components of previous segments [Bolt et al., 1949]. To reduce the overlap-masking, Arai et al. suppressed steady-state portions having more energy, but which are less crucial for speech perception, and confirmed promising results for improving speech intelligibility [Arai et al., 2002]. Our goal is to provide a pre-processing filter? for each auditorium. To explore the relationship between the effect of a pre-processing filter and reverberation conditions, we conducted a perceptual test with steady-state suppression under various reverberation conditions. The results showed that processed stimuli performed better than unprocessed ones and clear improvements were observed for reverberation conditions of 0. 8 - 1. 0 s. <b>We</b> <b>certified</b> <b>that</b> steady-state suppression was an effective pre-processing method for improving speech intelligibility under reverberant conditions and proved the effect of overlap-masking. 1...|$|R

40|$|Many {{organizations}} specify information release {{policies to}} describe the terms under which sensitive information may be released to other organizations. This paper presents a new approach for ensuring that security-critical software correctly enforces its information release policy. Our approach has two parts. First, an information release policy is specified as a security automaton written in a new language called AIR. Second, we enforce an AIR policy by translating it into an API for programs written in λAIR, a core formalism for a functional programming language. λAIR uses a novel combination of dependent, affine, and singleton types {{to ensure that the}} API is used correctly. As a consequence <b>we</b> can <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> programs written in λAIR meet the requirements of the original AIR policy specification. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. From its {{creation}} in 1989 through subsequent extensions, the widely-used “SnapPea census ” now aims to represent all cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3 -manifolds {{that can be}} obtained from ≤ 8 ideal tetrahedra. Its construction, however, has relied on inexact computations and some unproven (though reasonable) assumptions, and so its completeness was never guaran-teed. For the first time, we prove here that the census meets its aim: <b>we</b> rigor-ously <b>certify</b> <b>that</b> every ideal 3 -manifold triangulation with ≤ 8 tetrahedra is either (i) homeomorphic to one of the census manifolds, or (ii) non-hyperbolic. In addition, we extend the census to 9 tetrahedra, and likewise prove this to be complete. We also present the first list of all minimal triangulations of all census manifolds, including non-geometric as well as geometric triangulations. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{congenital}} {{lacrimal sac}} fistula is a lacrimal duct dys-plasia in which epithelium from the lacrimal sac or the lacrimal duct {{is connected to}} the skin [1]. In most cases, the lesions are unilateral and located at the inferolateral to medial canthus. Most cases are asymptomatic and do not progress. Therefore most fistulas are incidentally discov-ered during routine clinical examinations [2]. The authors now report an atypical case of congenital lacrimal sac fis-tula located on the temporal side of the lateral canthus. Case Report A systemically healthy 1 -year-old girl came to the out-patient clinic with a complaint of tearing on the temporal side of the right lateral canthus since birth (Fig. 1). Water-ing increased on weeping or blinking. On examination, a small orifice was found in the skin at the temporal side of the lateral canthus. There was no evidence of inflamma-tion or swelling around the opening. An operation was car-ried out under general anesthesia. In the saline syringing test, saline drained through the lateral lacrimal sac fistula. <b>We</b> <b>certified</b> <b>that</b> the fistula was connected to the lacrimal drainage system by probing the orifice of the fistula and finding that the probe ran straight {{in the direction of the}} lacrimal sac (Fig. 2 A). The skin was incised and a fistu-lectomy was performed 2 cm away from the orifice. The lower lid stretched as the dissected fistula was pulled (Fig. 2 B and 2 C). The remnant tract was closed with 6 - 0 vicryl and cauterization using a monopolar device. The skin was closed with 6 - 0 plain catgut.

40|$|Purpose: The {{green tea}} {{polyphenol}} (GTPP) {{has been known}} to exert antioxidant activity as a radical scavenger as well as cancer preventive and cancer growth inhibition effect. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify whether GTPP not only potentiate the growth inhibition effect in γ-irradiated human cancer cell but also exert protection action for irradiated human normal cell. Materials and Methods: GTPP (80 % catechin including> 45 % EGCG) added in the HL 60, human leukemia, and NC 37, human lymphoblast, before irradiation. After establishing the amount of GTPP and the dose of radiation, the cells were treated with the GTPP for 6 hours and irradiated with the determined doses. Results: Viability when 10 ㎍/ ㎖ GTPP added before γ-irradiation with 1 Gy to NC 37 cells was not different in comparison with control but it when was irradiated with 3 Gy significantly different (1 Gy;P= 0. 126, 3 Gy;P= 0. 010). 20 ㎍/ ㎖ GTPP did not show significant difference in both NC 37 cells irradiated with 1 Gy and 3 Gy (1 Gy;P= 0. 946, 3 Gy;P= 0. 096). Viabilities were significantly decreased with concentration of additional GTPP in HL 60 with 1 or 3 Gy (1 Gy; 69. 0 ± 1. 7 % vs 42. 4 ± 1. 3 %, 3 Gy; 66. 9 ± 3. 9 % vs 44. 2 ± 1. 6 %). Conclusion: In vitro study, <b>we</b> <b>certified</b> <b>that</b> when the cells were irradiated with dose below 3 Gy, GTPP provide not only anticancerous effect against cancer cells but also radioprotective effect in normal cells simultaneously.

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, we reported the optimum operation scheduling method for the pumping-up power stations disregarding of transmission loss. In this paper, we report the optimum operation scheduling method {{in case of}} transmission loss involving. When transmission loss is ignored, we can determine that the priority of the pumping-up power stations {{is equal to the}} total efficiency order. However, when transmission loss is involved, we must determine the optimum operation taking into account the incremental transmission loss. To be easy for calculation, we make some assumptions in this paper. With these assumptions and incremental transmission loss, we calculate the incremental fuel cost of electric power system in totality. And we report the optimum operation scheduling method using this total incremental fuel cost.
