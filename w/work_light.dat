500|$|They {{are used}} today in {{agricultural}} <b>work,</b> <b>light</b> draft and {{the sport of}} combined driving. The popularity of driving sport in Hungary rose sharply during the 1970s and 1980s. The Combined Driving World Championships are held every 2 years, and the most competitive event features teams of four horses. Of the 6 champions named between 1974 and 1984, all but one were Hungarian. The Nonius is slower and less suitable for other riding sports like dressage and show jumping than lighter horses. Smaller members of the breed with larger amounts of Arabian blood in their ancestry are more sought after as riding horses. The heavier horses are still commonly used for draft work, and are well-adapted to the [...] "heavy terrain" [...] of the Great Hungarian Plain.|$|E
500|$|Today {{the breed}} {{is used in}} many {{activities}} that include draft and pack <b>work,</b> <b>light</b> harness and combined driving, and many under-saddle events, including western-style horse-show classes, trail and endurance riding, dressage, show jumping, vaulting, and therapeutic riding programs. [...] They are used extensively as dressage horses for children, but are tall and sturdy enough to be suitable riding horses for adults. In the 1970s, British Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh competed with a driving team of four Haflingers. [...] There are several national shows for Haflingers worldwide, including those in Germany, Great Britain and the United States. Despite the Austrian prohibitions against crossbreeding, other countries have practiced this to some extent. Good quality animals have been produced out of crosses between Haflingers and both Arabians and Andalusians. British enthusiasts maintain a partbred registry for Haflinger crosses. In Germany, horses that are 75 percent Haflinger and 25 percent Arabian are popular and are called Arabo-Haflingers. In Italy, where horse meat consumption is at the highest among all European Community members, Haflingers provide {{a large percentage of}} national production. Most are either bred specifically for meat production and slaughtered between the ages of 10 and 18 months, or as a result of health problems, or age. The Haflinger also produces the majority of the horse milk consumed in Germany.|$|E

2500|$|After the STS-125 mission, a <b>work</b> <b>light</b> knob was {{discovered}} jammed {{in the space}} between one of Atlantiss front interior windows and the Orbiter dashboard structure. The knob was believed to have entered the space during flight, when the pressurized Orbiter was expanded to its maximum size. Then, once back on Earth, the Orbiter contracted, jamming the knob in place. Leaving [...] "as-is" [...] was considered unsafe for flight, and some options for removal (including window replacement) would have included a 6-month delay of Atlantiss next mission (planned to be STS-129). Had the removal of the knob been unsuccessful, the worst-case scenario was that Atlantis could have been retired from the fleet, leaving Discovery and Endeavour to complete the manifest alone. On 29 June 2009, Atlantis was pressurized to [...] (3 psi above ambient), which forced the Orbiter to expand slightly. The knob was then frozen with dry ice, and successfully removed. [...] Small areas of damage to the window were discovered where the edges of the knob had been embedded into the pane. [...] Subsequent investigation of the window damage discovered a maximum defect depth of approximately , less than the reportable depth threshold of [...] and not serious enough to warrant the pane’s replacement.|$|E
