The dark reference image was first subtracted from both the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> and the actual measurement at each wavelength in order to correct for thermal dark current [6]. Next, the resulting data set was divided by the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> in order to correct for illumination and gain variations across the detector and to obtain the reflectance.

For this purpose, three different theoretical models were tested and will be discussed in a later section.|$|E

Dark field reflection intensity at 400 – 800 nm (reflection spectrum) of the samples on Al-foils was obtained with a duplicate accumulation of signals at an exposure time of 1 s with an unexposed interval of 1 s.

30|$|The {{calibration}} procedure and {{methods have been}} fully tested in hyperspectral data collection from natural scenes [8]. The brightly colored side of each butterfly wing sample was mounted vertically in a panel containing a black hole of 3 - or 1 -cm diameter. The hole ensured a proper black background {{within the field of}} view of the scene. Hyperspectral data were calibrated using a white and a black reference image. The <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> image was obtained from a white diffuser (Edmund Optics opal diffuser 50 mm). The white diffuser minimized the effect of non-homogeneous spatial distribution of intensity in the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> image. This issue will be analyzed later. The white diffuser was not a perfect diffuser and, therefore, its reflectance factor was calibrated against BaSO 4 using a spectrophotometer with integrating sphere (Shimadzu UV- 310 -PC). The black reference image provided an estimation of the dark current noise of the CCD camera and was obtained in the dark room with the sample holder empty, with the same exposure times as in the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> image and with the light source off. The reflectance factor [2] was therefore calculated using the standard two-point correction [4, 5]. The wavelength range between 400 and 718 nm was sampled at 6 -nm intervals. Each hyperspectral set consisted of 54 images. The wings of two butterfly species were examined: Morpho didius (Nymphalidae) and Papilio palinurus (Papilionidae) [1, 9, 10]. The colorimetric methods employed in this study are standard for the representation of structural colors and are available elsewhere [2, 7].|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{lessons learned}} from the 2009 and 2010 joint field campaigns to Tuz Golu, Turkey. Emphasis is placed on the 2010 campaign related to understanding the equipment and measurement protocols, processing schemes, and traceability to SI quantities. Participants in both 2009 and 2010 used an array of measurement approaches to determine surface reflectance. One lesson learned is that even with all of the differences in collection between groups, the differences in reflectance are currently dominated by instrumental artifacts including knowledge of the <b>white</b> <b>reference.</b> Processing methodology plays a limited role once the bi-directional reflectance of the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> is used rather than a hemispheric-directional value. The lack of a basic set of measurement protocols, or best practices, limits a group s ability to ensure SI traceability and the development of proper error budgets. Finally, rigorous attention to sampling methodology and its impact on instrument behavior is needed. The results of the 2009 and 2010 joint campaigns clearly demonstrate both the need and utility of such campaigns and such comparisons must continue in the future to ensure a coherent set of data that can span multiple sensor types and multiple decades...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} intelligent vision system that absorbs useful information from its environment and draws useful conclusions. This system {{can give the}} instructions to locate vacant seats that are currently occupying in a cinema theater. Extraction of useful information without viewing or exposing inside details of an environment through an active vision system is proposed. Reasoning based conclusions are drawn for optimum searching. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using an experiment. Three reasoning criteria are developed and experimentally tested for identifying the states of seats, States of seat can be vacant state, occupied state, or a state with an object placed on the seat. First criterion basically uses binary image analysis and {{with the introduction of}} <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> value it can also be applied for environments where there are intermittent variations of illumination level. Second criterion is based on the analysis of color image and it can be basically used for identifying objects placed on seats. Third criterion based on the analysis of intensity image. Intelligent vision system was developed using the combination of first and second criteria. The created graphical user interface provides links for setting up the system, and setup program i provides an interface and instructions for user to find seat locations and entering those locations in the main program and other setup programs. Setup program 2 is given for automatically calculating the other necessary parameters and <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> program for setting up <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> values. The intelligent vision system can be further developed and generalized for other applications. Mainly it can be used for intelligent building applications. For example in designing an intelligent room where the movements and changes occurring inside the room could be monitored using a camera system. In a multi storey building, required information of a particular floor that is used for common seating could be displayed at other floors. In a vehicle park, the registration number and the entering time of the vehicles could be recorded. Available parking spaces can be displayed at the entrance...|$|E

30|$|Naim and Isa (2012) {{proposed}} a method called pixel distribution shifting color correction (PDSCC) for digital color image {{to correct the}} <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> point and ensure that the <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> point is achromatic. PDSCC extends the method of 3 D rotational matrix (3 DMAT) by implementing the modification on 2 D two-color channel plane. 3 DMAT is the first 3 D rotational method used due to its simplicity of usage and fast execution. 3 DMAT employs the 3 D pixel distribution rotational by rotating the pixels three times (yaw, pitch, and roll) using three different rotational angles. In the PDSCC, two 3 D rotational methods for color correction are specifically designed to shift the pixel distribution of an image such that the surrounding insignificant illumination will be suppressed or removed from the output image. This is done by moving the pixel distribution of the image to the diagonal plane of 3 D RGB color model. The shifting process is implemented on 2 D two-color channel plane instead of on 3 D RGB color model directly. These 2 D color planes are constructed from 3 D RGB color model, namely red-green plane, red-blue-plane, and green-blue plane. This process could ensure the surrounding illumination pixel distribution to be rendered achromatic. From the viewer side, the method corrects the image color to become more natural. The method also intervenes with the saturation problem of the image. However, it does not optimally increase the image contrast.|$|E
30|$|The {{black and}} <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> images {{are of the}} same size as the {{incoming}} video frames. Due to the significant amount of data, these images are stored in an external DRAM connected to the FPGA. Because both video streams are synchronized at the pixel level, external memory accesses can be structured to reduce the memory bandwidth requirements. To this end, the reference images for both cameras are stored in interleaved order, such that random accesses are avoided: one value for one pixel of each left and right black image and one value for each left and right white image can be read together in a single access cycle.|$|E

We measured the spectral sensitivity functions of the imaging system by using a Spectro-radiometer and a Monochromator. Spectral images calibration to compensate the undesirable effects due to uncontrolled acquisition conditions is done using a standard <b>white</b> <b>reference</b> and a black reference.
