5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's assistant, Bob de Moor, was {{responsible}} for making many of the alterations. De Moor {{was sent to the}} port at Antwerp to sketch a 1939 oil tanker that <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a basis for a ship that appears in the story, the Speedol Star.|$|E
5000|$|Since at {{this point}} in history most of the growth on the Internet was coming from non-military sources, it was decided that the Department of Defense would no longer fund {{registration}} services outside of the [...]mil TLD. In 1993 the U.S. National Science Foundation, after a competitive bidding process in 1992, created the InterNIC to manage the allocations of addresses and management of the address databases, and awarded the contract to three organizations. Registration Services <b>would</b> be <b>provided</b> by Network Solutions; Directory and Database Services <b>would</b> be <b>provided</b> by AT&T; and Information Services <b>would</b> be <b>provided</b> by General Atomics.|$|R

5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> {{a test for}} the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.|$|E

5|$|The {{field at}} Waterloo was 5.5km wide, with two {{parallel}} ridges running west to east, creating a shallow valley 1.4km across. On the allied right lay the chateau of Hougoumont, {{a collection of}} walled farm buildings lying closer to the French line than the Allies' line. Recognising its defensive importance, Wellington ordered Hanoverian and Nassau troops to occupy the farm. In allied hands, it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> cover for flanking fire against any French assault of the main allied line; in French hands, it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a bastion from which they could launch attacks. Since it defended the Nivelles road {{as well as the}} Allies' right flank, Wellington ordered that it was to be held at all costs.|$|E
5|$|The name Hale, {{which occurs}} {{throughout}} Britain, {{derives from the}} Anglo-Saxon halh meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area which has natural features that <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> shelter. The 'Barns' element of Hale Barns comes from the Old Tithe Barn.|$|E

5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, Hays faced {{opposition}} to {{his choice of}} Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because {{there was not much}} traffic there.

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E
5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E
