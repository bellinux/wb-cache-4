500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} four guest artists; Rakim {{from the}} hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim on [...] "Guilty All the Same", Page Hamilton from the American alternative metal band Helmet on [...] "All for Nothing", Daron Malakian from System of a Down for the song [...] "Rebellion" [...] and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine fame on the song [...] "Drawbar". Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him before. And I was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know? And if that's why the song says it's feeling like it should be, then why don't <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> straight to the source".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You and I both know they can’t {{go back to}} the other [...] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By me, dolly. So is this pie. Let's {{get some}} medium to levitate {{us up to}} bed. Uh--uh---- I think perhaps we'd better not try to drive clear to Seattle. If <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> through to Montana?--or even just to Bismarck?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Luckily, {{his girlfriend}} said, [...] "He's {{absolutely}} right. There aren't enough interesting videos on MTV, and {{that sounds like}} a brilliant idea." [...] Mark didn't say anything but he didn't make the call {{to get me out of}} Budapest. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> ahead and did it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{both been}} deceiving you," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr. Heard, loudly. [...] "I didn't {{jump into the}} harbor the other night, and I didn't tumble in, and Mr. Fred Dix didn't jump in after me; <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> {{to the end of}} the harbor and walked in and wetted ourselves." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We want, or wanted, {{to believe}} that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive {{and if there is}} no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on... there is no mercy killing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brad Neely {{provides}} the voices for Steve Smith, Frank Smith, and Mark [...] "Baby" [...] Cakes; Weidenfeld states that Neely does [...] "the heavy lifting with the voices ... every episode, he's probably at least 40% of the lines." [...] According to him, {{it allows for}} production to run more seamlessly: [...] "Rather than hav to wait for somebody else's schedule, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> next door and do it." [...] Neely also records temporary [...] "scratch" [...] lines for other actors to speed up production. Neely stated that in voicing [...] "a full episode's work of somebody, we start the day as an actor." [...] For voice-over work, the crew works on {{two or three hours}} of dialogue for a certain character, followed by storyboard meetings, dailies, and rough cuts, with Neely directing other actors who come in after him.|$|E
2500|$|Star Wars: The Clone Wars {{was made}} to serve as both a {{stand-alone}} story and a lead-in to the weekly [...] George Lucas had {{the idea for a}} film after viewing some of the completed footage of the early episodes on the big screen. Those first few episodes, originally planned for release on television, were then woven together to form the theatrical release. The story of the kidnapped Hutt was inspired by the Sonny Chiba samurai film titled Shogun’s Shadow. Warner Bros. had tracked the series' development from the beginning, and Lucas decided on a theatrical launch after viewing early footage declaring [...] "This is so beautiful, why don't <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> and use the crew and make a feature?" [...] Lucas described the film was [...] "almost an afterthought." [...] Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, said of the decision, [...] "Sometimes George works in strange ways." [...] Producer Catherine Winder said the sudden decision added to an already large challenge of establishing a show [...] "of this sophistication and complexity," [...] but she felt it was a good way to start the series, and thought budgetary constraints forced the production team to think outside the box in a positive way.|$|E
60|$|OLIVER. No. I'm {{glad you}} came. But I feel I can't KNOW anything. <b>We</b> must <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on.|$|R
5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really flattered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I've {{been told}} all that before, Mr. Slide; them things weren't given by no manner of means, as I look at it. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in and took 'em. It was hall a haccident {{whether it was}} Cobden or Peel, Gladstone or Disraeli, as was the {{servants}} we employed to do our work. But Liberal is Liberal, and Conservative is Conservative. What are you, Mr. Slide, to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{understand}} nothing, Major," [...] broke in Jeekie. [...] "Don't you believe one word what this pig dog say. If Miss Barbara marry him he no want shoot you; he {{ask you to}} tea to see the Missus and how much she love him, ducky! <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on and call on Miss Barbara and hear the news. Walk up, Sir Robert Aylward, Bart., and show us which way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{suppose we}} are all pretty much the same, if we only knew it,' he had consoled himself. 'We keep our crazy side to ourselves; that's all. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on {{for years and years}} doing and saying {{whatever}} happens to come up--and really keen about it too'--he had glanced up with a kind of challenge in his face at the squat little belfry--'and then, without the slightest reason or warning, down you go, and it all begins to wear thin, and you get wondering what on earth it all means.' Memory slipped back for an instant to the life that in so unusual a fashion seemed to have floated a little aloof. Fortunately he had not discussed these inward symptoms with his wife. How surprised Sheila would be to see him loafing in this old, crooked churchyard. How she would lift her dark eyebrows, with that handsome, indifferent tolerance. He smiled, but a little confusedly; yet the thought gave even a spice of adventure to the evening's ramble.|$|E

5000|$|We never {{recorded}} as The Sisterhood, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> out and played some gigs. ... Andrew {{recorded as}} The Sisterhood, {{and since he}} released something prior to us he got to claim the name. ... To be terribly honest now, I think Andrew was right. I mean, {{two members of the}} band going off and trading on their old band? It's like two ex-members of The Mission going off and naming themselves as The Missionaries. It's a bit cheap.|$|R
500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bassist David J later {{described}} the incident as [...] "a big {{fight in the}} studio. We weren't going to carry on, and <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> going to dump the album. We were waiting for Peter Murphy to turn up. Our beef was with him. So he comes in, and he does this shocking and brilliant thing. Pure zen. He comes in, and he just spits rose petals in our faces. It just cut through everything. We couldn't argue with that. So <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in and continued recording." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You and I both know they can’t {{go back to}} the other 1967 borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Mick Barr said, [...] "Our {{method for}} writing music has {{remained}} {{more or less}} unchanged since the first album. One of the three song writers will bring forth a song structure and the others will write their parts to it, then we collectively work on it as a band until it feels more or less complete. Or until {{it is time to}} record the album, in which case <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it, and hope we can make it feel finished in the moment." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hard {{to explain}} - Two odd-looking women with broad Birmingham accents explain {{something}} from popular culture {{as if it}} were unknown (e.g. IKEA, which they describe as [...] "always all yellow", [...] "done up in all these rooms... but youre not allowed to sleep in them" [...] and somewhere couples can go to argue). They always begin with the phrase [...] "its quite hard to explain if youve never seen it" [...] and end by making an apparently unwitting sexual innuendo ("and then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> out cock-hunting; you know, hunting for cockerels").|$|E
5000|$|Parata's husband Wira Gardiner {{described}} {{the situation for}} him and Parata during this period in a 2008 interview: [...] "We seriously contemplated whether the National Party {{was ever going to}} be the party for us...but in the end we didn't abandon it, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> to sleep for a while." [...] Reflecting back on this period in 2010, Parata said: [...] "I didn't consider them wilderness years; I had a particular disagreement with a particular person and his outlook at the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{needed this}} friendship—he wanted connection. It's so powerful, {{that you have}} {{people from all walks}} of life who became {{dramatically}} engaged in caring about this single life at sea. He was interested in human beings for a social connection. Luna wanted eye contact, he wanted physical, he wanted almost this mental contact. So how can you not respond to that? We were not sort of whale-huggers. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> there to cover a story. And we were captivated by the character —by him—almost immediately." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{felt there}} were some songs that he had written that had become hits of sorts for other people, that he didn't {{actually}} perform himself," [...] recalls Traum, [...] "and he wanted to fit those on the record as well...So <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in one afternoon and did it, {{it was just the}} two of us and the engineer, and it was very simple...we chose three songs on the spot and mixed them...in the space of an afternoon...Sometimes I wasn't even sure if it was a final take until <b>we</b> would <b>just</b> finish and Bob would say, 'Okay, let's go and mix it.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was around}} July, {{when it was}} very hot outside, that someone {{mentioned}} {{the possibility of the}} four of them taking a private plane over to the foothills of Mount Everest to shoot the cover photograph. But as they became more enthusiastic to finish the LP someone - I don't remember whom - suggested, 'Look, I can't be bothered to schlep all the way over to the Himalayas for a cover, why don't <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> outside, take the photo there, call the LP Abbey Road and have done with it?' That's my memory of why it became Abbey Road: because they couldn't be bothered to go to Tibet and get cold!

500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> sample-crazy. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> ... <b>went</b> through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff {{and putting it}} all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... When we put that record out, we knew {{what we were doing}} was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was at the}} Jazz Festival in New Orleans, in {{this bar}} {{watching}} a Cuban band, {{with a friend of}} mine. We were the last ones there. We walked out and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> around the wrong corner. It happened really fast. There were two guys. They had a gun on my friend and they cut me, and took our wallets. I was bleeding pretty badly. When I went to the hospital, the doctor said, [...] "I don't think this is very good; three of your fingers might be paralyzed." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Joel Quartermain explains [...] With the last record {{we wanted to}} write an album that was very distilled and every song sounded like it came from that record, whereas this time <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in a bunch of different directions. It's all over the shop. We didn't try {{to think about it}} too much as we did last time. It is much less sculptured. It is the heaviest thing we've done, but the album also has the most gentle music we've made as well. Joel Quartermain ...|$|R
5000|$|The Terror is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by {{experimental}} rock band the Flaming Lips, released on April 1, 2013 worldwide and April 16 in the U.S., on Warner Bros in the U.S. and Bella Union in the U.K. It {{is the last}} album to feature drummer Kliph Scurlock who was fired from the band a year after this album's release. Lead vocalist Wayne Coyne described the album's general idea in a press release:"We want, or wanted, to believe that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive {{and if there is}} no love, there would be no life.

5000|$|Saying {{that she}} did not believe that he {{understood}} her, he remarked that he could not until he had listened to all the TV programs. Dori remarked that he was not from around here to which he said [...] "No. I'm from another Planet". Still shocked after thinking he was dead, the Stranger wondered why Dori thought he was dead because he had not began to decomposed. Dori stated that his injuries where fatal to humans. The Stranger explained that his kind regenerate their major organs and die only after they suffer massive damage to their brain. When the Stranger inquired as to humans, Dori jokingly said, [...] "No. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> to work for the Department of Motor Vehicles". Baffled by the joke because his kind do not joke nor understand them, Dori tricks the Stranger and escapes only to be caught at her car with her behind the steering wheel. Attempting to flee, she threaten to run him over. The Stranger stops her by putting his foot on her car's bumper as she tries running him down.|$|E
5000|$|Runnels' autobiography, Cross Rhodes: Goldust, Out of the Darkness, was {{released}} in December 2010. In the book, Runnels mentioned that he was married a second time to an unnamed woman.

We only dated for a few months, then, one day, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> to the {{justice of the peace}} and did the deed."
