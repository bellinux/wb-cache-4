5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, the belief that the baptism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in communion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.|$|E

5|$|In Christian theology, baptism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit (also called baptism in the Holy Spirit or Spirit baptism) is {{distinguished}} from baptism with water.

5|$|Jesus is {{considered}} {{the first person to}} receive the baptism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus during his baptism and anointed him with power.

5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and are incorporated {{into the body of}} Christ.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation.

Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem.

The Apostle Paul was also filled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E

He was adamant {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} revolt, many land (timar) holders were killed or expelled.

While {{the leaders of the}} revolt were successful in defeating successive Ottoman campaigns, they failed to capture many important towns of the sanjak of Albania. Protracted sieges like that of Gjirokastër, capital of the sanjak, gave the Ottoman army time to assemble large forces {{from other parts of the}} empire and to subdue the main revolt by the end of 1436. Ottoman forces conducted a number of massacres in the aftermath of the revolt.|$|E

After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E
