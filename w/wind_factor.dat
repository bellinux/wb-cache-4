40|$|Purpose This {{paper is}} aimed at general {{investigation}} of winding topologies for flux-switching motors (FSM) with various segment-tooth combinations and different excitation methods. Design/methodology/approach For the ac winding of FSM, two winding topologies, namely the concentrated winding and the distributed winding, are compared {{in terms of the}} <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> and efficiency. For the field winding of dc-excited FSM (DCEFSM), another two winding topologies, namely the lap winding and the toroidal winding, are compared in terms of effective coil area, end-winding length, and thermal conditions. Analytical derivation is used for the general <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> calculation. The calculation results are validated using finite element analysis (FEA). Findings <b>Winding</b> <b>factors</b> can be used as an indication of winding efficiency for FSMs {{in the same manner as}} done for synchronous motors (SMs). For FSMs with concentrated windings, the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> increases when the rotor tooth number approaches a multiple of the stator segment number. For FSMs with certain segment-tooth combinations, e. g. 6 / 8, the theoretical maximum <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> can be achieved by implementing distributed windings. Furthermore, the toroidal winding can be an efficient winding topology for DCEFSMs with large stator diameter and small stack length. Research limitations/implications This work can be continued with investigating the variation of reluctance torque with respect to different segment-tooth combinations of FSM. Originality/value This paper proposes a general method to calculate the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> of flux-switching motors using only the phase number, the stator segment number, the rotor tooth number, and the skew angle. Using this method, a table of <b>winding</b> <b>factors</b> of FSMs with different segment-tooth combinations is provided.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{find the}} optimal winding {{topology}} for a 14 -pole permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) {{to be used as}} an in-wheel motor in automotive applications. Design/methodology/approach – Comparison is first performed among lap windings with different combinations of slot numbers and pole numbers. A general method for calculating the <b>winding</b> <b>factors</b> using only these numbers is proposed, thus the preferable slot numbers resulting in relatively large <b>winding</b> <b>factors</b> for this 14 -pole PMSM are found. With these slot numbers, the Joule losses of armature windings are further investigated, where the impacts of different end-winding lengths are considered. By this means, the optimal slot number that causes the least Joule loss is obtained. On the other hand, as a competitor to lap windings, toroidal windings are also discussed. The thermal performances of these two types of windings are compared by performing a finite element analysis (FEA) on their 2 -D thermal models. Findings – For the 14 -pole in-wheel PMSM discussed in this paper, the preferable slot numbers leading to relatively large <b>winding</b> <b>factors</b> are 12, 15 and 18. However, with the specified geometry constraints, the optimal choice of slot number is 15, which results in the least Joule loss and thus the highest efficiency. On the other hand, by implementing the toroidal winding topology, the armature windings of this machine can be effectively cooled and thus allow a larger electrical loading than the lap windings do. Research limitations/implications – This work can be continued with investigating the impacts of different combinations of slot number and pole number on harmonics and cogging torques. Originality/value – This paper proposes a general method for calculating the <b>winding</b> <b>factor</b> of PMSMs using only the phase number, the slot number, and the pole number.

Since the simultaneous sea-ice draft data are also available from a moored ice-profiling sonar (IPS), we examine the dependence of drift characteristics on ice thickness for the first time. As ice thickness increases and wind decreases, the <b>wind</b> <b>factor</b> decreases and the turning angle increases, as predicted by the theory of free drift.

40|$|In estuaries, the {{interaction}} of wind, tidal current, and mixing of fresh and saline water produces a variable depth profile of current, with foam lines and convergence zones between water types. Careful measurement of surface currents via Lagrangian drifters requires a drifter design appropriate to both the depth of current to be measured and the tide and wind conditions of interest. The use of remote sensing to track drifters contributes additional constraints on drifter design. Several designs of biodegradable drifters which emit uranine dye plumes, resolvable in aerial imagery to 1 : 60, 000 scale, were tested for wind drag in field conditions against data from calibrated current meters.

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the ratio}} of sea ice drift speed to surface wind speed, is a key factor for the {{dynamics}} of sea ice and is generally about 2 %. In some coastal oceans, however, the <b>wind</b> <b>factor</b> tends to be larger near the coast. This study proposes the enhancement mechanism of the sea ice drift caused by the dynamical coupling be-tween sea ice and a coastal ocean. In a coastal ocean covered with sea ice, wind-forced sea ice drift excites coastal trapped waves (shelf waves) and generates fluctuating ocean current. This ocean current can enhance sea ice drift when the current direction {{is the same as}} that of the wind-driven drift. The authors consider a simplified setting where spatially uniform oscillating wind drifts sea ice parallel to the coast. When a baro-tropic long shelf wave is assumed for the ocean response, sea ice drifts driven by wind and ocean are obtained analytically. The ratio of ocean-driven to wind-driven sea ice drifts is used for the evaluation of the oceanic contribution to the enhancement of sea ice drift. The enhancement is mostly determined by the characteristics of the shelf waves, and sea ice drift is significantly enhanced close to the coast with lower-frequency wind forcing. Comparison with the observation off the Sakhalin coast shows that the degree of enhancement of sea ice drift and its characteristic such that larger enhancement occurs near the coast are mostly consistent with our theoretical solution, suggesting that this mechanism is present in the real ocean. 1...|$|E

The aim of undertaken researches is to discover relations and connection between natural and antropogenic processes that are influences on coastal dunes. Driven researches consist of: (i) dune relief changes, (ii) plant vegetation dynamics, (iii) human or animal influence, (iv) storm surges impact, (v) <b>wind</b> <b>factor</b> impact, (vi) sediment diversification and dynamics analyses (surface and structures dynamics).
