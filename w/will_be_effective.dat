25|$|Various {{classes of}} Vajrayana {{literature}} {{developed as a}} result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism. The Mañjusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Saiva, Garuda and Vaisnava tantras <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri. The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Saiva text Tantrasadbhava, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.|$|E

Given this, we suggest that children’s savings policies designed to increase college attendance rates <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more <b>effective</b> if they include strategies for building children’s college-bound identity and college-bound identity programs <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more <b>effective</b> if they <b>are</b> linked to children’s savings programs...|$|R

Arsenal had announced the partnership with Puma <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> from 1 July 2014.

500|$|According to Daniel Hoffman, Whitman [...] "is a poet whose {{hallmark}} is anaphora". Hoffman {{describes the}} use of the anaphoric verse as [...] "a poetry of beginnings" [...] and that Whitman's use of its repetition and similarity at the inception of each line is [...] "so necessary as the norm against which all variations and departures are measured...what follows is varied, the parallels and the ensuing words, phrases, and clauses lending the verse its delicacy, its charm, its power". Further, the device allows Whitman [...] "to vary the tempo or feeling, to build up climaxes or drop off in innuendoes" [...] Scholar Stanley Coffman analyzed Whitman's catalogue technique through the application of Ralph Waldo Emersons comment that such lists are suggestive of the metamorphosis of [...] "an imaginative and excited mind". According to Coffman, Emerson adds that because [...] "the universe is the externalization of the soul, and its objects symbols, manifestations of the one reality behind them, Words which name objects also carry with them the whole sense of nature and are themselves to be understood as symbols. [...] Thus a list of words (objects) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> in giving to the mind, under certain conditions, a heightened sense not only of reality but of the variety and abundance of its manifestations." ...|$|E
