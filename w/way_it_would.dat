5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Knightly Dawn {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{somewhat}} elaborate {{rules and}} laws governing succession to the Presidency have long provided fodder for creators of fiction.

25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a sheet of paper and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, {{residents}} of District 3 could enroll {{their children in}} any school within the district. Parents, at the time, did not prefer PS 9. There was a budget crisis in the city. Monies were allocated to the schools based on enrollment. So, {{when a group of}} parents proposed adding a program for a gifted program, O'Brien embraced the idea, thinking that, in many <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> benefit all the students in the building; namely, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> advance the learning environment and warrant more funding from the BOE.|$|R

Fortunately, the Canton Hospital and Lingnan University weren't greatly affected by these attacks. He ran the hospital at this time, which continued to help people with both medical treatment and spiritual guidance.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point {{to remember is that}} cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> on sperm cells.|$|E
25|$|Moral hazard is the {{prospect}} that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that {{they are responsible for}} the consequences of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.|$|E

It wasn't a commercial success, however. Ralph Legnini (a.k.a.

Brian had easily won the title for 1983 and the car, a 1984 Trans Am, legitimizing the {{process in which the}} ABA required for Number 1 pro in 1983 since he was even before the Grand National the top money earner. However, this system was not used again for 1984 and the ABA went back to the system of how well a pro does during a season having a bearing on who wins ABA number one pro.|$|E
25|$|While the Allen and Unwin sheets {{appear to}} have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not phototypeset new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had {{accumulated}} up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its crispness, it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Hence, comparisons of type degradation to sort out the 15th, 16th, and 17th impressions would seem fruitless. Indeed, the 23rd impression's type block seems just as effectively identical.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
30|$|The {{program would}} be jointly {{administered}} by the US Departments of Education and Labor. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be designed to supplement activities and services currently funded through WIA, but with {{much more of a}} focus on helping states and regions build integrated education and workforce systems in response to local job market conditions 37. In some <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be modeled on the “Race to the Top” competitive grants administered to the states by the U.S. Department of Education, which were large enough in magnitude to have a fairly large impact on state planning and policy in their K- 12 systems.|$|R

500|$|The sewer {{processing}} plant scenes were shot at Iona Island Sewage Treatment plant in Canada. The sewer scenes were {{shot in a}} pit on the show's stage, with Carter using his father, {{who worked as a}} construction worker, as a consultant on how to build it. As no ship was available for filming the opening scenes in the Russian freighter, a hydro sub station in Surrey, British Columbia was adapted into an engine room. Carter had to fight with Fox's broadcast standards department over the scene where a victim vomits up a flukeworm while in the shower. James Wong described it as the grossest piece of television ever put on the air. As Gillian Anderson's pregnancy was getting more apparent, the producers started to shoot Scully's scenes in a <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be disguised, with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing".|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{go for a}} shiny, {{high-tech}} {{science fiction}} look, the designers opted to recreate the setting and feel of the original Alien film using the work of concept artists Ron Cobb and Mœbius. As a result, the game features a lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. For example, the game features clunky machinery like phone receivers, monochrome displays, and distorted CRT monitors. To create period authentic distortion on in-game monitors, the developers recorded their in game animations onto VHS and Betamax video recorders, then filmed those sequences playing on an [...] "old curvy portable TV" [...] while adjusting the tracking settings. As digital hacking was not conceived in the 1970s, the game's hacking device was built the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been built {{on the set of}} the movie, and requires players to tune into a computer's signal while selecting icons on its screen.

2500|$|Director Andrey Zvyagintsev {{said the}} project took him {{nearly three years}} to complete, {{starting}} from when he first thought about the plot. The film's screenplay was presented to Zvyagintsev by Artyom Melkumian, an Armenian friend of his {{who worked as a}} television cameraman. Melkumian loved William Saroyan's The Laughing Matter and spent ten years adapting the novel. Originally, the script had a lot of dialogue but Zvyagintsev said that when he started testing it with actors [...] "it was a disaster" [...] and had to remorselessly cut the dialogue. [...] "The long dialogue would be impossible to film in a satisfying <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be very difficult for the actors to hold the viewers' attention for that long," [...] said Zvyagintsev.|$|E
