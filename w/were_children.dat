The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population.

Its results showed that the population had grown to 14,333,915 inhabitants since the 1872 census.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{the growth of}} {{industry}} meant {{the majority of the}} area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power looms. Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many factory workers <b>were</b> <b>children</b> under 12years of age.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there <b>were</b> <b>children</b> {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5–10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) <b>were</b> <b>children.</b> Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E

At first, most of the bodies found by the army were buried normally though due to the high death toll, some were just buried under debris. Some dead bodies were later burned to prevent disease. According to preliminary estimates by officials, 40,000people were made homeless and an addition 20,000were injured, 126of which were considered significant. Within another day, the homeless total rose to70,000. Total damage from the hurricane was estimated at $100million (1976USD).|$|E

From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the East End of London. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish diaspora and {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, a quarter of its population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Growing up in the East End, Aaronson was part of a group of friends who are today referred to as the Whitechapel Boys, all of whom <b>were</b> <b>children</b> of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included John Rodker, Isaac Rosenberg, Joseph Leftwich, Samuel Winsten, Clara Birnberg, David Bomberg, and the brothers Abraham and Joseph Fineberg. Aaronson was also involved in the Young Socialist League, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics. Aaronson remained a committed socialist throughout adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{four more}} games were {{released}} {{as part of}} the World of Mana subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These <b>were</b> <b>Children</b> of Mana (2006), an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the Nintendo DS; Dawn of Mana (2006), a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; Friends of Mana (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; and Heroes of Mana (2007), a real-time strategy game for the DS.

5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, {{from which}} he calls {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute for}} his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they <b>were</b> <b>children</b> and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E

5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 <b>were</b> <b>children,</b> 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there <b>were</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
