5|$|In 1919, Clark {{worked as}} the {{assistant}} to the entomologist on probation in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, but in 1920, he took on this position full-time. He started to publish his first articles about pest insects and ants from 1921; in 1926 he became an entomologist at the National Museum in Melbourne, remaining there for 20 years. Clark continued to publish more articles until he resigned from the National Museum of Victoria in 1944. Living in poverty, Clark lived a reclusive life, publishing his last book in 1951. He died on 1 June 1956 {{at the age of}} 71, survived by his six children. One of Clark's most notable achievements <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> Nothomyrmecia macrops, the most primitive living ant. Several ants have been named after him in recognition of his contributions.|$|E

Initially, Carrie finds no evidence of Brody's involvement with terrorism.|$|E
25|$|In general, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that smaller colonies are less aggressive than larger ones. There are differing observations of the D. arenaria’s personality, one stating that they are quarrelsome and then other arguing that they are not.

Smaller colonies’ colony defense behavior is said to be unpredictable and erratic.|$|E

25|$|His World War I {{services}} are not known, but a dozen William Scotts are {{recorded in the}} armed services at this time. In 1915 he married Lily Edmundson (born 19 August 1891) in Leeds Register Office; she was a tailoress and the daughter of George Edmundson, a machine fitter in 1891 and electrical engineer in 1915. Scott was at that time an artist and caricaturist, living at 79 Buslingthorpe Lane, Leeds; his mother was one of the witnesses at the wedding. They had two daughters: the first was Patricia Shirley born at 1 Highfield Terrace, Golder's Green on 28 September 1919 when Scott described himself as a black and white artist. The second was Marjory Sylvia born at St Edwards maternity home, Station Road, Herne Bay on 4 January 1921. At this point Scott <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> himself as a journalist and living at Roldale House, Selsea Avenue, Herne Bay.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} by, Bradbury tended to dismiss {{censorship}} as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually {{claimed that the}} real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were {{about the dangers of}} an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451, I thought I <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.|$|E

25|$|In 1841 James David Forbes, {{professor}} of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, {{came to see}} the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how {{at a time when the}} idea of Alpine exploration was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by John Ball twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile Gottlieb Samuel Studer, the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he was {{nineteen}} years old in 1871 he was living with his parents in Havelock Road and articled to an attorney. He became a partner in the firm sometime after 1873. By 1881 at age twenty-nine he <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> himself as a timber merchant like his father, and living with his parents at Priory Mount in Cambridge Gardens, Hastings. He continued under the same company name after his father retired in 1882 and the original firm was dissolved. He married Mrs Lilla Harford (b. Barnstaple ca.1856; d. Wandsworth 1930) of Cambridge Gardens, Hastings on 7 June 1882, when his employees received a half-day holiday, an afternoon of entertainment at Field's Farm, Ore and an evening dinner at the Grand Hotel in Queens Road, Hastings. Around a hundred of the men took advantage of this. By 1991 the family was living at Rothesay, Clive Road, Hastings, with five of their children: Cecil, Gladys, Reginald, Mabel and Herbert. They had seven servants living in: a housekeeper, parlourmaid, cook, housemaid, under-nurse, coachman and gardener. The 1901 Census finds John Howell Junior as a solicitor still living with his wife, his stepson Hugh Cardinal Harford (b. Middlesex ca.1877) and five of their children at Rothesay. His eldest son Cecil was at that time a commercial clerk living at a boarding house in Rochester, Kent. John Howell Junior died aged 52 years on 13 December 1903 in his home at 20 Holmesdale Gardens which he had built with his father soon after joining the firm. He left £53,352 in his will.|$|E

500|$|Cauche's {{account is}} problematic, since it also {{mentions}} that the bird he <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> had three toes and no tongue, unlike dodos. This led some {{to believe that}} Cauche <b>was</b> <b>describing</b> a new species of dodo ("Didus nazarenus"). The description was most probably mingled {{with that of a}} cassowary, and Cauche's writings have other inconsistencies. A mention of a [...] "young ostrich" [...] taken on board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile dodo. An egg claimed to be that of a dodo is stored in the museum of East London, South Africa. It was donated by Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed to have found it in a swamp on Mauritius. In 2010, the curator of the museum proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity. It may instead be an aberrant ostrich egg.|$|E
