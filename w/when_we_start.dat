25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> at the point z = 1, then travel up and to the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, where we started.|$|E

That's how we've always worked. And it goes well with how we make music. We do get together down the line and in the studio <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> fleshing out the tracks".|$|E
