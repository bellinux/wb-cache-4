5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently.

Had Ripken not <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> back to third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that labour supply – especially of partnered women with supplemental incomes – is positively associated with homeownership status. This literature is advanced by testing whether <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership before the actual entry into homeownership affects individuals’ labour supply in couples. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991 – 2008). Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to predict the labour supply of women and men separately. Labour supply changes associated with homeownership are found to mainly occur when individuals <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership and prior to the actual entry into homeownership. When <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership, women and men increase their labour supply, where {{women are more likely to}} take up work and men to increase work hours. For women, the association between <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership and labour supply is moderated by regional house price changes...|$|R

According to executive producer Charles Cecil, the game was inspired by crime films Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. In Cold Blood was released on 14 July and 10 October 2000 in Europe, and on 25 March and 30 May 2001 in North America for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.

5|$|By the 1930–31 season, {{the team}} was openly selling players to make ends meet. Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and turned them into the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Sect. 2, {{who would not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and take all services and information with no loss of quality of experience? The rapid {{growth in the number}} of mobile devices puts support mobility as one of key issues in future Internet design. The requirement is to comprehensively support user, terminal, service, application, virtual network, information, and other real and virtual entity mobility. The challenge behind this idea justifies why unique identifiers are needed: it is because we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> real or virtual entities as well as information, without loss of identity, and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> continue finding them during and/or after movement. People <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> without loss of identity and functionality. Services and applications need to follow users as they move.|$|R
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E

The couple were married in 1944 in a Texaco Station in Andalusia, Alabama, by a justice of the peace. The marriage was declared illegal, since Sheppard's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required sixty-day trial reconciliation.|$|E

5|$|Ayrton Senna was a Brazilian racing {{driver who}} won three Formula One world championships. He entered Formula One in 1984 with the Toleman team, but after one season, {{he moved to}} Lotus. He spent three seasons with Lotus before moving to McLaren in 1988. Over the next five years, the intense rivalry between Senna and Alain Prost, a leading Formula One driver, came to the forefront, with {{particularly}} notable race incidents and collisions occurring between the two. Senna won all three of his world championships during his six seasons with McLaren, in 1988, 1990 and 1991. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Williams after 1992, but was prevented from doing so by a clause in Alain Prost's contract. He moved to Williams in 1994, but during the third race of the season, {{he was killed in}} an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. He was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era, and is considered by some as the greatest racing driver of all time.|$|E
5|$|With {{few options}} available, the Sounds signed a PDC with the Chicago White Sox who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their Triple-A farm club {{closer to home}} than their {{previous}} location in Vancouver. The White Sox presented Schmittou {{with a list of}} complaints about the relatively poor condition of Greer Stadium. Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for new stadium to replace Greer. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium. One of those improvements was the addition of Greer's signature guitar-shaped scoreboard, which was installed in 1993.|$|E
