50|$|VfL Wolfsburg {{also became}} the first Bundesliga club to play in an LED-lit stadium when the Volkswagen Arena was {{equipped}} with a new LED floodlight system {{at the start of}} 2017. The old floodlighting of the Volkswagen Arena consists of more than 170 elements with lamps, each weighing about 35 kilos. They were all mounted under the roof and together produce about 1,500 lux. The 84 speakers in the stadium, which weigh 120 kilos each and are likewise mounted under the roof, produce a total of 600 watts. There are also two video walls covering an area of 53 square metres in the stadium. The pitch is covered in hybrid grass, which is natural grass that is reinforced with synthetic fibres, thus improving its <b>weatherability.</b> The Volkswagen Arena was the first Bundesliga stadium to introduce such a system.

40|$|Eight {{urethane}} compounds {{were evaluated}} as possible {{replacement for the}} existing encapsulating compoounds for electrical cables for the Launch Support System at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The existing encapsulating compound, PR- 1535, contains the curative MOCA 4 - 4 '-Methylene-BIS (2 -chloroaniline), which is a suspect carcinogen and hence may {{be the subject of}} further restrictions of its use by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The samples made in the configuration of cable joints and in the form of disks were evaluated for flammability and hypergolic compatibility. These also underwent accelerated <b>weatherability</b> tests that measured the residual hardness of the exposed samples. Three candidates and the existing compound passed the hardness test. Of these, only one candidate and the existing compound passed the flammability test. The thermal and hydrolytic stability (<b>weatherability)</b> of these samples was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (DSC) techniques. The TMA and DSC data correlated with the residual hardness data; whereas, the TGA data showed no correlation.

40|$|This data {{analysis}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} <b>weatherability</b> of steels whose compositions do not fall {{in the range of}} ASTM Standard G 101, Estimating the Atmospheric Corrosion Resistance of Low-Alloy Steels (1). This standard was developed to estimate the corrosion resistance of low-alloy weathering steels from chemical composition data and from actual atmospheric exposure tests. This standard is limited to steels within the composition range outlined in TABLE 1. There are many high-strength, low-alloy steels that are used at the present time or that are under development with chemical composition ranges extending beyond the chemical compositions of steels covered by the ASTM Standard G 101. These steels may contain more nickel and more copper or elements not included in the G 101 Standard. Ability to estimate the <b>weatherability</b> of these steels is of current interest. The G 101 corrosion index, which is used to predict whether a steel is weatherable, is {{based on the work of}} Legault and Leckie (2), who utilized part of an extensive database published by Larrabee and Coburn (3).

40|$|A {{numerical}} model describing the coupled {{evolution of the}} biogeochemical cycles of carbon, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and strontium has been developed to describe the long-term changes of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate during the Phanerozoic. The {{emphasis is on the}} effects of coupling the cycles of carbon and strontium. Various interpretations of the observed Phanerozoic history of the seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio are investigated with the model. More specifically, the abilities of continental weathering, volcanism, and surface lithology in generating that signal are tested and compared. It is suggested that the observed fluctuations are mostly due to a changing <b>weatherability</b> over time. It is shown that such a conclusion is very important for the modelling of the carbon cycle. Indeed, it implies that the conventional belief that the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate on a long time scale is governed by the balance between the volcanic input of CO 2 and the rate of silicate weathering is not true. Rather carbon exchanges between the mantle and the exogenic system are likely to have played a key role too. Further, the increase of the global weathering rates with increasing surface temperature and/or atmospheric CO 2 pressure usually postulated in long-term carbon cycle and climate modelling is also inconsistent with the new model. Other factors appear to have modulated the <b>weatherability</b> of the continents through time, such as mountain building and the existence of glaciers and ice sheets. Based on these observations, a history of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate during Phanerozoic time, consistent with the strontium isotopic data, is reconstructed with the model and is shown to be compatible with paleoclimatic indicators, such as the timing of glaciation and the estimates of Cretaceous paleotemperatures...|$|E
