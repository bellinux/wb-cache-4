25|$|The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, black colobus, {{mandrill}} {{and golden}} potto {{have all been}} listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{the total population of}} the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> species is around 278,000. The ICUN Red List has given the status “Least Concern” to the <b>Water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> Because of its solitary nature, there is very little information about its population in each individual country, but recently there has been evidence that shows the population is declining in some areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> is {{exclusively}} nocturnal, and forages {{for food}} in clearings at night. During the day, the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> hides {{in the dense}} cover of the African brush. The resting postures of the species include lying down and sitting up.Because they’re such a solitary species, the interactions between water chevrotains are only antagonistic and reproductive encounters. Males fight other males, mainly over territory. Their fights are typically short, and in them the two competing males run at each other, mouths open. They poke each other with their muzzles and bite. These aggressive fights {{are thought to be}} the reason that mature male Water chevrotains normally live no closer than several kilometers apart.The <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> has several different noises that it makes, which include a scream when injured/wounded and an alarm bark. When females fight, they make a high pitched chattering noise, and when pursuing a female, males make a noise through a closed mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} over 60 mammal species, {{including}} forest buffalos, leopards, hippos, mona monkeys, <b>water</b> <b>chevrotains,</b> bush babies, civets, elephants, and the pygmy flying squirrel (Idiuus zenkeri). Nine species of duikers {{are found in}} the park, including the bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis). The park has eight primate species and almost 300 butterfly species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> is {{endemic to}} the {{tropical}} regions of Africa. While it primarily {{lives in the}} coastal regions, the species can be found from Sierra Leone to western Uganda.The <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> {{can be found in}} closed canopy moist tropical lowland forest, and within this habitat, they only occupy areas within close range to streams or rivers. The area is rarely inhabited by the species if it is further than 250 m away from water. During the day, chevrotains cannot be found outside of the dense forest; but at night they can be observed in exposed clearings and open river banks.|$|E
50|$|Other animals present {{include the}} long-tailed pangolin, giant pangolin, tree pangolin, Angolan slender mongoose, aquatic genet, hippopotamus, the African golden cat, bushpig, bongo, yellow-backed duiker, sitatunga, okapi, bushbuck, <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> and forest buffalo.|$|E
50|$|The {{musk deer}} of Asia and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> (or mouse deer) of {{tropical}} African and Asian forests {{are not usually}} regarded as true deer and form their own families: Moschidae and Tragulidae, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Various {{parts of}} the plant are used for {{medicinal}} purposes, as food, {{as a source of}} clothing fibre, as a building material, and as a dye. The fruits are eaten by animals such as the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> (Hyemoschus aquaticus), {{also known}} as the fanged deer, is a small {{ruminant}} found in tropical Africa. It is the largest of the ten species of chevrotains, basal even-toed ungulates which are similar to deer but are barely larger than small dogs.|$|E
50|$|The Nepoko, Ituri and Epulu rivers {{flow through}} the reserve.The {{imposing}} Mbiya Mountain overlooks the Epulu village.The reserve is home to about 5,000 okapi, 4,000 elephants, 2,000 leopards, chimpanzees and crocodiles.Other Ituri rain forest animals include forest buffalo and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> The reserve has over 300 species of bird, {{and is one of}} the most important sites for bird conservation in mainland Africa.Nomadic Mbuti pygmies and indigenous Bantu farmers also live within the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Unusually {{for most}} vertebrates, female water {{chevrotains}} {{are larger than}} males. On average, they weigh over two kilograms more than the 10 kg males. Their body length is about 85 cm, and their shoulder height is around 35 cm.Water chevrotains have a rich, sleek red-brown coat on top, and {{the underside of the}} coat is white. On the body, there is a pattern of white stripes that run horizontally from the shoulder to the tail, with vertical rows of white stripes in the back. The chin, throat and chest are covered in very course hair with a pattern of white V shapes.The back end of the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> has many powerful muscles and is higher than the shoulders, which makes the body slope downward. The head is held down toward the ground while walking, which allows the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> to navigate easily through thickets of dense brush. There is a layer of thick, reinforced skin on the dorsal surface, which protects the back from injuries caused by the thick brush. The legs look short and thin compared to the bulky body, and the hooves are similar to a pig’s. The tail is short with a fluffy white underside that resembles a cotton ball.|$|E
50|$|About {{the size}} of a raccoon or {{domestic}} cat, this onmivorous pig-like creature shared some of the traits of whales, and showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer coating. Their bones were similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and helped reduce buoyancy so that they could stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.|$|E
50|$|The Saint John River has {{a variety}} of aquatic life in and along the shores over the length to the river. Species include the Slender-snouted Crocodile on inland {{portions}} of the waterway. There are at least 65 species of fish in the river, including species of Mastacembelidae, Barbus eburneensis, Chrysichthys johnelsi, Killifish, Electric catfish, Nile perch, and Tilapia among others. Birds also use the riverbanks and islands as nesting grounds, including the Three-cusped Pangolin, Palaearctic, Sandpipers, Greenshanks, Little Ringed Plover, and <b>Water</b> <b>Chevrotain</b> in the Kpatawee Wetlands area in Bong County.|$|E
50|$|The {{family is}} {{widespread}} and successful from the Oligocene (34 million years ago) through the Miocene (about 5 million years ago), but has remained almost unchanged over {{that time and}} remains {{as an example of}} primitive ruminant form. They have four-chambered stomachs to ferment tough plant foods, but the third chamber is poorly developed. Though most species feed exclusively on plant material, the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> occasionally takes insects and crabs, or scavenges meat and fish. Like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors. They give birth to only a single young.|$|E
50|$|Mammal {{species of}} {{conservation}} concern include chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), king colobus (Colobus polykomos), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys lunulatus), Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana rolowayi), western palm squirrel (Epixerus ebi), African linsang (Poiana richardsoni liberiensis), African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana africana)), <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> (Hyemoschus aquaticus), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), Maxwell's duiker (Philantomba maxwellii), red-flanked duiker (Cephalophus rufilatus), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus silvicultor), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus), oribi (Ourebia ourebi), bohor reedbuck (Redunca redunca), kob (Kobus kob kob), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa), western hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus major), and roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus).|$|E
50|$|They are solitary or live in pairs. The {{young are}} weaned at {{three months of}} age, and reach sexual {{maturity}} between five and 10 months, depending on species. Parental care is relatively limited. Although they lack the types of scent glands found in most other ruminants, they do possess a chin gland for marking each other as mates or antagonists, and, {{in the case of}} the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain,</b> anal and preputial glands for marking territory. Their territories are relatively small, on the order of 13 - 24 ha, but neighbors generally ignore each other, rather than compete aggressively.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} Burkina Faso include aardvark, African bush elephant, African civet, African clawless otter, African golden cat, African ground squirrel, West African wild dog, western dwarf buffalo, bushbuck, Cape hare, Cape hyrax, caracal, Northwest African cheetah, common chimpanzee, common genet, Dorcas gazelle, fennec fox, four-toed hedgehog, giant pangolin, West African giraffe, Egyptian wolf, grivet, Guinea baboon, hamadryas baboon, Haussa genet, hippopotamus, African leopard, West African lion, olive baboon, oribi, pale fox, patas monkey, ratel, red-fronted gazelle, reedbuck, roan antelope, rusty-spotted genet, Senegal bushbaby, serval, side-striped jackal, slender {{mongoose}}, speckle-throated otter, spotted hyena, striped hyena, striped polecat, sun squirrel, tree pangolin, warthog, <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain,</b> western hartebeest, white-tailed mongoose and wildcat.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{elephant}} {{is particularly}} important {{to the park and}} is believed by the WWF to contain one of the largest populations in Africa. The lesser forest in the park is inhabited by elephants, gorillas, and various small carnivores, porcupines, squirrels, african golden cats, leopards, giant pangolins, duikers and red river hog. The primary forest is inhabited by creatures such as mandrill, black colobus and chimpanzee. The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, black colobus, mandrill and golden potto have all been listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
50|$|Indohyus {{was a small}} chevrotain-like {{animal that}} lived about 48 million years ago {{in what is now}} the Kashmir. It belongs to the {{artiodactyl}} family Raoellidae, and {{is believed to be the}} closest sister group of Cetacea. Indohyus is identified as an artiodactyl because it has two trochlea hinges, a trait unique to artiodactyls. About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this omnivorous creature shared some traits of modern whales, most notably the involucrum, a bone growth pattern which is the diagnostic characteristic of any cetacean; this is not found in any other species. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including dense limb bones that reduce buoyancy so that they could stay underwater, which are similar to the adaptations found in modern aquatic mammals such as the hippopotamus. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.|$|E
50|$|Also found are two bats, Buettikofer's epauletted {{fruit bat}} (Epomops buettikoferi) and Aellen's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros marisae), Pel's flying {{squirrel}} (Anomalurus peli), giant pangolin (Manis gigantea), tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis) and long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), Liberian mongoose (Liberiictus kuhni), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), leopard (Panthera pardus), African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), which in 2001 numbered only about 100 {{individuals in the}} south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979, red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni ivoriensis), dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) numbered at around 500 in 1996 {{is one of the few}} viable populations remaining, <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> (Hyemoschus aquaticus), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) and an exceptional variety of forest duikers including Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki), banded or zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra), Maxwell's duiker (Cephalophus maxwelii), Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus). Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi), the Edward's swamp rat (Malacomys edwardsi) and the woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). Also recorded in the park is Stochomys defua, which is characteristic of secondary forest.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly {{called the}} “Zaire” (Kongo nzere, [...] "the river that {{swallows}} all rivers"), the Congo's origin is {{traced to the}} Chambeshi (discovered by Livingstone) in Zambia. The Kalambo River has one of Africa’s highest waterfalls (250 meters) at the Zambia/Tanzania border. The Chambeshi contributes to the Bangweulu Swamp, home to both the black lechwe and the Bemba people. (Livingstone died there searching for the Nile source.) Other denizens include the oribi, tsessebe (relative of the gnu), African lungfish and the stork-like shoebill. The Luapula and Lualaba Rivers are followed, as is the Lake Tanganyika effluent river, the Lukuga. Tanganyika provides habitat for Limnocnida (freshwater jellyfish), the Bichir (a primitive fish), water cobra, the spotted-necked otter and diverse populations of cichlids. The abandoned “country estate” of Col. Stewart Gore-Browne (incorrectly called “Henry” in the series) — known as Shiwa Ngandu — is visited. It is in northern Zambia. The Congo’s course is picked up again far downstream where it forms {{a part of the}} border between Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo. The wider river here hosts elephant-snout fish, north African catfish, and the <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> “Bai” (Biaka, “glades”) provide habitat for elephant, hippo and the western lowland gorilla, which numbers as many as 50,000 within the Odzala National Park. River martins swarm massively. The Congo is so wide here that it forms an effective barrier between two related species of ape: the common chimp on the north bank and the bonobo (pygmy chimp) on the south. The sequence makes another huge jump here, to the Livingstone Falls just below Kinshasa. Finally, Gabon's Loango National Park is visited — the last place where large African animals may still be seen wild on a seashore.|$|E
5000|$|Hunting is {{a primary}} way in which Efe men {{contribute}} to the food supply of the tribe, which they were observed doing 21.1% of the time during 12-hour observation days.(p. 42) They hunt either alone or in groups, using either spears or bows and arrows (the arrows may be iron-tipped or poison-tipped, {{depending on the type}} of prey). Monkeys are hunted alone using poison-tipped arrows, which is done by solitary hunters who locate groups of monkeys feeding in trees and stand where they think the monkeys will move. Once they are within 70 feet, an Efe archer fires several arrows and, if he hits one of the monkeys, he will either try to follow it up to 100 metres through the forest (waiting for the poison to set in), or he will return later (the same day or the next morning) in order to bring it back to camp. Poison-tipped arrows are labor-intensive to make (the poisonous roots and vines have to be gathered and then crushed up to turn them into a juice that can be used to coat the arrow tip), and are made in batches of about 75, with about 5.9 minutes spent on each arrow. Duikers (a type of antelope) are hunted either in groups or ambushed alone from trees with iron-tipped arrows. The ambush hunts are called ebaka, and they are performed by building perches in fruit trees from which the duikers eat dropped fruits and waiting there during feeding hours, which are early morning and late afternoon. If the hunter hits a duiker, he will jump out of the 2.5- to-3- meter perch and chase it, and call the dogs to join him. Sometimes, though, the animal gets away, since they can run the distance of several football fields away in the dense forest, even wounded. Group hunts, which are called mota, take place with between 4 and 30 men who use either spears for large animals (like forest buffalo and elephant) or iron-tipped arrows for duikers, other species of antelope, and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain.</b> They also use their dogs to drive game out of their hiding and/or sleeping places and to chase down wounded animals.(pp. 79-82) ...|$|E
50|$|Outside of the rainforest, the crowned eagle's diet {{tends to}} be {{somewhat}} more diverse. While they may take monkeys on a relatively small scale, other families, largely the antelopes and the hyraxes, are the leading prey. In some wooded hillside nests in Kenya, {{about half of the}} remains were from small antelope. The predominant prey species there is the Suni (Neotragus moschatus). In the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania, antelope make up about 30% of the dietary intake at nests, much of this being the Suni again. Adults antelope of a similarly small size to the Suni, around 5 kg or slightly less, are readily hunted, such as Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) and the blue duiker (Philantomba monticola). Larger antelopes, often weighing around 10 kg as adults, may be attacked (mainly calves but also an occasional adult), including klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), Sharpe's grysbok (R. sharpei) and about a half dozen smallish duikers (especially the red forest duiker (Cephalophus natalensis)). Amongst even bigger antelope species that may be hunted, such as bushbuck, Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) and impala (Aepyceros melampus), calves are usually taken but sometimes small adult females may be hunted. The biggest duikers to have been killed weighed an estimated 20 kg. The heaviest accurately weighed bushbuck to be killed by a crowned eagle scaled 15.9 kg, but other ones killed by eagles that have been larger include one around 20 kg and another estimated at 30 kg, or about eight times the eagle's own weight. Furthermore, the remains of another adult-sized bushbuck estimated to weigh 28.8 kg were found as the prey of crowned eagles in South Africa. National Geographic recorded video depicting a crowned eagle stalking a <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> (Hyemoschus aquaticus) (the only African representative of a small-bodied, deer-like family) along a rainforest river but show the chevrotain evading the eagle by submerging and swimming away from it. The taking of ungulates on a large scale, unlike primates, is not unique to the crowned eagle. The martial eagle was reported in Tsavo East National Park to hunt mainly dik-diks and elsewhere has exceptionally killed large duiker weighing up to 37 kg. Even more impressive feats of ungulate-hunting have been credited to the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) and especially the golden eagle, despite these being considered less powerful than the crowned eagle. Both Aquila take mainly neonatal lambs and deer fawns but can attack adult sheep and other large prey (i.e. full-grown kangaroos, emus, pronghorns, reindeer, etc.). The largest prey attacked by any living raptor is probably the up to 114 kg calves killed by golden eagles. All four currently recognized species of hyrax have been hunted by crowned eagles. The greatest level of predation for this family has been directed at Southern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax arboreus), but when they become locally abundant, rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) can become the species' preferred prey.|$|E
40|$|Human {{conflicts}} {{may sometimes}} benefit wildlife by depopulating wilderness areas {{but there is}} evidence from Africa that the impacts tend to be negative. The forested states of West Africa have experienced much recent human conflict {{but there have been}} no assessments of impacts on the wildlife. We conducted surveys of mammals in the 710 -km 2 Gola Forest reserves {{to assess the impact of}} the 1991 - 2001 civil war in Sierra Leone. Gola is the most important remaining tract of lowland forest in the country and a key site for the conservation of the highly threatened forests of the Upper Guinea region. We found that Gola has survived well despite being in the heart of the area occupied by the rebels. We recorded 44 species of larger mammal, including 18 threatened, near-threatened and endemic species, accounting for all species recorded in pre-war surveys and adding several more (African buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus and <b>water</b> <b>chevrotain</b> Hyemoschus aquaticus). Populations of primates were healthy with little evidence of decline. Duiker detection rates were low and further work is required to confirm their numbers as they include five species endemic (or near endemic) to the Upper Guinea region, three of which are threatened. However, the population of African forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis has collapsed, with only a few individuals remaining from c. 110 in the mid 1980 s. We conclude that peacetime pressures from the bushmeat trade, clearance for agriculture, logging and mining are likely to be far greater for Gola than the pressures from the civil war...|$|E
