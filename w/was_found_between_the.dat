5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} the inner circle until later that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.|$|E

25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative difference <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E
25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring in the placebo group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
500|$|Today, 78 skins of {{the great}} auk remain, mostly in museum collections, along with {{approximately}} 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons. All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage, and only two of these are immature. No hatchling specimens exist. Each egg and skin has been assigned a number by specialists. Although thousands of isolated bones were collected from nineteenth century Funk Island to Neolithic middens, only a few complete skeletons exist. Natural mummies also are known from Funk Island, and the eyes and internal organs {{of the last two}} birds from 1844 are stored in the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen. The whereabouts of the skins from the last two individuals has been unknown for more than a hundred years, however, that mystery has been partly resolved using DNA extracted from the organs of the last individuals and the skins of the candidate specimens suggested by Errol Fuller [...] (those in Übersee-Museum Bremen, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Zoological Museum of Kiel University, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, and Landesmuseum Natur und Mensch Oldenburg). A positive match <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> organs from the male individual and the skin now in the RBINS in Brussels. No match <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> female organs and a specimen from Fuller's list, but authors speculate that the skin in Cincinnati museum of Natural History and Science may be a potential candidate due to a common history with the L.A. specimen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intrinsic}} parity of a pion is P=−1, and parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Therefore, the two final {{states have}} different parity (P=+1 and P=−1, respectively).

However, with increasingly precise measurements, no difference <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> masses and lifetimes of each, respectively, indicating {{that they are the}} same particle.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was operating a test flight from Pridacha Airport, Voronezh, Russia, when it crashed at Garbuzovo, Alexeevsky Region, Belgorod Oblast, some [...] south of Moscow, and [...] east of Belgorod. The accident occurred at 11:05 local time (08:05 UTC) and the {{aircraft was}} destroyed in the subsequent fire. Witnesses stated that a wing had separated from the aircraft while in flight. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (...) confirmed that there was wreckage in two separate locations, [...] apart. Further wreckage <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sites.

2500|$|Another current open {{question}} is whether genetic influences are important for the likeliness of co-twins {{to change in the}} same way over a period of time. A link <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> personality trait of neuroticism and a polymorphism called 5-HTTLPR in the serotonin transporter gene, but this association was not replicated in larger studies. Other candidate gene studies have provided weak evidence that some personality traits are related to AVPR1A ("ruthlessness gene") and MAOA ("Warrior gene"). [...] Genotypes, or the genetic make up of an organism, influence but don't fully decide the physical traits of a person. Those are also influenced by the environment and behaviors they are surrounded by. For example, a person's height is affected by genetics, but if they are malnourished growth will be stunted no matter what their genetic coding says. [...] Environment is also not completely responsible for an outcome in personality. An example from Psychobiology of Personality by Marvin Zuckerman is alcoholism: [...] Studies suggest that alcoholism is an inherited disease, but if a subject with a strong biological background of alcoholism in their family tree is never exposed to alcohol, they will not be so inclined regardless of their genome.|$|E

2500|$|Genasauria {{contains}} a medial offset of the maxillary dentition (buccal emargination), which is {{commonly referred to}} as the ‘ornithischian cheek.' Other characteristics of the ornithischian cheek include “a deep-set position of the tooth rows, away from the sides of the face, a spout-shaped front to the mandibles, and reduction {{in the size of the}} opening on the outside of the lower jaw (the external mandibular foramen)." [...] The ornithischian cheek is largely inferred to be evidence for the possession of muscular cheeks that were used for complex chewing behavior and is a fundamentally Genasaurian characteristic. Galton (1973) also suggests that the ornithischian cheek <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> maxillary and dentary ridges to prevent the loss of food through the jaws. It may have consisted of connective tissue and skin, rather than muscle fibers, which meant that the tongue was used to move food that had accumulated between the teeth and the cheek, back to the tongue side of the cheek so that it could be further broken down by the teeth. The ornithischian cheek is absent or only weakly developed in Lesothosaurus, which supports its placement as a sister group to Genasauria.|$|E
2500|$|Richard L.

2500|$|The Metropolitan {{electrified}} its {{new line}} from Harrow to Uxbridge and {{the route to}} the inner circle at Baker Street, using separate positive and negative conductor rails energised at 550–600V. [...] The District electrified its unopened line from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to South Harrow and used this line to test its new trains and train drivers. Electric multiple units began running on the Metropolitan in January 1905 and by March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. Electric services began on the District Railway in June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton. In July 1905 the District began running electric trains from Ealing to Whitechapel and {{on the same day}} the Met and the District both introduced electric units on the inner circle until later that day an incompatibility <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District track.

In the same month, after withdrawing services over the un-electrified East London Railway and east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. The GWR electrified the line between Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the route in November 1906. In the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District's station at Whitechapel. The Metropolitan Railway beyond Harrow was not electrified so services were hauled by an electric locomotive from Baker Street and changed for a steam locomotive en route.|$|E
