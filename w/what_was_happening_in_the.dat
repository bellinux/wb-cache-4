5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

25|$|By 1873 the Colonial Office in London came to {{perceive}} Ord as incompetent. He was soon replaced by Sir Andrew Clarke and Clarke {{was ordered to}} get a complete picture of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason was that London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on {{the economy of the}} Malay states, including Perak. After Clarke's arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted the once apparent heir.|$|E

It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through {{the early part of}} the storm although the presenters were obviously in fear for their lives.

The group included Þorsteinn Pálsson, Geir H.

Buchanan, who all visited Iceland in the early 1980s and whose messages of limited governments, privatisation, and liberalisation of the economy had a wide impact.|$|E

500|$|All local {{television}} stations were disrupted. Local television stations, and newspapers, {{moved quickly to}} sister locations in nearby cities. [...] New Orleans CBS-affiliate WWL-TV was the only local station {{to remain on the}} air during and after the storm, broadcasting from Baton Rouge. Broadcasting and publishing on the Internet became an important means of distributing information to evacuees {{and the rest of the}} world, with news networks citing blogs like Interdictor and Gulfsails for reports of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.

People were desperately trying to police their thoughts, but it was {{difficult}} to keep secrets when staff members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters." [...] Wright reports that David Miscavige's statements were transcribed for the executives in the Hole, who would then have to repeatedly read them out loud to each other.|$|E
500|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{perceived}} as the unwillingness of Puerto Ricans to demand their independence from the United States while the island territory was annexed (the event occurred just days before his death), he uttered his final political stance: [...] "No quiero colonia, ni con España, ni con los Estados Unidos" [...] ("I don't want a colony status, neither with Spain nor with the United States").

500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent {{around the turn of the}} century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E
500|$|For the sequel, Zombie {{only used}} Carpenter's {{original}} theme {{music in the}} final scene of the film, though the director admits that he and music composer Tyler Bates tried to find other places to include it. According to Zombie, Carpenter's music did not fit with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film; whenever he or Bates would insert it into a scene it [...] "just wouldn't feel right" [...] to the director. Zombie also used popular culture songs throughout the film, with [...] "Nights in White Satin" [...] appearing the most prominently. Zombie chose songs that he liked, and that would enhance a given scene within the film. An official soundtrack for the film was released on August 25, 2009. In addition, an album featuring the music of psychobilly band Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures was released in conjunction with Halloween II on August 28, 2009. Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures is a fictional band that appears in Halloween II. Nan Vernon, who recorded {{a new version of}} the song [...] "Mr. Sandman" [...] for the end credits of the 2007 remake, recorded a cover of [...] "Love Hurts" [...] for Halloween II.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm, the {{developers}} {{had to write}} a completely new program. They found that making the ship move was easy, but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex. As such, they created a complete roll editor, called the Darkwave editor, which allowed them to control the pitch (when the ship moves on the horizontal axis) and the roll (when it moves on the vertical axis) separately. The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements. This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game without having to use a cutscene. However, creating such a realistic movement system led to camera problems. According to programmer, Claude Levastre, early in development, [...] "the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement. So we had to develop an inertia-control system for the camera, just as if a cameraman is using a steadicam behind the hero." [...] Another change {{brought about by the}} ship's motion was that initially, the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship were scripted, but this was later replaced with real physics.|$|E
