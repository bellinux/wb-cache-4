25|$|On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard {{completed}} the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on Reagan. This PIA project came in under budget, and it marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, {{as well as}} the largest public-sector <b>work</b> <b>package</b> ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island located near Coronado, California (pictured). During the maintenance period, Ronald Reagan received technological upgrades that prepared it for its next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment to improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the U.S. Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the U.S. defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB).|$|E

40|$|Recently, state {{agencies}} have been successfully implementing construction manager/general contractor (CM/GC) delivery on highway projects. While early <b>work</b> <b>packaging</b> is frequently cited in the literature as a primary benefit of CM/GC, there is limited to substantiate or refute these benefits. Additionally, agencies need {{a better understanding of}} the current state-of-practice of early work packing in CM/GC to help with effective implementation. In an ongoing Federal Highway Agency research project, 12 of 34 completed CM/GC projects reported the use early <b>work</b> <b>packaging,</b> and will be the focus of this study. Research methods used within this paper include: literature review, content review of agency manuals/instructions, project surveys, agency interviews, and case studies. Triangulated findings suggest that early <b>work</b> <b>packaging</b> can contribute to expediting project completion, mitigating project risks, reducing project cost, and minimizing public impacts. To achieve these outcomes, agencies must perform detailed planning to generate severable/independent packages that take into account all potential impacts to the project. Trends in data indicate that early <b>work</b> <b>packages</b> can lead to cost savings, yet the sample size does not provide statistical significance. Future research should explore the performance of a larger data set of CM/GC projects with and without early <b>work</b> <b>packaging</b> along with a cost/benefit analysis of early <b>work</b> <b>packages...</b>|$|R
