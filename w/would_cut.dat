5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the brain to maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating oil, cooling water, maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} phase of their operation, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off Da Nang from the {{surrounding}} regions which made up I Corps Tactical Zone, and prevent reinforcements from retaking the city. Then, depending on the situation, the North Vietnamese would organize an attack to capture the major South Vietnamese army, navy and air force installations in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Nestlé {{announced}} on 20 September 2006 that it <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> 645 {{jobs at the}} Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came {{after a number of}} other job losses in the city at Aviva, British Sugar and Terry's chocolate factory. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began to be felt.|$|E
5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanking was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanking would make it easy for the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanking <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off the defenders' retreat.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off the wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite {{the installation of}} mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E

Fielder-Civil's father encouraged fans to boycott Winehouse's music, and Mitch Winehouse said this would not help. Fielder-Civil was quoted in a British tabloid as saying he introduced Winehouse to crack cocaine and heroin. During a visit with Mitch Winehouse at the prison in July 2008, Fielder-Civil reportedly {{said that he and}} Winehouse <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> themselves to ease the pain of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a {{comprehensive}} rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought {{to cut the}} flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E

25|$|On December 14, 1976, the NYCTA {{proposed}} another {{package of}} service cuts. The cuts, {{planned to take}} effect in January 1977, would have eliminated service on the Bowling Green–South Ferry Shuttle, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and AA service, {{which was to be}} replaced by the A during late nights. GG service <b>would</b> be <b>cut</b> back to Queens Plaza during late evenings and late nights. B and N service <b>would</b> have been <b>cut</b> back to shuttles, running between 36th Street and Coney Island on their respective lines. It was also proposed that during off-peak hours 10-car trains <b>would</b> be <b>cut</b> to eight, six or four car trains.|$|R

5|$|Cotton was the South's primary export and {{the basis}} of its economy, and the system of {{production}} the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The Union blockade of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South's military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.|$|E
5|$|Following these failed German offensives, {{the town}} of Falaise became a major {{objective}} of Commonwealth forces, since its capture <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> off virtually all of Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge's Army Group B. To achieve this, General Harry Crerar, commanding the newly formed Canadian 1st Army and Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds—commanding the Canadian II Corps, planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive with the code name of Operation Totalize. This offensive was designed {{to break through the}} defences in the Anglo-Canadian sector of the Normandy front. Operation Totalize would rely on an unusual night attack using heavy bombers and the new Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers to achieve a breakthrough of German defences. Despite initial gains on Verrières Ridge and near Cintheaux, the Canadian Army's offensive stalled on 9 August, with strong Wehrmacht counterattacks resulting in heavy casualties for the Canadian and Polish armoured and infantry divisions. By 10 August, Canadian troops had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. They were unable to advance farther immediately and they had been unable to capture Falaise.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
5|$|Operation Citadel {{called for}} a double envelopment, {{directed}} at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders of five armies and seal off the salient. Army Group Centre would provide General Walter Model's 9th Army to form the northern pincer. It <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> through the northern face of the salient, driving south to the hills east of Kursk, securing the rail line from Soviet attack. Army Group South would commit the 4th Panzer Army, under Hermann Hoth, and Army Detachment Kempf, under Werner Kempf, to pierce the southern face of the salient. This force would drive north to meet the 9th Army east of Kursk. Von Manstein's main attack was to be delivered by Hoth's 4th Panzer Army, spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser. The XLVIII Panzer Corps, commanded by Otto von Knobelsdorff, would advance on the left while Army Detachment Kempf would advance on the right. The 2nd Army, {{under the command of}} Walter Weiss, would contain the western portion of the salient.|$|E
5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that <b>would</b> <b>cut</b> {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
