Landsat TM digital data covering the region was assessed to identify bottom type variations. <b>Water</b> <b>reflectance</b> model and ratioing algorithm based on the depth of penetration (DOP) zone were employed to correct the Landsat TM digital data for each channel before using as an input to the supervised multispectral classification processes. Classification accuracy assessment was conducted, {{and as a result}} classification based on the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> model has higher accuracy (83. 87 %) than the ratioing algorithm (51. 61 %). Based on these results Takabonerate bottom type mapping was performed with the input data corrected by the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> model...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{we present}} a {{radiative}} transfer model, so-called OSOAA, that is able to predict the radiance and degree of polarization within the coupled atmosphere-ocean system {{in the presence of}} a rough sea surface. The OSOAA model solves the radiative transfer equation using the successive orders of scattering method. Comparisons with another operational radiative transfer model showed a satisfactory agreement within 0. 8 %. The OSOAA model has been designed with a graphical user interface to make it user friendly for the community. The radiance and degree of polarization are provided at any level, from the top of atmosphere to the ocean bottom. An application of the OSOAA model is carried out to quantify the directional variations of the <b>water</b> leaving <b>reflectance</b> and degree of polarization for phytoplankton and mineral-like dominated waters. The difference between the <b>water</b> leaving <b>reflectance</b> at a given geometry and that obtained for the nadir direction could reach 40 %, thus questioning the Lambertian assumption of the sea surface that is used by inverse satellite algorithms dedicated to multi-angular sensors. It is shown as well that the directional features of the <b>water</b> leaving <b>reflectance</b> are weakly dependent on wind speed. The quantification of the directional variations of the <b>water</b> leaving <b>reflectance</b> obtained in this study should help to correctly exploit the satellite data that will be acquired by the current or forthcoming multi-angular satellite sensors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWorldwide, {{coral reef}} {{ecosystems}} are being increasingly threatened by sediments loads from river discharges, {{which in turn}} are influenced by changing rainfall patterns due to climate change and by growing human activity in their watersheds. In this case study, we explored the applicability of using remote sensing (RS) technology to estimate and monitor the relationship between water quality at the coral reefs around the Rosario Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, and the rainfall patterns in the Magdalena River watershed. From the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), this study used the <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> product (MOD 09 GQ) to estimate <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> {{as a proxy for}} sediment concentration and the land cover product (MCD 12 Q 1 V 51) to characterize land cover of the watershed. Rainfall was estimated by using the 3 B 43 V 7 product from the Tropical Rainforest Measuring Mission (TRMM). For the first trimester of each year, we investigated the inter-annual temporal variation in <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> at the Rosario Islands and at the three main mouths of the Magdalena River watershed. No increasing or decreasing trends of <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> were detected for any of the sites for the study period 2001 – 2014 (p> 0. 05) but significant correlations were detected among the trends of each site at the watershed mouths (r= 0. 57 – 0. 90, p< 0. 05) and between them and the inter-annual variation in rainfall on the watershed (r= 0. 63 – 0. 67, p< 0. 05). Those trimesters with above-normal <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> at the mouths and above-normal rainfall at the watershed coincided with La Niña conditions while the opposite was the case during El Niño conditions. Although, a preliminary analysis of inter-annual land cover trends found only cropland cover in the watershed to be significantly correlated with <b>water</b> surface <b>reflectance</b> at two of the watershed mouths (r= 0. 58 and 0. 63, p< 0. 05), the validation analysis draw only a 40. 7 % of accuracy in this land cover classification. This requires further analysis to confirm the impact of the cropland on the water quality at the watershed outlets.

40|$|Traditional {{methods for}} aerosol {{retrieval}} and atmospheric correction of remote sensing data over water surfaces {{are based on}} the assumption of zero <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> in the near-infrared. Another type of approach which is becoming very popular in atmospheric correction over water is based on the simultaneous retrieval of atmospheric and water parameters through the inversion of coupled atmospheric and bio-optical water models. Both types of approaches may lead to substantial errors over optically-complex water bodies, such as case II waters, in which a wide range of temporal and spatial variations in the concentration of water constituents is expected. This causes the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> in the near-infrared to be non-negligible, and that the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> response under extreme values of the water constituents cannot be described by the assumed bio-optical models. As an alternative to these methods, the SCAPE-M atmospheric processor is proposed in this paper for the automatic atmospheric correction of ENVISAT/MERIS data over inland waters. A-priori assumptions on the water composition and its spectral response are avoided by SCAPE-M by calculating reflectance of close-to-land water pixels through spatial extension of atmospheric parameters derived over neighboring land pixels. This approach is supported by the results obtained from the validation of SCAPE-M over a number of European inland water validation sites which is presented in this work. MERIS-derived aerosol optical thickness, <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> and water pigments are compared to in-situ data acquired concurrently to MERIS images in 20 validation match-ups. SCAPE-M has also been compared to specific processors designed for the retrieval of lake water constituents from MERIS data. The performance of SCAPE-M to reproduce ground-based measurements under a range of water types and the ability of MERIS data to monitor chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin pigments using semiempirical algorithms after SCAPE-M processing are discussed. It has been found that SCAPE-M is able to provide high accurate <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> over turbid waters, outperforming models based on site-specific bio-optical models, although problems of SCAPE-M to cope with clear waters in some cases have also been identified. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The {{aim of this study}} consists of identifying spectral bands related to limnological condition of Passo Real Reservoir in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We used <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> data from FieldSpec spectroradiometer and from four limnological variables in 31 samples stations in the reservoir collected in the months of October of 2009 and March of 2010. The measured variables were: total suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll-a and water transparency. With the analysis of the water spectral response from the reservoir we found the optically active constituents influence. Higher concentration of total suspended solids resulted in an increase of reflectance in the wavelengths from 570 to 680 nm. The main absorption features corresponding to the red region (610 and 675 nm) are due to chlorophyll-a and under high concentrations of this constituent we also found absorption feature in the blue region (438 nm). In cases of low concentrations of total suspended solids and chlorophyll-a, the water transparency presented strong correlations with the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> in all wavelengths.

In situ measurements gathered in 5 lakes in October 2014 during satellite data acquisition enabled the characterization of <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> and clarity and supported image processing.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{retrieval of}} marine reflectance from remotely sensed data {{depends on the}} effective removal of {{the contribution of the}} atmosphere to the total signal that reaches the sensor {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, i. e. the atmospheric correction process. This is particularly important in highly turbid waters where assumptions made by traditional atmospheric correction algorithms for open ocean waters are often invalid. We have analyzed three different atmospheric correction algorithms in the challenging turbid waters of La Plata River estuary located in the western Atlantic coast at ~ 35 ° S. Three algorithms were applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the region, the standard near-infrared (NIR) algorithm and two algorithms that use the short wave infrared (SWIR) bands. The two SWIR algorithms differ in the way the aerosol model is selected. The standard NIR atmospheric correction completely failed in retrieving <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> in the river plume waters mainly due to sensor saturation and an incorrect estimation of the marine contribution in the NIR. The standard SWIR approach showed better results, but unphysical correlations between marine features and atmospheric products, such as aerosol reflectance, in the most turbid part of the estuary were clearly identified. The use of an iterative SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach that accounts for non-zero <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> in the SWIR bands seems to be a good alternative for retrieving accurate marine reflectance. The difference in the derived <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> between the two SWIR approaches showed a spectral dependence, being higher in the shorter wavelengths and lower in the NIR.

40|$|Phytoplankton plays {{a crucial}} role in the world carbon cycle and marine food web. However, impact of global warming on {{phytoplankton}} species composition and abundance remains uncertain. This is particularly true in the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas where global warming tends to be the most pronounced. Ocean color satellite images therefore represent an essential tool for providing a synoptic view of marine environments at spatial and temporal resolutions that traditional sampling methods are unable to acquire. However, over icy waters the quality of satellite images is largely affected by sea ice contamination.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{estimation}} of water-quality parameters from the water-leaving reflectance by means of spectral unmixing. Our starting point is the provision of an analytic model relating the reflectance of water to its masses/bodies or constituents, as specified by their specific inherent optical properties (SIOP) and concentrations. The main objective is to reformulate {{the estimation of}} these concentrations as a spectral unmixing problem. We perform this by employing the linear mixing model (LMM), while suitably defining the endmembers (EMs) as representations of different water types dominated {{by one or more}} constituents. Each EM is then calculated by substituting the in situ-measured SIOP and combinations of utmost concentrations of each constituent into the water-reflectance model. Such use of unmixing practically enables to maintain an implicitly nonlinear relation between the <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> and constituents' concentrations, without resorting to the use of nonlinear mixing models.

40|$|Analysis {{of visible}} remote sensing data {{research}} requires removing atmospheric effects by conversion from radiance to at-surface reflectance. This conversion {{can be achieved}} through theoretical radiative transfer models, which yield good results when well-constrained by field observations, although these measurements are often lacking. Additionally, radiative transfer models often perform poorly in marine or lacustrine settings or when complex air masses with variable aerosols are present. The empirical line method (ELM) measures reference targets of known reflectance in the scene. ELM methods require minimal environmental observations and are conceptually simple. However, calibration coefficients are unique to the image containing the reflectance reference. Here we compare the conversion of hyperspectral radiance observations obtained with the NASA Glenn Research Center Hyperspectral Imager to at-surface reflectance factor using two reflectance reference targets. The first target employs spherical convex mirrors, deployed on the water surface to reflect ambient direct solar and hemispherical sky irradiance to the sensor. We calculate the mirror gain using near concurrent at-sensor reflectance, integrated mirror radiance, and in situ <b>water</b> <b>reflectance.</b> The second target is the Lambertian-like blacktop surface at Maumee Bay State Park, Oregon, OH, where reflectance was measured concurrently by a downward looking, spectroradiometer on the ground, the aerial hyperspectral imager and an upward looking spectroradiometer on the aircraft. These methods allows us to produce an independently calibrated at-surface <b>water</b> <b>reflectance</b> spectrum, when atmospheric conditions are consistent. We compare the mirror and blacktop-corrected spectra to the in situ <b>water</b> <b>reflectance,</b> and find good agreement between methods.

50|$|Numerous {{chlorophyll}} algorithms {{were tested}} {{to see which}} ones best matched chlorophyll globally. Various algorithms perform differently in different environments. Many algorithms estimate chlorophyll concentrations more accurately in deep clear water than in shallow water. In shallow <b>waters</b> <b>reflectance</b> from other pigments, detritus, and the ocean bottom may cause inaccuracies. The stated goals of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll estimates are “… to produce water leaving radiances with an uncertainty of 5% in clear-water regions and chlorophyll a concentrations within ±35% over the range of 0.05-50 mg m-3.”. When accuracy is assessed on a global scale, and all observations are grouped together, then this goal is clearly met. Many satellite estimates range from one-third to three times of those directly recorded at sea, though the overall relationship is still quite good. Differences arise when examined by region, though overall the values are still very useful. One pixel may not be particularly accurate, though when averages are taken over larger areas, the values average out and provide a useful and accurate view of the larger patterns. The benefits of chlorophyll data from satellites far outweigh any flaws in their accuracy simply by the spatial and temporal coverage possible.

First, the model formulation is given focusing on the model input used to specify the SPF. Second, the radiative transfer simulations made to produce the remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) data for the model are described. Third, using the model based on simulation data, the Rrs variability due to the phase function parameters is analysed. Fourth, the model errors are estimated using a different simulated Rrs dataset generated with realistic IOPs. Finally, in the context of practical application to satellite data processing, some remarks on an iterative approach are provided...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} difficulties in modeling cloud fields is the large variability of cloud optical properties (liquid <b>water</b> content, <b>reflectance,</b> emissivity). The stratocumulus and cirrus clouds, under special consideration for FIRE, exhibit spatial variability on scales of 1 km or less. While it is impractical to model individual cloud elements, the research direction is to model a statistical ensembles of cloud elements with mean-cloud properties specified. The major areas of this investigation are: (1) analysis of cloud field properties; (2) intercomparison of cloud radiative model results with satellite observations; (3) radiative parameterization of cloud fields; and (4) development of improved cloud classification algorithms...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{potential}} of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) to describe variations of optically active substances over Alqueva artificial lake is investigated. Limnological laboratory analyses of the water samples collected monthly, from 2003 to 2006, are used in combination with MERIS. The <b>water</b> surface spectral <b>reflectance</b> is derived from Level 1 b MERIS data, using radiative transfer calculations {{to account for the}} atmospheric effects. The lake <b>water</b> spectral surface <b>reflectance</b> is combined with laboratory analyses of cyanobacteria total densities as well as chlorophyll a concentrations and empirical algorithms for both quantities are derived. The results obtained are compared with independent laboratory analyses from 2007, with good correlation coefficients obtained both for cyanobacteria (R ¼ 0. 93) and chlorophyll a (R ¼ 0. 80). The methodology proposed here has been developed to inexpensively monitor Alqueva Reservoir water quality in terms of cyanobacteria and chlorophyll a on a regular basis, and to provide useful information to the authorities...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Earth Resources Spectral Information System and the {{information}} contained therein are described. It contains an ordered, indexed compilation of natural targets in the optical region from 0. 3 to 45. 0 microns. The data compilation includes approximately 100 rock and mineral, 2600 vegetation, 1000 soil, and 60 <b>water</b> spectral <b>reflectance,</b> transmittance, and emittance curves. Most of the data have been categorized by subject, and the curves in those subject areas have been plotted on a single graph. Those categories with too few curves and miscellaneous categories have been plotted as single-curve graphs. Each graph, composite of single, is fully titled to indicate curve source and is indexed by subject to facilitate user retrieval...|$|R
