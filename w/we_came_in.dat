Walsh described the initial stage of production as [...] "a very busy period for all of us ... <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> at about 8:30 in the morning and didn't leave until midnight some days. But it all zipped by pretty quickly." [...] He said that they [...] "felt pretty lucky because usually executives involved with productions look at the stop-motion process as annoying, but on this special, they were very jazzed and gung-go about it." [...] To keep the production crew in the Christmas spirit, six months worth of Christmas music was played, which included 83 versions of [...] According to Finnegan, it took about five months to shoot.|$|E

Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E

500|$|Though the coinage of {{the phrase}} [...] "punk rock" [...] is unknown, Dave Marsh was the first music critic {{to use it in}} print, when in the May 1971 issue of Creem he {{described}} ?and the Mysterians as a [...] "landmark exposition of punk rock". [...] Much of the revival of interest in 1960s garage rock {{can be traced to the}} release of the 1972 album [...] compiled by rock journalist and future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye. In the liner notes, Kaye used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to describe 1960s garage bands and also [...] "garage-punk" [...] in reference to a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight. [...] In the January 1973 Rolling Stone review of Nuggets, Greg Shaw commented [...] "Punk rock is a fascinating genre... Punk rock at its best is the closest <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of rock & [...] roll." [...] In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine, which pre-dated the better-known 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E

2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. <b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
