2500|$|Before {{embarking on}} his {{political}} career, {{he was a}} City entrepreneur. He told The Independent in 2008: [...] "I don't claim that I'm in other than a very happy position compared with most people, because, having spent {{a bit of time}} in the City before I was elected, being able to make a bit of money <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> I have a cushion." [...] He started a company called Sovereign Ratings IBCA in 1994 that tried to [...] "scientifically measure the risks of investing in different countries". In 1997 he became managing director of Fitch IBCA, and from 1999 to 2003 was vice-chairman of Fitch Ratings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ryder," [...] {{he began}} quite {{abruptly}} at last, [...] "had the hall porter of that confounded club {{up to his}} room <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and questioned him before me." ...|$|E
60|$|FAG Sir, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> Sir Anthony came in: I {{told him}} you had sent me to inquire after his health, and {{to know if he}} was at leisure to see you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, [...] "that {{that man}} must have one. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> safe <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there,</b> for <b>I</b> have had bolts fitted everywhere, and a {{pane of glass}} in the front door. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always afraid that he may get in <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> away. Look! <b>Is</b> that some one coming out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall come up to-morrow," [...] said he, [...] "to {{visit the}} castle, {{and then we}} will come out here, and have a picnic, on one of these stone seats. After that I will find a place among the rocks to read or write, for an hour, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there</b> you may climb about among the rocks and precipices as much as you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting <b>there,</b> {{down through}} the blazing {{sunshine}} in his clean, white clothes comes Maximilian Jones, an American interested in rubber and rosewood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I used to {{take your}} books there, afternoons to--to--be with you," [...] she whispered, [...] "and Paw gave orders {{that no one was}} to come nigh it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> Come to-morrow, just before sundown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I {{know her}} voice well. She {{is the woman}} in whose company I {{went out to the}} Colony, and whom I knew <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> It is not {{necessary}} that I should see her. What does she say?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{all right}} about Maria; {{something}} did happen in Edinburgh <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> That very morning I met you one of my oldest clients died quite suddenly at his house at Queensferry, {{only a few miles}} outside the city." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> away <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a tragedy}} in our town. A stranger, {{stopping}} {{over on his}} way East from California; was stabbed to death in an unseemly brawl.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} seeing any very handsome girls <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> some pretty girls {{up at the}} Glen, but I hardly think they could be called beautiful." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{hastened to}} the gun pointed out, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} <b>there</b> waiting for orders, I looked over the side, and, for the first time, {{became aware of the}} cause of these proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a charming}} old town!" [...] the German tourist would exclaim. [...] "I wish I {{could have found}} time <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to have gone outside the hotel and have had a look round. Still, it is {{pleasant}} to think one has been there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Dombey. He passed twice {{through the}} Counting House <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I {{had been able}} to avoid him before, but of course could not hope to do that long. I know how natural it was that he should regard my {{presence}} as something offensive; I felt it must be so, myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'One of the gentlemen, {{the one who}} didn't speak <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> {{looked hard}} at me. And I was afraid he might know what my face meant. But there! Don't mind me, Charley! I was all in a tremble of another sort when you owned to father you could write a little.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, Roger, you and Kate {{must take}} good care of things <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> several hundred dollars locked up in my desk. I would take the money to the bank in Newville, only I hate to lose the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I got to {{the gate}} an’ opened it <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nobody there," [...] {{continued}} the watchman, impressively, [...] "and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standing <b>there</b> <b>I</b> saw the bell-pull go up an’ down without ’ands and the bell rung agin three times." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{very ill}} and {{was ordered to}} Buxton for a month, with strict {{injunctions}} to do nothing whatever all the <b>while</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> [...] "Rest <b>is</b> what you require," [...] said the doctor, [...] "perfect rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I like America very much, {{and that}} means, of course, that I like Americans, {{for a country}} is only what its people make it. I met some very {{delightful}} people <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I recall one family from your own city, Miss Strong, whom I liked particularly--Professor Porter and his daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next two}} days passed serenely and quietly at Reverie's. We read together, rode, walked, and talked together, and listened in the evening to music. For a sister of Reverie's lived not far distant, who visited him <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> and took supper with us, delighting us with her wit and spirit and her {{youthful}} voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your servant," [...] {{said the}} man with the scar, bowing. [...] "Funny case, wasn't it? Here was me, making a little fortune on that island, doing nothing for it neither, and them quite unable to give me notice. It often used to amuse me {{thinking}} over it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I did calculations of it--big--all over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{need any}} spurring {{to make me}} go down again, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all on fire {{to know what was}} on board the other ship, which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure was English, having had a good {{opportunity}} of looking at it <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> down <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{as though}} by {{eliciting}} the good fortunes {{of his brothers}} I had cast some slur upon himself, he said suddenly: [...] "If the railway had come, as it ought to have, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> should have done quite well with my fruit farm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Given away, eh?" [...] the {{newcomer}} groaned, as he kissed Letitia's fingers. [...] "How are you, Mr. Thain? Your country is entirely {{to blame for}} my habits. I got so {{into the habit of}} drinking cocktails <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over <b>there</b> that <b>I</b> really prefer my aperitif to my wine at dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|That we {{may have}} no partial {{evidence}} from abolitionists in this inquiry, either, I will once more turn to their own newspapers, and I will confine myself, this time, to a selection from paragraphs which appeared from day to day, during my visit to America, and which refer to occurrences happening <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> The italics in these extracts, as in the foregoing, are my own.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{does and}} she doesn't. As a sweet, nice child she shrinks from it; {{but as a}} 'psychic,' as they call her, she has no choice. These inner forces seem able to take her by the throat any minute. They seized her <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> Morton, she {{impersonated}} Aunt Dosia, and delivered the most vindictive message--she scared me blue. You never saw anything more dramatic--more awful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Three or four {{of these}} vessels called at Mota <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> On one day three were in sight. They {{told me they were}} shot at at Whitsuntide, Sta. Maria, Vanua Lava, &c. And, indeed, I am obliged to be very careful, more so than at any time; and here, in the North Hebrides, I never know what may happen, though of course in many places they know me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was over}} to Auburn {{yesterday}} -- {{had to go}} to see about a mortgage on our farm -- and I stopped into one of them pawnbrokin' shops to buy a shot-gun, if I could git one cheap. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in <b>there</b> a big boy came in and pawned a gold watch an' two shirt studs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{have time}} to eat much <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the Smiling Pool," [...] he explained. [...] "Couldn't eat and sing too, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> down <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed}} to sing. Now {{that it is time}} to quit singing, I begin to realize that I've got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice. See that bug over there on that leaf? Watch him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir; then I will go off. But {{remember}} this, Herbert Fitzgerald, {{you shall}} live to rue {{the day when}} you treated me with such insolence. And remember this also, Clara Desmond is not your wife as yet. Everything now seems happy with you, and fortunate; you have wealth and a fine house, and a family round you, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there</b> all alone, left like a dog, {{as far as my}} own relatives are concerned. But yet it may come to pass that the Earl of Desmond's daughter will prefer my hand to yours, and my house to your house. They who mount high may chance to get a fall." [...] And then, having uttered this caution, he turned to his mare, and putting his hand upon the saddle, jumped into his seat, and pressing her into a gallop, darted off across the grass.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took one}} look at that memento, and then I went to my room and packed my trunk. I threw a few things into my grip, gave my hair a flirt or two with a side-comb, put on my hat, and went in and gave the old lady's foot a kick. I'd tried awfully hard to use proper and correct {{language}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for Arthur's sake, and I had the habit down pat, but it left me then.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 85: I ought {{perhaps to}} confess that I have a bias {{in favour of}} the Far Eastern Republic, owing to my {{friendship}} for their diplomatic mission which was in Peking <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I never met a more high-minded set of men in any country. And although they were communists, and knew the views that I had expressed on Russia, they showed me great kindness. I do not think, however, that these courtesies have affected my view of the dispute between Chita and Tokyo.] ...|$|E
60|$|Our dinner-hour {{was twelve}} o'clock, and Hendry, for a not incomprehensible reason, called this meal his brose. Frequently, however, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{to share the}} expense, broth {{was put on the}} table, with beef to follow in clean plates, much to Hendry's distress, for the {{comfortable}} and usual practice was to eat the beef from the broth-plates. Jess, however, having three whole white plates and two cracked ones, insisted on the meals being taken genteelly, and her husband, with a look at me, gave way.|$|E
60|$|<b>While</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{knock at}} the door. I went downstairs at once, and {{admitted}} (to my great relief) the Inspector, accompanied by one of our men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} what it <b>is</b> <b>I</b> lack?" [...] he {{answered}} suddenly. [...] "Incentive. I think my will has suddenly grown flabby, the ego in me unresponsive. You know the moods in which one asks oneself whether it is worth while, whether anything <b>is</b> worth <b>while.</b> Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there</b> at the crossroads. I think I feel more inclined to look for a seat than to go on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But these darned boots {{hurt like}} pizen," [...] said the girl, limping. [...] "They {{swallowed}} a lot o' {{water over the}} tops <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wadin' down <b>there,</b> and my feet go swashin' around like in a churn every step." ...|$|R
