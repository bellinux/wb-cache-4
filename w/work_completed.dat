5|$|His {{place in}} Roman history is {{therefore}} summarized as a necessary, if tumultuous stop-gap before the Trajanic-Antonine dynasties. Even {{the only major}} public <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> during his reign, the Forum of Nerva, ultimately {{became known as the}} Forum Transitorium, or transitional forum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s {{several other}} {{improvement}} projects were planned across {{the length of}} the highway, including between Bedfordale and North Bannister, through Mount Barker, and between Narrikup and Albany. Closer to Perth, the section along Bedfordale Hill (south-east of Armadale) was upgraded to a four-lane dual carriageway, with <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> in June 1999.|$|E
5|$|It was {{restored}} to working order in 1979, winning a conservation award in 1982. The mill is still used to grind wheat flour.

Further restoration <b>work,</b> <b>completed</b> in 2007, was funded by the Exmoor Sustainable Development Fund.|$|E

5|$|An Old Church Slavonic {{compilation}} of Lives of saints preserved an eyewitness account on the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896. The first Life of Saint Naum, written around 924, contains nearly contemporary {{information on the}} fall of Moravia caused by Hungarian invasions, although its earliest extant copy is from the 15th century. Similarly late manuscripts (the oldest of which {{was written in the}} 14th century) offer the text of the Russian Primary Chronicle, a historical <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> in 1113. It provides information based on earlier Byzantine and Moravian sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, {{the work was}} {{temporarily}} withdrawn from display to undergo significant conservation <b>work.</b> <b>Completed</b> in October 2009, the restoration {{was followed by the}} work's relocation in 2010 to the entrance area of the new gallery building, where it is intended to be the first work seen by visitors to the gallery.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the canal}} company asked the {{engineer}} James Green to advise on further extensions to the system. His first report {{was critical of}} much of the <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> by Pinkerton, and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour. This would require a lock at Ty Mawr, with water supplied by the Dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the Dyvatty valley. A second report, supplied three months later, recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley, and the construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr. Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 John Scott {{decided to}} sell the island and castle; the local mayor, Alfred Barrow, intervened and the {{following}} the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a memorial {{to those who had}} lost their life in World War I. The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by English Heritage, who operate the site as a tourist attraction. An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University; the findings of the survey led to a program of restoration <b>work,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1991. It is protected by law as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Louisiana {{primarily}} operated {{along the}} east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career. In 190809, she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. A pair of trips to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911. From 1913, she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution, as the US Navy began to send ships to protect American interests in the country. This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. During World War I, Louisiana was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918. After the war ended that year, she was used to ferry American soldiers back from France. With this <b>work</b> <b>completed,</b> she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{refurbished}} {{with funding from}} the Heritage Lottery Fund in April 2007 with the <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> in June the following year. This included the renovation of the Grade II listed Manor Farm library {{as part of a}} borough-wide programme by the London Borough of Hillingdon. The Duck Pond Market began in the Great Barn in December 2008, following the refurbishment, and runs twice a month. Winston Churchill Theatre, not included in the original restoration work, received a £370,000 grant from Hillingdon Council in March 2011 to enable its refurbishment. The other buildings on the site are used as an Exhibition venue (the Cow Byre Gallery), community spaces (The Stables and the Manor Farm Community Hut) and as a small interpretation centre and base of the Hillingdon Music Service (Manor Farm House).|$|E

5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first {{took place in}} 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images. Some in the art world consider Warhol's <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> after his 1968 shooting—which occurred the day before the Bobby Kennedy assassination— to be less significant than that done before it.|$|E
5|$|Kaganovich {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair of the s. She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 7 May 1944 and was officially accepted into the Pacific Fleet on 6 December 1944 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. She was still incomplete on this date and the official report of all <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> was not signed until 29 January 1947. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans in September 1941 and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad before it was destroyed by the Germans in 1942. Another problem was the collapse of nine girders supporting the roof of Dock 8 onto the ship in early December 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{first public}} {{announcement}} of the cancellation of the Paramount Television Service and Phase II came {{at the hands of}} the gossip columnist Rona Barrett at the start of December. In response, Paramount released a statement that said the new network had been pushed back to the fall of 1978, and that Phase II had its episode order increased from 13 to between 15 and 22. Despite this, behind the scenes, production continued on Star Trek as a film, not as a series. One of the changes around the same time as Barrett's reports was the realization that all the model <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> thus far had to be restarted from scratch, as it was not detailed enough to be blown up on a motion picture-sized screen. Two further changes took place in December: Collins was dropped as director, for Paramount wanted a motion picture director and not one with experience only in television; and Livingston allowed his contract to run out and left the production, owing to the poor relationship he had with Roddenberry. By January, Paramount no longer pretended that Star Trek was to be anything other than a feature film. Livingston was brought back, but only in a writing capacity, and Robert Wise was hired as director on the film to replace Collins.|$|E

5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche {{if he could get}} the opticals <b>work</b> <b>completed</b> by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E
