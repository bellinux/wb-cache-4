The size of the free volume elements declined initially, followed by an increasing trend at vapor partial pressures greater than 2. 5 kPa, indicating polymer swelling.

When the experimental temperature reached the soft segment crystal temperature of SMPU, an abrupt change of <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>permeability</b> of SMPU coated fabrics were observed.

An attempt {{has been made to}} experimentally observe the effect of cell shape on heat and mass transfer characteristics of cellular foams. The foam samples used in this study were derived from elastomeric foam The thermal conductivity and <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> transmission data were taken on foams with three different cell shapes. one having spherical cells and two having elliptical cells, with varied degree of elon-gation. The thermal conductivity measurements on the samples described above were ob-tained using Thin-Heater thermal conductivity apparatus, otherwise known as the ASTM C- 1114 test. The thermal measurements were performed in the temperature range of 35 to 153 &deg;F. The experimental data indicated no significant effect of the cell elongation on thermal conductivity of foam. This could be attributed to the follow-ing: a) the densities of the foam were roughly the same, and therefore conduction heat transfer was not significantly changed; b) the possible decrease in the radiation component of thermal conductivity because of elongated cells was nullified by the increase in transmission of heat attributable to relatively thinner walls resulting from the stretching of the foams during sample preparation. Additionally, the change in the shape of cells could have changed the radiation heat transfer characteristic of the samples. <b>Water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the foams with elongated cells were measured with Permatran&reg; and compared to that of the foam with uniform cells.

The addition of cellulose fibers and nanoclay increased the tensile strength of the films 8. 5 times and the Young modulus 24 times but reduced the elongation capacity 14 times. The water barrier properties of the composite-films to which bentonite and cellulose fibers were added were approximately 60 % inferior to those of starch films.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{fabricated}} three-layer films, comprising a varying {{content of}} ethylene–vinyl alcohol copoly-mer (EVOH) as the internal layer and blends of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and low-density ethylene grafted with maleic anhydride (LDPE-g-MAH) as the external layers, by a coextrusion blown-film process. We {{chose to use}} blends to promote the adhesion between EVOH and LDPE and {{to reduce the number}} of layers in the coextrusion system. The peel strength increased sharply when the amount of LDPE-g-MAH was greater than 12. 5 wt % and we associate it with the promotion of adhesion between layers brought about by specific interactions between EVOH and LDPE-g-MAH. FT-IR spectroscopic analysis showed an increase in the intensity of the absorbance of the ester band upon increasing the content of LDPE-g-MAH, which indicates that a chemical reaction occurs that promotes adhesion at the interface. The tensile strength did not change significantly with increasing LDPE-g-MAH content, which had a small effect on elongation and modulus in both the machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD). Tear strength decreased continuously with in-creasing LDPE-g-MAH content, in both the MD and TD, as a result of the greater ease of crack propagation in the EVOH layer. The oxygen permeability of the three-layer films remained almost constant upon varying the amount of LDPE-g-MAH. These three-layer films all followed the theoretical prediction made by the inverse additivity rule. The <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the three-layer films, however, were affected by the degree of hydrogen bonding, which was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy.

Zunächst werden die verschiedenen gesputterten Oxidschichten charakterisiert und verglichen. Die untersuchten Materialien sind Zinkoxid, Siliziumoxid, Zink-Zinn-Oxid, Aluminiumoxid und Titanoxid. Die wirkenden Permeationsmechanismen und die Ursachen für teils deutliche Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Materialien werden diskutiert.

Am Beispiel des Zink-Zinn-Oxids und des Aluminiumoxids wird anschließend die Abhängigkeit der Permeationseigenschaften von wesentlichen Prozessparametern wie Sputterleistung, Prozessdruck oder reaktiver Arbeitspunkt untersucht. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit werden die Plasmapolymerschichten hinsichtlich ihrer Struktur- und Permeationseigenschaften charakterisiert und mit gesputtertem Siliziumoxid verglichen. Die Abhängigkeit der Permeationseigenschaften vom Kohlenstoffgehalt in den Schichten wird untersucht. Anhand der gewonnenen Ergebnisse werden abschließend sowohl die Sputterschichten als auch die mittels Magnetron-PECVD abgeschiedenen Schichten hinsichtlich ihrer Eignung für ein Barrieremehrfachschichtsystem bewertet. The {{aim of this}} PhD-thesis is to {{evaluate}} a concept for a multilayer permeation barrier by a detailed characterization of the different constituent of the layer stack. The multilayer concept is based on reactively sputtered permeation barrier layers and an interlayer that is deposited by using a magnetron based plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (Magnetron-PECVD) process. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, different sputtered oxide layers are characterized and compared regarding their structural and surface properties as well as their <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and oxygen <b>permeability.</b> These oxide layers include the materials zinc oxide, silicon oxide, zinc-tin oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. The permeation mechanisms and reasons for significant differences in the <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and oxygen transmission rates in the different materials are evaluated and discussed. Oxygen permeation thereby is always dominated by defects in the layers. In contrast to that, additional permeation mechanisms can be assumed for <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> permeation. The dependence of the gas permeation on sputter process parameters like plasma power, process pressure and reactive sputtering mode is evaluated for zinc-tin oxide and aluminum oxide layers. In the second part of this thesis, plasma polymer layers that are deposited using the Magnetron-PECVD process are characterized regarding their structure and surface roughness. Their <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and oxygen <b>permeability</b> is compared to the permeation through reactively sputtered silicon oxide layers. The dependence of the gas permeation on the atomic composition, in particular on the carbon concentration, is evaluated. Finally, both the sputtered oxide layers and the Magnetron-PECVD plasma polymer layers are evaluated regarding their usability in a multilayer stack for high permeation barrier applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of biopolymers for packaging application is often limited {{due to their}} poor processability. In this study, the effect of commonly used plasticizers on the properties of different cast biopolymer films is investigated. This enables a valuation of the {{potential of}} different biopolymers as packaging materials and an estimation {{of the effectiveness of}} plasticizers for certain biopolymer systems. Polysaccharides (corn starch and alginate) and plant proteins (wheat gluten and pea protein) were tested as film materials. To improve the processability by decreasing the brittleness of these cast biopolymer films, glycerol (Gly), sorbitol (Sor), and triethanolamine (TEA) were added as plasticizers. The structural, mechanical, and barrier properties to <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and oxygen were characterized in order to study the effectiveness of the plasticizers and their respective influence on the film properties. The mechanical results show there was a plasticizing effect with all the plasticizers, but the influence on the barrier properties depends on the specific plasticizer: While glycerol (Gly) leads to an increase in <b>water</b> <b>vapor</b> and oxygen <b>permeability</b> (OP), Sor leads to almost constant, and TEA even to decreased OP of the biopolymer films. Therefore, careful selection of the plasticizer allows biopolymer films with improved processability and high or low permeabilities to be manufactured...|$|R
