Scholars are fairly sure, based on a few fragments and on references in historic texts, that much lost secular poetry was set to music, and was spread by traveling minstrels, or bards, across Europe.

Of these only books 1-10 and 21-45 have survived down to our times, covering the years from the foundation up to 293 and 220 --- 167 BC.

(Only one was held. A second was unsuccessful because the gallery locked the doors.) Another coalition of artists and critics including Roberta Smith, Laurie Anderson, Rosalind E. Krauss, Craig Owens, Douglas Crimp, and Stephen Koch published an open letter defending the exhibition and criticizing the protestors whom they accused of “exploiting this sensitive issue as a means of attracting attention" [...] and [...] "insensitivity to the complexities of both esthetics and politics." [...] Douglas Crimp told Seven Days [...] "It's damaging to think about the political issues and not the work."

There's an intelligence operating here." [...] "All you moralists" [...] Newman said [...] "it takes an amoral kid like me to make things move." [...] He also said he [...] "never imagined that a segment of the art community would object to it.

British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board.

40|$|Introduction]: A {{few years}} ago, {{my colleagues and}} I {{embarked}} on a journey that had multiple rationales and multiple outcomes. We had all been software developers {{at some point in}} our professional lives and we noticed a growing interest in the software developer community about so-called Agile methods, and eXtreme Programming (XP) in particular. None of us had explicitly applied these methods in the projects in which we had been a part, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> other colleagues who had and still were. As academics, these Agile methods interested us because our developer colleagues were reporting significant benefits of using them. Many of the practices seemed to reflect the way these developers preferred to work and since traditional software development methods had a relatively low adoption rate, perhaps these new methods provided a more relevant approach. We also saw a research opportunity, a gap, with many practitioner reports but little academic research focussing on Agile methods. Another rationale was to build research capacity by mentoring young researchers in designing, conducting and reporting research...|$|R
