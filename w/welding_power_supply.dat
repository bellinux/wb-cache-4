5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{equipment}} typically consists of a constant current <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and an electrode, with an electrode holder, a 'ground' clamp, and welding cables (also known as welding leads) connecting the two.|$|E

50|$|Single or {{multiple}} (2 to 5) electrode wire {{variations of the}} process exist. SAW strip-cladding utilizes a flat strip electrode (e.g. 60 mm wide x 0.5 mm thick). DC or AC power can be used, and combinations of DC and AC are common on multiple electrode systems. Constant voltage <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> are most commonly used; however, constant current systems in combination with a voltage sensing wire-feeder are available.|$|R
5000|$|Resistance <b>welding</b> - <b>Power</b> <b>supplies</b> (linear DC, {{high and}} mid {{frequency}} inverters, capacitive discharge, AC weld controls), weld monitors and checkers, displacement monitors, weld heads (manual and air actuated, servo-motor controlled, electromagnetic), accessories and consumables.|$|R
5|$|These {{processes}} use a <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{to create}} and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|R

500|$|Though SMAW {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} a manual arc welding process, one notable process variation exists, known as gravity welding or gravity arc welding. It {{serves as an}} automated version of the traditional shielded metal arc welding process, employing an electrode holder attached to an inclined bar {{along the length of}} the weld. Once started, the process continues until the electrode is spent, allowing the operator to manage multiple gravity welding systems. The electrodes employed (often E6027 or E7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically [...] in length and about [...] thick. As in manual SMAW, a constant current <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is used, with either negative polarity direct current or alternating current. Due to a rise in the use of semiautomatic welding processes such as flux-cored arc welding, the popularity of gravity welding has fallen as its economic advantage over such methods is often minimal. Other SMAW-related methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker welding, an automatic method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive electrode welding, a process for welding large components or structures that can deposit up to [...] of weld metal per hour.|$|E
2500|$|Arc welding is {{a process}} that is used to join metal to metal by using {{electricity}} to create enough heat to melt metal, and the melted metals when cool result in a binding of the metals.

40|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, Resistance Spot Welding (RSW) {{is widely used}} for its low cost, high speed, simple mechanism and applicability for automation. RSW has become the predominant means of auto body assembly, resulting in two to six thousands spot welds performed on each manufactured car. In the North American automobile industry there are approximately 100 billion spot welds, which are done every year. RSW is the joining {{of two or more}} metal parts together in a localized area by resistive heating and pressure. Small Scale RSW (SSRSW) is commonly used for medical devices and electronic components, because the welded parts are thinner and smaller compared to common RSW applications, such as automotive applications. According to a study of Edison Welding Institute, 20 % of the welding quality issues are the <b>weld</b> schedule or <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> related. Therefore, to contribute to weld quality improvement, the study of different <b>weld</b> schedules or <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and control schemes needs to be improved by doing further studies in this area. Thus a novel <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> which can provide a testing bench for these studies, was designed and developed in 2005 by L. J. Brown and J. Lin. This research study will focus on studying and improving <b>weld</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> <b>weld</b> schedules and control modes. One of the goals for this research is to improve the consistency of weld nugget size and strength by using different control parameters, which will be weighted geometric averages of voltage and current. These control parameters are fed back to a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller that is designed to control the Direct Current (DC) <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for the RSW {{to come up with the}} best control parameters that will improve the consistency of the RSW spot welds. Another goal for this research is it to further develop the existing DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that was designed for SSRSW by L. J. Brown, to include tip voltage measurements, and Large Scale Resistance Spot Welding (LSRSW). This goal will lead to build additional weld modules to construct a 6000 A welder in the future...|$|R
50|$|<b>Welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> {{may also}} use {{generators}} or alternators to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Modern designs are usually {{driven by an}} internal combustion engine but older machines may use an electric motor to drive an alternator or generator. In this configuration the utility power is converted first into mechanical energy then back into electrical energy to achieve the step-down effect similar to a transformer. Because {{the output of the}} generator can be direct current, or even a higher frequency AC, these older machines can produce DC from AC without any need for rectifiers of any type, or can also be used for implementing formerly-used variations on so-called heliarc (most often now called TIG) welders, where the need for a higher frequency add-on module box is avoided by the alternator simply producing higher frequency ac current directly.|$|R

50|$|Additional {{types of}} welders also exist, besides the types using transformers, motor/generator, and inverters. For example, laser welders also exist, and they require an entirely {{different}} type of <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> design that does not fall {{into any of the}} types of welding power supplies discussed previously. Likewise, spot welders require a different type of <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> typically containing elaborate timing circuits and large capacitor banks that are not commonly found with any other types of welding power supplies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is {{a device}} that {{provides}} an electric current to perform welding. Welding usually requires high current (over 80 amperes) and it can need above 12,000 amperes in spot welding. Low current can also be used; welding two razor blades together at 5 amps with {{gas tungsten arc welding}} is a good example. A <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{can be as simple as}} a car battery and as sophisticated as a high-frequency inverter using IGBT technology, with computer control to assist in the welding process.|$|E
5|$|To <b>supply</b> the {{electrical}} <b>power</b> necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> can be used. The most common <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> are constant current <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> and constant voltage <b>power</b> <b>supplies.</b> In arc <b>welding,</b> the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|R

40|$|Although many {{methods are}} {{available}} for production of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), the conventional carbon arc process remains the most popular due to its simplicity and large production rate. However, high temperatures inside the carbon arc generate strong buoyancy driven convection, and it is hypothesized that the non-uniform environment created by this flow will have large effects on the growth and morphology of SWNTs produced by the arc process. Indeed, using normal gravity experiments, Marin et al. have demonstrated that changes in the buoyant convection plume produced by altering the arc electrode orientation {{can be used to}} change the diameter distribution of the SWNTs produced; an effect they attribute to changes in the temperature of the local nanotube growth environment. While these experiments present convincing evidence that buoyant convection has a strong effect on nanotube growth, normal gravity experiments are severely limited in scope. The ideal way to study the effect of buoyancy on SWNT production is to remove it completely. Toward this goal, a microgravity carbon arc reactor has been designed for use in the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers. Although simple in principle, conventional carbon arc machines, which generally employ large reaction chambers and require heavy duty <b>welding</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> capable of <b>supplying</b> kilowatts of <b>power,</b> are not suitable for microgravity experiments. Here we describe a miniature carbon arc machine for SWNT production that fits into a conventional drop rig for use on the NASA Glenn 2. 2 and 5 second drop towers, but that has a performance (production rate) that is better than most large ground-based machines...|$|R

40|$|Micro {{resistance}} welding {{is one of}} the most effective ways to obtain permanent joints of metal parts. The quality of welded joints strongly depends on the characteristics of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> of <b>welding</b> equipment.
