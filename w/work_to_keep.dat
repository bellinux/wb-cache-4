25|$|In 2014, the NBA Board of Governors {{voted on}} a {{proposed}} reform to the lottery. If {{the proposed changes}} passed, the four worst {{teams in the league}} would have been given identical odds (around 11 percent) at winning the top pick. The fifth team would have a 10 percent chance and the odds would decrease for each team picking after. The proposed changes would take away the advantage of having the worst record in the league (currently the worst team is given a 25% chance at the pick), and would <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> teams competitive throughout the entire season.|$|E
25|$|Growing up in Galveston, Texas, Johnson {{attended}} {{five years}} of school and {{was known as a}} bright, talkative, and energetic kid. Like all of his siblings, Jack was expected to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the family going while he was growing up. He helped sweep classrooms to ease the work for his father, and he worked for the local milkman before school, taking care of the horses while the milkman got off to make deliveries. For this work he was paid 10 cents and a red pair of socks, which his boss had a seemingly endless supply of, every Saturday.|$|E
25|$|Unstable {{colloidal}} suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual {{clusters of}} particles {{fall to the}} bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the Brownian forces that <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as bentonite and toothpaste, flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.|$|E

25|$|After {{appearing}} on The Real World, Winick {{and his former}} costar, Pam Ling, began to date. Winick proposed to her with a cartoon he made for the occasion, and which he presented to her while wearing a gorilla suit. The cartoon presented Ling with two choices to answer his proposal. After she accepted his proposal, he summoned three singing Elvises. Winick and Ling married in a civil ceremony on August 26, 2001. Writer Armistead Maupin spoke at their ceremony. As of 2008, they have two children, {{a son and a}} daughter, whom they <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> out of the spotlight, preferring to omit photos of them from social media, and publications who interview the couple to omit their names.|$|E
25|$|Authorities on {{each side}} <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly {{involves}} drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional newspaper headlines, occasional violent crime and religious articles geared {{to those in the}} trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and Douglas, AZ was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three corridos have been written about this tunnel.|$|E

By 1991, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy filed an appeal with the 4th District Court of Appeals after losing the lawsuit {{to the city of}} San Diego and Caltrans. The Sierra Club had also sued the California Coastal Commission. On July 16, 1992, the Sierra Club withdrew its lawsuit after the City of San Diego agreed to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Peñasquitos Lagoon flowing to the ocean and to restore a wetland area. Following the Sierra Club's settlement, the City of Del Mar raised an {{objection}} to the club's decision to accept a settlement, since the city had given a $7,000 contribution (about $ in [...] dollars) to the case.

500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time—the passion is only for something that you don't have. You have to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

[...] The strip appeared in a Herald subsidiary, the Evening Telegram, and the Heralds editor required McCay to use a pseudonym for the strip <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it separate from his other work.

500|$|By April 1983, track {{deformation}} was {{a serious}} issue. On April 13, the division track master flew to Denver to explain the situation at a specially-called staff meeting. [...] On the same day, a Utah Highway Patrol officer struck a newly created buckle in the highway that threw him against {{the roof of his}} vehicle. By the end of the day, a full maintenance crew was struggling to keep US-6 open. All trains were limited to speeds less than , and were accompanied by maintenance personnel who had to continually <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the tracks in line. The last train to pass through downtown Thistle was the westbound Rio Grande Zephyr, on April 14, 1983 at about 8:30p.m. That night, both US-6 and the rail line were closed. One westbound freight train that had already left Denver was turned back. All through trains between Denver and Salt Lake City were rerouted to Union Pacific Railroad's Overland Route through Wyoming. By April 16, the tracks were completely buried and a voluntary evacuation order was issued for the town.|$|E

500|$|The next stage, {{after the}} first rest day, was the longest in the Vuelta and {{contained}} numerous mountain climbs. It was made even more difficult by a consistent downfall of rain and cold temperatures. Contador and Leipheimer both marked the competition and finished well on the stage, third and fifth respectively, to maintain their high overall placings. Leipheimer regained the race lead the next day essentially by default, as Alessandro Ballan, who had won the difficult Stage 7, quickly faded on Stage 8. Again Astana did not <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Leipheimer in the race lead, affording a breakaway that included Egoi Martínez sufficient time that Martínez took the golden jersey. The next day, several local newspapers criticized Astana for the move, as [...] and [...] had tried to pull the peloton such that Astana would have no choice to defend the jersey, but were unable to force their hand. Martínez reacted to his assumption of the race lead {{as though it were}} a gift from his former manager Bruyneel.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning praised Morris for her {{performance}} in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas", and wrote: [...] "The heart of [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] {{was found in}} Artie Abrams attempt to keep Brittany's belief in Santa Claus alive. Heather Morris perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa. Her interaction with the black mall Santa was a highlight. Watching Artie, and eventually {{the rest of the}} club, <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Brittany's belief intact was truly in the spirit of Christmas and should have been made into a fuller part of the episode. Also shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] In January 2010, Morris and her co-stars won the [...] "Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.

500|$|At the time, Shiller was 30 {{years old}} {{and the editor of}} Keep Strong, a leftist magazine. Shiller's first attempt at elected office was to join a multi-way {{challenge}} to Axelrod. [...] "I ran for alderman of this [...] ward in 1978. I was terrified. I was very shy, afraid to speak to more than five people at a time," [...] Shiller recalled in 2003. Shiller picked up much of the support that Young Lords founder and leader Jose Cha Cha Jimenez had in Jimenez' unsuccessful challenge to Cohen in the 1975 elections. He was running primarily as a defence against the FBI's CointelPro repressive program and to [...] expose the displacement of Latino and lower income areas from the lakefront and near downtown by the Richard J. Daley machine. He still received 39% of the vote coming in second in a three way race. Shiller's base of support was the same geographic center of the ward, an area of high density, low-income families between Broadway and Clark Street. Shiller campaigned pledging to <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the disadvantaged of Uptown from being displaced by gentrification.|$|E

500|$|The UK {{economy was}} {{contracting}} {{by the early}} 1970s, and engineering businesses were rationalising their operations on a scale which raised many comments in Parliament and elsewhere. The ratio of unemployment to vacancies in engineering and the allied trades at June 1970 {{was more or less}} 1:1, but by September 1971 it was 5:1, i.e.: five people unemployed in the sector for every job available. In 1972 the Churchill factory in Altrincham was closed, despite industrial action there and at Alfred Herbert's Coventry factory to stop this happening. There were representations against the closure from Altrincham council to the government, including a meeting in February 1972 when the council and its delegation of industry experts met the Minister for Trade and Industry and said [...] It was said in Parliament that 1,000 people were made redundant and that in Manchester 500 machine tool fitters were now chasing 10 jobs.
