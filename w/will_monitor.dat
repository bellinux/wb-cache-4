25|$|However, {{shortly before}} signing onto the CSM, the second batch of member states (all in the OECS) {{negotiated}} an opt-out agreement {{with regards to}} land ownership by non-nationals.

As it now stands foreign companies or nationals have to seek legal permission to buy land. All other laws relating to discrimination in favour of member state nationals only have been amended though. Among the non-OECS members of the CSM, there are no restrictions on private land ownership by CARICOM nationals (although in Suriname, and possibly in the other members as well, restrictions still apply with regards to state-owned land).|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fire, the synagogue took steps for the possible demolition of the building. The city's Department of Buildings had determined that the remains of the building was unstable, but would not approve an emergency demolition, so a board member filed an application with the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) for a general demolition permit, which did not specify how much of the structure was planned to be razed; that will depend on a determination of [...] "structural findings". [...] The synagogue also provided materials to Community Board 3, with a request that their application be heard by an advisory panel. [...] Prior to the fire, Rabbi Mendel Greenbaum had been in discussion with groups such as the Chinese-American Planning Council and the Gotham Organization about selling the building's air rights in connection with the potential development of a neighboring parcel, {{to help pay for the}} possible renovation and preservation of the synagogue. The LPC responded on July 11 with a permit for removal of unsafe parts of the building, but required that other parts be evaluated for possible preservation. The Commission's engineers <b>will</b> <b>monitor</b> the demolition.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had been}} warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was {{unprepared}} for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find [...] "dirt" [...] on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: [...] "There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. and this country questioning my friends and trying to discredit me." [...] Attempts were made to implicate him {{in the murder of}} a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they would not say who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the Sunday Times that Miller [...] "is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They <b>will</b> <b>monitor</b> where he goes, who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick." ...|$|E
