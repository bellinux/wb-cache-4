6000|$|... "That {{only makes}} it worse, sir--if anything. You {{may depend on}} it she was no good. Those pagan times will never come back, thank God. Ten years of murder and unrighteousness!

6000|$|... "I don't know. But I do know I don't {{want to be}} just stupidly satisfied, {{and talking}} does keep me from that, anyway. See here, Miss Winslow, suppose some time I {{suggested}} that we become nice and earnest and take up socialism and single tax and this--what is it?--oh, syndicalism--and really studied them, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Make each other study?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} they took the coach to Weymouth, the port from which at that time {{communication}} was kept open with France by means of smugglers and men who made a business of aiding the French emigrants who wanted to escape, or the Royalists who went backwards and forwards {{trying to get up}} a movement against the Republic. On making enquiries they heard {{of a man who had}} a very fast little vessel, and they at once looked him up. “This gentleman wants to go across,” Will said. “What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for?” ...|$|E

60|$|To {{ask them}} to examine with a {{microscope}} the character of such a benefactor; to {{ask them to}} examine it at all; {{to ask them to}} look at a blemish which another person believes he has found in it--well, in their place could you do it? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Wouldn't you be ashamed to do it? If a tramp had rescued your child from fire and death, and saved its mother's heart from breaking, could you see his rags? Could you smell his breath? Mrs. Eddy has done more than that for these people.|$|E
60|$|Now, you cannot, indeed, {{have here}} in England, woods {{eighteen}} miles deep to the centre; but you can, perhaps, keep a fairy or two for your children yet, {{if you wish to}} keep them. But DO you wish it? Suppose you had each, at the back of your houses, a garden, large enough for your children to play in, with just as much lawn as would give them room to run,--no more--and that you could not change your abode; but that, if you chose, you could double your income, or quadruple it, by digging a coal shaft {{in the middle of the}} lawn, and turning the flower-beds into heaps of coke. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I hope not. I can tell you, you would be wrong if you did, though it gave you income sixty-fold instead of four-fold.|$|E
6000|$|It is a commonplace, enshrined, if I mistake not, even {{in school}} copy-books, that honour {{is to be}} sought and not fame. I ask no other admission; we are to seek honour, upright walking with our own {{conscience}} every hour of the day, and not fame, the consequence, the far-off reverberation of our footsteps. The walk, not the rumour of the walk, is what concerns righteousness. Better disrespectable honour than dishonourable fame. Better useless or seemingly hurtful honour, than dishonour ruling empires and filling the mouths of thousands. For the man must walk by what he sees, and leave the issue with God who made him and taught him by the fortune of his life. You would not dishonour yourself for money; which is at least tangible; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then, for a doubtful forecast in politics, or another person’s theory in morals? ...|$|E

5000|$|Ayers {{was asked}} in a January 2004 interview, [...] "How {{do you feel about}} what you did? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again under similar circumstances?" [...] He replied: [...] "I've thought about this a lot. Being almost 60, it's {{impossible}} to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things, but the question of did we do something that was horrendous, awful? ... I don't think so. I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Someone {{once said}} ‘Art is an addiction. That's {{why there are}} so many bad artists.’ I think that's true. I can't imagine not liking to write. Why the fuck <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> then? For the {{inevitable}} rejection? Sure you get stuck here and there, but why put yourself through the torture? Isn't there enough in life to make you miserable?“I don't know why I love it. For some reason I'm wired that way. Probably {{it has to do with}} coming from a blue-collar background, where really tedious, boring, unrewarding work was what you had to face every day, day in and day out. Doing anything creative is like traveling to another universe.” ...|$|E
5000|$|For years I {{have been}} asked two questions. (1) <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again? (2) Do you feel any guilt for having {{been a part of}} Hiroshima's destruction?One has to {{consider}} the context of the times in which decisions are made. Given the same set of circumstances as existed in 1945, I would not hesitate to take part in another similar mission.No I feel no sorrow or remorse for whatever small role I played. That I should is crazy. I remember Pearl Harbor and all of the Japanese atrocities. I remember the shock to our nation that all of this brought. I don't want to hear any discussion of morality. War, by its very nature, is immoral. Are you any more dead from an atomic bomb than from a conventional bomb? ...|$|E

5000|$|... —Would {{you do it}} again? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{the same}} way? - Sure, I'd {{do the same and}} more. I wouldn't leave anybody alive (...) That was one of DINA's mistakes. I was always arguing with my general: don't leave that person alive, don't let that person go free. There are consequences. [...] - As for throwingthe corpses of the prisoners into the sea... I think it could have happened. (...) Throwing them into the crater of a volcano would be better... Who'd go looking for them in a volcano? Nobody. - On the day you die... what would your epitaph say? [...] "Here lies the hangman, the torturer, the murderer..." [...] - Logical, logical.

40|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study is}} reported that was {{conducted during the}} late 1930 s in which normally fluent children {{were reported to have}} been turned into stutterers. Theoretic and clinical implications are discussed. The diagnosogenic (semantogenic) theory for the onset of stuttering was initially proposed by Wendell Johnson in the early 1940 s. It suggested that calling attention to a child’s normal hesitations (repetitions) could precipitate stuttering (Bloodstein, 1987). Some of the evidence that John-son used to support this theory (e. g., certain tribes of American Indians, in which there appeared to be no stutterers, had no word for stuttering) is currently regarded as questionable (Bloodstein, 1987). The theory {{does not appear to be}} as widely accepted now as it was during the past 30 years, judging by the fact that many speech pathologists are recom-mending to parents that they make their children aware of their hesitations rather than ignoring them (Bloodstein, 1987).

40|$|Communicating {{science to}} the public takes time away from busy {{research}} ca-reers. So why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> I here offer six reasons. First, we owe that understand-ing {{to the people who}} fund our experi-ments, the taxpaying public. Second, we can leverage our skills as scientists to in-spire critical thinking in public and political dialog. Third, researchers are optimally positioned to stem the flow of scientific misinformation in the media. Fourth, we can explain the ways and the means by which science can (and cannot) improve law and social policy. Fifth, it is incumbent upon us to explain what sci-ence is and is not: while it is away of think-ing that upgrades our intuitions, it also comes with a deep understanding of (and tolerance for) uncertainty. Finally, we find ourselves in the pleasurable position of being able to share the raw beauty of the world around us—and in the case of neu-roscience, the world inside us. I suggest that scientists are optimally stationed to increase their presence in the public sphere: our training positions us to syn-thesize large bodies of data, weigh the ev-idence, and communicate with nuance, sincerity and exactitude...|$|E
40|$|There {{will be a}} {{time when}} your library will need to {{evaluate}} all of your electronic resources. How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> In response to a cut to our materials budget, we have developed a method that condenses a large amount of information into a few select criteria. In this day‐long workshop, we walked through the process using the Decision Grid process developed at the University of Maryland at College Park (Foudy and McManus, p. 533 ‐ 538) as a starting point. The workshop leaders first demonstrated each step of our process, and then the participants worked in small groups (5 ‐ 7) using their own experiences and a sample data set of their own. The steps covered included selecting and defining the criteria, gathering and analyzing the data, and determining how to make final decisions. We covered some technical aspects of gathering and analyzing data, including using Excel functions. We also included discussions about the criteria and ways of eliciting honest and useful feedback from librarians and patrons. The participants received a flash drive with Excel templates that included formulas, as well as completed sheets with sample data, and the presentation files...|$|E
30|$|What {{does the}} term “carrier” refer to here? One of the {{carriers}} {{is the power}} of the provincial government. The Director of the Counsel Management Office said: “The judicial work must be listed in the major planning on economic development by the provincial government, because if you do not put it in, in the future where does your money come from? If you still can’t be put into the major economic and social development planning of the provincial government, the finance bureau will certainly not increase its budget in you. Then this is just like you’re talking to yourself; it doesn’t make much sense” (20130106). The Director of the Legal Aid Office said: “Of our provincial government tax income, the legal profession contributes approximately 700 million, but the government gives us very low budget. If I want to have legal aid services and funding, it is necessary to ask for support from the provincial government and the provincial financial bureau. Otherwise, how <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> How much money a year do your Justice Bureau have? No matter how you cry, if {{there is a lack of}} money, you cannot solve this problem” (20130718). Obviously, all the bureaus want to gain the support from the provincial government. The documents of the provincial education bureau were supported and forwarded by the provincial government; the Bureau of Justice took it as a good example and tried very hard to get a support from the provincial government and have their documents forwarded by the general office of the provincial government.|$|E

5000|$|On September 20, 2010, at a townhall {{discussion}} {{sponsored by}} CNBC, Obama said healthy skepticism about government and spending was good, {{but it was}} not enough to just say [...] "Get control of spending", and he challenged the Tea Party movement to get specific about how they would cut government debt and spending: [...] "And so the challenge, I think, for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It's</b> not enough just to say, get control of spending. I think it's important for you to say, I'm willing to cut veterans' benefits, or I'm willing to cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, or I'm willing to see these taxes go up. What you can't do—which is what I've been hearing a lot from the other side—is say we're going to control government spending, we're going to propose $4 trillion of additional tax cuts, and that magically somehow things are going to work." ...|$|R
