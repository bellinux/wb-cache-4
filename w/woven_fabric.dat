25|$|While huipils {{today are}} made from {{commercial}} cloth, the most traditional {{are made from}} hand <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> made on a backstrap loom. The pieces {{to be used to}} make the huipil are woven to size and are never cut. Despite its simplicity, the backstrap loom permits more types of techniques and designs to be woven into the cloth than other types of looms. Most of the hand <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> have designs woven into them, especially cloth destined for ceremonial huipils. The decorative elements can signify history, cultural identity, something personal about the wearer and more. Since most indigenous come from agricultural societies, clothing designs generally relate to the natural world. The most complicated designs are generally known only to a few older master weavers. In addition to designs embedded into the fabric, other decorative elements can include embroidery, ribbon, feathers, lace and more.|$|E
25|$|Woven wraps are {{pieces of}} <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton {{being the most}} common, but hemp, linen, silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are {{homespun}} or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.|$|E
40|$|Development of the {{wrinkled}} fabrics {{depends on}} geometry and relaxation {{behavior of the}} multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> After bleaching and relaxation, the new shapes and sizes of crinkles were recorded. The results prove that the manner of fabric deformation during relaxation depends upon the multilayer fabrics structure. The quantities of the crinkles on the fabric {{are related to the}} float length type. Multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with longer float length show higher crinkled, and its deformation behavior is non-linear. Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> draping and fitting of the garment. For this purpose, we have postulated new model for the relationship between fabric geometry and stretch potential. The suggested hypotheses make it possible to predict mathematically the crinkle of multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> and prediction of suitable-sett of warp and weft. The area covering value was chosen as suitable model for description of multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> structure. The study was divided into two parts, the first presents the relationship between fabric geometry of the relaxation behavior whereas the second investigated the influence of multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> stretch potential on the relaxation ability of bleached fabric. Three variants of cumulative parameter of a crinkle <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> structure were introduced. The realistic models based on a better approach of geometry and material properties will be created in order to investigate the numerical analysis performance of the mechanical properties of crinkle <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> A correlation between calculated values of structural parameters crinkle multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> values was evaluated...|$|R

30|$|Very few {{researchers}} {{have come forward}} and carried out research using <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{in the case of}} cut resistant fabrics specifically, {{despite the fact that they}} possess superior mechanical properties in both in-plane and transverse directions compared to knitted fabrics. It has been reported that <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on high strength and high modulus fibers with dense structures have the advantage of shear resistance (Tien et al. 2010). Also due to interlacement of tows or yarns, <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> offer high resistance to damage, superior energy absorption (Karahan et al. 2008) and remarkably high values of strain at failure in tension, and loadings (Chou and Ko 1989; Dixit and Mali 2013). With the rapid advancement in the field of textiles, <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> can be fabricated to near knit shape, which could exhibit high degree of flexibility. Therefore, in the present study the comparison of cut resistance behavior of high performance knitted and <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> are analyzed. 100 % Kevlar, 100 % PE and 50 % PE/ 50 % Kevlar composite knitted and <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> were produced on electronic flat knitting machine and shuttle loom, respectively and the cut resistance behavior is clearly highlighted with a comparative analysis between knitted and <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R

25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabric</b> E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites.

25|$|The basic garment {{for both}} genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic), often worn beneath {{one or more}} {{additional}} layers. In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek chiton, to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from {{the eastern part of}} the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted. Though essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.|$|E
500|$|The infighting exasperated Taylor, the US Ambassador to South Vietnam {{and former}} Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who felt the {{disputes}} between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort.

There Taylor asked {{for an end to}} the persistent changes in leadership, and Khánh and his men assured him of stability. Westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the American political class and public against Saigon, as they would deem it useless to support such a regime. Taylor initially cabled the State Department back in the US to state a [...] "naked military fist" [...] had [...] "crumpled [...] carefully <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> of civilian government", and that the arrest of the civilians would be [...] "immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup, setting back all that had been accomplished" [...] since the formation of the HNC and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule. He went on to say that an [...] "inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure...and carry out military arrests of civilians, that group of military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in Vietnam." [...] Taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring US policy recommendations, particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule, at least at a nominal level. Taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid, releasing a public statement saying Washington might reconsider its military funding if [...] "the fabric of legal government" [...] was not reinstated.|$|E

40|$|The tensile {{performance}} of coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under multiaxial loads is {{examined in the}} present study. Two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of {{the configuration of the}} fabric specimen and the loading speed on the multiaxial tensile properties of the fabrics. The configuration of the specimen for the multiaxial tensile tests is identified as gear-shape with large arm widths. A loading speed of lower than 20 mm/min is suggested to obtain the tensile properties of the coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under multiaxial loads. The tensile performances of coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> under uni-, bi-, and multiaxial loads were compared.

Therefore, for the application of the coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> in lightweight structures, biaxial or multiaxial loading conditions will be necessary. Experiments on the specimens with an initial crack in the center under multiaxial loads show that, by comparison with other loading directions, the tensile properties in warp direction of the coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{play an important role in}} the failure performance and crack propagation under multiaxial loads. To eliminate the dependence on the mechanical properties in warp direction, the balance of the two principle directions of coated <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> should be improved.
