500|$|On {{election}} day, Bevin garnered 125,759 votes– 35.4% of the vote– to McConnell's 213,666 votes (60.2%); {{the remaining}} votes were scattered among three lower-profile candidates. In his concession speech, Bevin opined [...] "there is zero {{chance that the}} solutions for what ails us {{is going to come}} from the Democratic Party", but did not endorse McConnell. He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him. During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said [...] "I say <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on. We have new races to run and new decisions to make. There is too much at stake." [...] Asked if the comment amounted to an endorsement of McConnell, Bevin told reporters, [...] "You've got ears." [...] McConnell defeated Grimes in the general election, and Bevin eventually told reporters that he voted for McConnell.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have most}} often {{compared}} {{the film to}} landmark youth films Breathless (also 1960)—released in France five months earlier—directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955), although, Bryan Hartzheim found it takes its youths more seriously and with less sympathy. He stated, [...] " [...] a wrecking ball to what can be considered the indulgencies of the [...] genre, an exhibition of the horrors of uninhibited youth taken to its carnal extremes and matched by a visual accompaniment akin to the abstract and improvised style of a Miles Davis score." [...] Tim Lucas of Video Watchdog magazine called the film [...] "an important rediscovery on many fronts... {{one of the great}} jazz films, and possibly the best illustration the cinema has ever given us of the jazz buff. It's the only film I've ever seen that makes jazz seem scarier than the darkest heavy metal, that makes jazz seem dangerous." [...] For TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion, Alvin Lu commended the score as [...] "stunning" [...] and Kawachi's performance as [...] "ferocious, the very incarnation of the kind of social chaos that could be engendered by too much exposure to jazz, Coke, and hot dogs." [...] The Boston Globe's Wesley Morris wrote, [...] " [...] Kurahara takes the movie to extremes of behavior and style, merging the two until the form seems as violently unstable as the characters. He makes a wave that in Europe was called 'French' and 'new.' But <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jean-Luc Godard, this is breathless - and more interesting, too." [...] Morris further qualified that while Breathless may appeal to contemporary viewers academically, The Warped Ones retains a spontaneous, documentary feel. Schilling discerned the film, [...] "Among [...] boldest departures from studio convention." ...|$|E
500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback took a big step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands out to me. Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E

2500|$|As in his pre-trial appearance, at {{the opening}} of the 19 October Trial Saddam {{appeared}} defiant.

[...] "I do not respond to this so-called court, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> its people, and I retain my constitutional right as the president of Iraq", Saddam declared. He added, [...] "Neither do I recognize the body that has designated and authorized you, nor the aggression because all that has been built on false basis is false."

I want to know who you are." [...] When Amin addressed Saddam as [...] "the former president", Saddam objected emphatically, saying he was still the President of the Republic of Iraq and had not been deposed.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the book's publication, {{during the}} U.S. midterm {{election}} campaign {{period in the}} third week of October 2006, several prominent Democrats criticized both the book and the author, a fellow Democrat. Specifically, Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean issued a statement: [...] "While I have tremendous respect for former President Carter, I fundamentally disagree and do not support his analysis of Israel and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. On this issue President Carter speaks for himself, the opinions in his book are his own, they are not the views or position of the Democratic Party. I and other Democrats will continue to stand with Israel in its battle against terrorism and for a lasting peace with its neighbors." [...] Then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stated: <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> former President Carter, he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel. Democrats have been steadfast in their support of Israel from its birth, in part because we recognize that to do so is in the national security interests of the United States. We stand with Israel now and we stand with Israel forever.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{build-up}} to No Way Out, McMahon had re-signed the New World Order (nWo), {{who started}} a feud {{with him after}} (kayfabe) Austin refused a beer gift following them costing him his match against Jericho. Problems in the backstage creativity were however then seemingly beginning to surface. Austin was reported as being unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan's return to the WWF, and was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match at WrestleMania X8, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin has {{this to say about}} why the match never took place: [...] "I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [...] should have happened", Austin told JR. [...] "Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down. I say that <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> Hulk Hogan, because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day. I didn't think we could deliver". Consequently, the match was re-billed as The Rock defeating Hogan, whilst Austin defeated Scott Hall, climaxing his feud with the nWo.|$|E

2500|$|I {{have also}} to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>due</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E
