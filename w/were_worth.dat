5|$|A new points {{system was}} {{implemented}} in the 2013 Continental Cup of Curling. The total of points available was 60 points, compared to the total of 400 points used in previous years. The mixed doubles, singles, and team games <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> one point each, and ties <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> one half point each to both teams. The skins games <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> {{a total of five}} points. All games were eight ends long, and there were no extra ends. Also, six mixed doubles games and six singles competition games were played, as before. However, there were eighteen team games instead of the previous twelve, and there were six skins games instead of the previous eight.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Philbin {{returned}} to host 12 episodes of a spin-off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $10,000,000. ABC aired five episodes of this spin-off {{during the week}} of February 22, 2004, and an additional seven episodes later that year in May. As usual, contestants had to answer a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The first five questions for Super Millionaire <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), the remaining ten questions <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.|$|E

Leicester's lands in Warwickshire <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> between £500–£700 but Leicester's power and wealth, including monopolies and grants of new lands, depended ultimately on his remaining a favourite of the queen.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 2006, Fischer telephoned an Icelandic {{television}} station {{and pointed out}} a winning combination, missed by the players and commentators.

5|$|Glass Swords is {{the debut}} studio album by Scottish {{producer}} Russell Whyte under his alias of Rustie, released by Warp in 2011. The album was produced and recorded between 2008 and 2010 by Whyte, partially in his father's home in Glasgow, Scotland and partly {{in his own}} home in London, England. The album contains vocal work from Whyte as well as London based producer Nightwave. The final six months of the production sessions involved Whyte attempting to choose and edit which tracks he felt <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> releasing on the final version of Glass Swords.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before he}} was to be arraigned, he drove into a field and shot himself, leaving behind a wife and two children. His was one of four suicides by Looking Glass targets. Critics {{wondered}} if these suicides, which investigators had said they expected, <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> it. In 1999, Comfort also took his own life, citing despondency over the stresses of his job.|$|E

The first clue <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 6 points, the second <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 4 points, and the third <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 2 points. In Michigan and West Virginia, the point system is slightly different.

5|$|The Cal-Neva Lodge {{was built}} in 1926 by real estate {{developer}} Robert P. Sherman. In 1929, Canadian Army Colonel H. H. Betts went missing from his room at the Cal-Neva; his body was found over a year later some five {{miles away from the}} hotel. The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $13,000; she claimed that she had believed that the chips she was using while playing blackjack <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> 50 cents when they were actually valued at $100.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the Raptors {{franchise}} has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the {{value of the}} franchise doubled from US$148million in 2000 to $297million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315million in 2006 to $373million in 2007, and $400million in 2008. By 2016, Forbes estimated the Raptors <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> $920million.|$|E
5|$|With the {{indigenous}} groups {{closer to the}} Caribbean Coast, the people traded highly valuable sea snails. Ironically, the sea snails <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> more than {{the price of gold}} to the Muisca, due to the distance from their location far inland high in the Andes. The skilled goldworking of the Muisca formed the basis for the legend of El Dorado that became widespread among the Spanish conquistadors; this eventually drew them into the heart of Colombia—an ill-fated expedition that took almost a year and cost the lives of about 80% of their men.|$|E
25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} the tricks won in the hand. There {{are several ways to}} count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick <b>is</b> always <b>worth</b> an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 11, tens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 10, kings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four, queens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> three, jacks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> two, and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand. A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of the pieces also makes a significant difference, e.g. pawns near the edges <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less than those near the centre, pawns close to promotion <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> far more, pieces controlling the centre <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> more than average, trapped pieces (such as bad bishops) <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less, etc.|$|R
5000|$|In Christmas episodes, {{two extra}} games were added for [...] "the 12 games of Minute to Win It": the 11th game <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> $2,000,000 and the 12th <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> $3,000,000. In the Spanish version, the 11th game would <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> $150,000 and the 12th would <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> $250,000. Both <b>are</b> milestones.|$|R
5|$|A sale of 1,000 coins {{was made}} to an {{executive}} of the Hudson's Bay Company, and they {{were placed in the}} Archives of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound {{up in the hands of}} a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the Province of Manitoba filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{political}} importance did not {{end with}} his death; his disappearance from the political scene had immediate consequences. In his Welsh lordship of Glamorgan, the uncertain situation caused by his death caused a short-lived rebellion in 1316. In Ireland, where he also held large possessions, the power vacuum he left behind facilitated the 1315 invasion by Robert the Bruce's brother Edward. The greatest consequences, however, resulted from {{the division of the}} de Clare estates. In 1308, Gilbert de Clare had married Maud (or Matilda) de Burgh, the daughter of Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster. The couple left no surviving issue, so his death marked the end of the great de Clare family. The family lands <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> as much as £6,000, second only to those of the Earl of Lancaster among the nobility of the realm.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> half of the assumed value.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the pieces depends on many parameters. For example, GM Larry Kaufman suggests the following values in the middlegame:The Bishop pair <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 7½.The position of the pieces also makes a significant difference, e.g. pawns near the edges <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less than those near the centre, pawns close to promotion <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> far more, pieces controlling the centre <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> more than average, trapped pieces (such as bad bishops) <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> less, etc.|$|R
50|$|Grey nobles, {{typically}} martyrs {{that have}} public sympathy, <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> negative points so the player's {{goal is to}} avoid collecting them if possible. Palace guards, in the red category, have a special value in that each guard <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> {{the total number of}} guards collected. Thus one guard <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> one point, two guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four points, three guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> nine points and so forth. The other Nobles have values ranging from 1 to 5 points.|$|R

5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua somewhere on the hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no longer so lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, {{the game}} utilises the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) {{rendering}} technology. Pre-rendered images are modelled as 3D objects and then transformed into 2D sprites and background layers. Rare founder Tim Stamper served {{as director of}} the game, whereas his colleague Brendan Gunn, who had worked on the original, returned to design the game. Development of Diddy's Kong Quest began shortly after the release of its predecessor. Rare took significant financial risks in purchasing the expensive SGI equipment used to render the graphics. David Wise, Rare's composer from 1985 to 1994, admitted that the workstations Rare purchased <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> £80,000 each. A new compression technique they developed allowed them to incorporate more detail and animation for each sprite for a given memory footprint than previously achieved on the SNES, which better captured the pre-rendered graphics.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties would issue {{their own}} paper money as well. Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty {{to the north}} caught on to this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and <b>were</b> <b>worth</b> a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore a serial number, {{the number of the}} series, and a warning label that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.|$|E
50|$|In round one, {{correct answers}} to the cash {{question}} <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> £100. In round two, with fewer categories left to choose from, correct answers <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> £300, whilst in round three they <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> £601.|$|R
50|$|Only certain cards {{have a point}} value. These {{are known}} as counters. Each 5 <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 5 points, each 10 and 14 <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 10 points, and the Rook Bird card <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> 20 points.|$|R
50|$|Note: Voting was {{conducted}} {{by a panel of}} 112 FCS media members and media relations professionals.
