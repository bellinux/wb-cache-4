The main aim {{of this paper is}} to present a simple and effective regularization method, and investigate the error estimate between the regularization solution and the exact solution.

Based on a sample size of 31, 216 <b>papers,</b> <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> in <b>a</b> median impact factor journal uploaded to Academia. edu receives 16 % more citations after one year than a similar article not available online, 51 % more citations after three years, and 69 % after five years. We also found that articles also posted to Academia. edu had 58 % more citations than articles only posted to other online venues, such as personal and departmental home pages, after five years...|$|R
40|$|To use {{interior}} gateway protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First, [7]), IS-IS (Intermediate System- Intermediate System), and DEFT (Distributed Exponentially-weighted Flow Splitting [...] . {{necessary to}} set the link weights to allow data routing. The problem of finding suitable weights for these protocols {{is known as the}} weight setting problem. Ex-amples of objective functions are network congestion, link utilization, and latency. In the literature <b>we</b> can <b>find</b> <b>a</b> few <b>papers</b> describing methods {{to set the}} link weights according to some protocol. In this <b>paper</b> we present <b>a</b> new memetic algorithm which can be applied to both the OSPF and DEFT protocols, study its performance, and discuss future directions of this work...|$|R
40|$|Properly {{benchmarking}} {{a system}} is a difficult and intricate task. Unfortunately, even a seemingly innocuous benchmarking mistake can compromise the guarantees provided by a given systems security defense and also put its reproducibility and comparability at risk. This threat is particularly insidious as it is generally not a result of malice and can easily go undetected by both authors and reviewers. Moreover, as modern defenses often trade off security for performance in <b>an</b> attempt to <b>find</b> <b>an</b> ideal design point in the performance-security space, {{the damage caused by}} benchmarking mistakes is increasingly worrisome. To analyze the magnitude of the phenomenon, we identify a set of 22 "benchmarking crimes" that threaten the validity of systems security evaluations and perform a survey of 50 defense papers published in top venues. To ensure the validity of our results, we perform the complete survey twice, with two independent readers. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> only <b>a</b> very small number of disagreements between readers, showing that our assessment of benchmarking crimes is highly reproducible. We show that benchmarking crimes are widespread even in papers published at tier- 1 venues. <b>We</b> <b>find</b> that tier- 1 <b>papers</b> commit <b>an</b> average of five benchmarking crimes and <b>we</b> <b>find</b> only <b>a</b> single <b>paper</b> in our sample that committed no benchmarking crimes. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> that the scale of the problem is constant over time, suggesting that the community is not yet addressing it despite the problem being now more relevant than ever. This threatens the scientific process, which relies on reproducibility and comparability to ensure that published research advances the state of the art. We hope to raise awareness of these issues and provide recommendations to improve benchmarking quality and safeguard the scientific process in our community...|$|R
