It was only after Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E

25|$|The window {{paintings}} of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the Naumburg Master, together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of {{the images of the}} saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten bishops of Naumburg {{at the bottom of the}} window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass {{paintings of}} their style from the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|However, the Duke of Perth {{seems to}} have misinterpreted Murray's actions as only a general advance, and the Macdonalds {{on the far left}} simply ignored him. The result was the skewing of the Jacobite front line, with the (left wing) Macdonalds still rooted on the Culloden Parks wall and the (right wing) Atholl Brigade halfway down the Culwhiniac Parks wall. In consequence, large gaps {{immediately}} appeared in the severely over-stretched Jacobite lines. A shocked Sullivan {{had no choice but to}} position the meagre 'second line' to fill the gaps. This second line was (left to right): the Irish Picquets; the Duke of Perth's Regiment; Glenbuchat's; Lord Kilmarnock's Footguards; John Roy Stuart's Regiment; two battalions of Lord Ogilvy's Regiment; the Royal Écossais; two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's Regiment. Farther back were cavalry units. On the left were: Lord Strathallan's Horse Bagot's Hussars and possibly Balmerino's Lifeguards. On the right were Lord Elcho's Lifeguards and Fitzjames's Horse. And in the centre was Charles Edward Stuart's tiny escort made up of Fitzjames's Horse and Lifeguards. When Sullivan's redeployment was completed Perth's and Glenbuchat's regiments <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the extreme left wing and John Roy Stuart's was standing beside Ardsheal's.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Superboy's only superpower is a telekinetic {{force field}} that {{surrounds}} {{his body and}} granted him abilities that approximated some of Superman's powers such as super strength, flight and invulnerability. The field allowed Superboy to lift heavy objects by extending the field around him and deflecting any solid object that {{came into contact with}} him. The field also allowed Superboy the ability to manipulate objects that he came into tactile contact with, bend them into any shape that he could visualize mentally, and disassemble things such as machines and other complex constructions by touch. Under Knockout's training, Superboy learned new ways to use his tactile telekinesis such as projecting telekinetic force waves to blast pieces of ground and extending his field to another person. Superboy can also manipulate solid masses such as volumes of sand or dust causing the individual particles to fly apart in an explosive manner to create particle clouds or a forceful attack. He can also perform the same with solid masses that are splintered, such as a cracked slab of concrete or fractured pane of glass. The telekinetic field also lets Superboy break free of an opponent's grip by pushing the field outward to force the opponent away and he is also able to create an air pocket around himself enabling him to breathe in outer space. In addition, he demonstrated the ability to extend his telekinetic field around other people that he touches to make them invulnerable. He also learned a trick from his older and more experienced alternate self, Black Zero, that allowed him to freeze people where they stood if he was touching the same surface that they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

500|$|On June 16, 2015, The New York Times {{published}} an article reporting the deaths of six Irish students staying in Berkeley, California when the balcony they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> collapsed, the paper's story insinuating {{that they were to}} blame for the collapse. The paper stated that the behavior of Irish students coming to the US on J1 visas was an [...] "embarrassment to Ireland".

500|$|Paparizou's {{first words}} {{after winning the}} 50th Eurovision Song Contest were [...] "We showed the modern face of Greece. I reckon that’s the face {{everybody}} loves.

[...] Upon arrival back in Greece, she was greeted by crowds of fans at Eleftherios Venizelos Airport and the National Fire Brigade created a water-jet archway for her airplane, suggestively bearing the number [...] "001", to pass through after it had landed. On the way to ERT Studios for a welcome party for Paparizou and the Greek delegation, people <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of the}} road throwing rose petals along the route of Paparizou's bus.

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well.

I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with {{a player in the}} centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These [...] "centre passes" [...] alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third. The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> when they caught it touches the ground again. Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least [...] away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball. If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{claim that}} Sydney {{was not at}} action {{stations}} originates from an observation by Detmers; as Sydney approached, the cruiser's [...] guns were unmanned, and sailors in aprons (which he describes as [...] ), <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> deck watching the German ship. This is interpreted by followers of alternate engagement theories as evidence that Sydney was not at action stations, and therefore unable to react when Kormoran unmasked.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a similar}} manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the Holodomor), doctors were {{prohibited}} from listing [...] "starvation" [...] {{as a cause of}} death on death certificates.

In reality, they <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the [...] "field" [...] was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.|$|E

Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only a T-shirt and shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near Lake Arrowhead in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near hypothermia. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in a hot shower. When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> end.
