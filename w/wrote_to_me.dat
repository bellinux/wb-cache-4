500|$|Six {{months later}} he was in back in Ireland, and in August Olivia was visiting Valentine Fox with her husband where she {{received}} news of her father's death. She left for an extended stay in Torquay where she stayed until September before leaving for a visit to Scotland with her husband. Yeats left Ireland for Paris to visit Maud in November, and {{did not return to}} London until January 1897, with Maud following close behind and arriving in London in February. Yeats wrote of Maud's visit: [...] "Maud <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> she was in London & would I come to dine. I dined with her & my trouble increased—she certainly had no thought of the mischief she was doing– & at last one morning.... found my mood did not answer hers and & burst into tears—'There is someone else in your heart' she said. It was the breaking between us for many years". The affair ended that spring when Yeats again returned to Ireland. Olivia did not visit him again at Woburn Place for many years, according to Yeats biographer Richard Ellmann.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bob Geldof, {{then the}} lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, read about the {{incident}} when a news story about it came off the telex at WRAS, the campus radio station at Georgia State University in Atlanta. He was particularly struck by Spencer's claim that she did it {{because she did not}} like Mondays, and began writing a song about it, also incorporating the reporters' [...] "Tell me why?", called [...] "I Don't Like Mondays". It was released in July 1979 and was number 1 for four weeks in the UK, and was the band's biggest hit in their native Ireland. Although it did not make the Top 40 in the U.S. it still received extensive radio airplay (outside of the San Diego area) despite the Spencer family's efforts to prevent it. Geldof has later mentioned that [...] " [...] <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> saying she was glad she'd done it because I'd made her famous, which is not a good thing to live with." ...|$|E
