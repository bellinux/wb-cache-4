5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|Let X and Y be sets. Then {{apply the}} axiom of {{regularity}} {{to the set}} {X,Y}. We see {{there must be an}} element of {X,Y} which is also disjoint from it. It must be either X or Y. By the definition of disjoint then, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> either Y is not an element of X or vice versa.|$|E

This will require an investment in a clinical hospital and in dispensary work. But all this is absolutely necessary to give our {{young men and women}} who take the medical course a proficient training in rational methods of treatment.|$|E

25|$|Proof. Consider a graph on t {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c−1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c−1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c−2 or a K'R(n'c − 1, n'c)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(n'c−1, n'c) <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> either a (c−1)-monochrome K'n'c−1 or a c-monochrome K'n'c. In either case the proof is complete.|$|E
25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, J. Reuben Clark—an LDS apostle and {{a member}} of the church's First Presidency—said that [...] "You and I have heard all our lives that the time may come when the Constitution may hang by a thread.... I do know that whether it shall live or die is now in the balance." [...] Regarding the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its [...] "free institutions", {{separation}} of powers, and the Bill of Rights. [...] He added that [...] "if we are to live as a Church, and progress, and have the right to worship ... <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> the great guarantees that are set up by our Constitution." ...|$|E

500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> done something right." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{crew member}} asked Powers, {{one of the}} students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: [...] "I don't know where we are. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> got lost after that last turn." [...] Cox then transmitted; [...] "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." [...] The response {{after a few moments}} was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. [...] "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" [...] "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, [...] "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
500|$|The {{final round}} of {{negotiations}} started at the royal kraal {{on the morning of}} 30 October. The talks took place at an indaba between the izinDuna and Rudd's party; the king himself did not attend, but was nearby. The izinDuna pressed Rudd and his companions as to where exactly they planned to mine, to which they replied that they wanted rights covering [...] "the whole country". When the izinDuna demurred, Thompson insisted, [...] "No, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> Mashonaland, and right up to the Zambezi as well—in fact, the whole country". According to Thompson's account, this provoked confusion among the izinDuna, who did not seem to know where these places were. [...] "The Zambezi must be there", said one, incorrectly pointing south (rather than north). The Matabele representatives then prolonged the talks through [...] "procrastination and displays of geographical ignorance", in the phrase of the historian Arthur Keppel-Jones, until Rudd and Thompson announced that they were done talking and rose to leave. The izinDuna were somewhat alarmed by this and asked the visitors to please stay and continue, which they did. It was then agreed that inDuna Lotshe and Thompson would together report the day's progress to the king.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E

500|$|The Missouri {{crisis of}} 1819–1821 {{sharpened}} commitments to expansionism among the country's slaveholding interests, when the so-called Thomas proviso established the 36°30' parallel, imposing free-soil and slave-soil futures in the Louisiana Purchase lands. While {{a majority of}} southern congressmen acquiesced {{to the exclusion of}} slavery from the bulk of the Louisiana Purchase, a significant minority objected. Virginian editor Thomas Ritchie of the Richmond Enquirer predicted that with the proviso restrictions, the South would ultimately require Texas: [...] "If we are cooped up on the north, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> elbow room to the west." [...] Representative John Floyd of Virginia in 1824 accused Secretary of State Adams of conceding Texas to Spain in 1819 in the interests of Northern anti-slavery advocates, and so depriving the South of additional slave states. Then-Representative John Tyler of Virginia invoked the Jeffersonian precepts of territorial and commercial growth as a national goal to counter the rise of sectional differences over slavery. His [...] "diffusion" [...] theory declared that with Missouri open to slavery, the new state would encourage the transfer of underutilized slaves westward, emptying the eastern states of bondsmen and making emancipation feasible in the old South. This doctrine would be revived during the Texas annexation controversy.|$|E
