50|$|The year 2011 {{was named}} <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Year</b> in {{recognition}} of the 250th anniversary of the founding of the world’s first veterinary school in Lyon, France, in 1761, which was followed in 1764 by the founding of the Alfort veterinary school, near Paris, both at the initiative of French veterinarian Claude Bourgelat.|$|E
50|$|The Veterinary Council of Ireland hosted special {{ceremony}} on 14 February 2011 at 2.00pm in the Royal Dublin Society Concert Hall to mark <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Year</b> 2011. The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, {{attended the}} ceremony as guest of honour. The Veterinary Council {{has decided to}} mark this important year for the profession by awarding commemorative medals to veterinary surgeons who have served the profession {{on the island of}} Ireland over the past 50 or more years. Veterinary surgeons who have been registered in Northern Ireland for the same period were also invited to receive a medal. The world’s first veterinary school was founded in Lyon, France, in 1761, shortly followed by the Alfort veterinary school, near Paris, in 1764, both of them at the initiative of French veterinarian, Claude Bourgelat. By setting up the world’s first veterinary training institutions, Bourgelat created the veterinary profession itself. Thus, 2011 also marks the 250th world anniversary of the veterinary profession.|$|E

40|$|Foreword and {{acknowledgements}} Some amazingly {{detailed and}} scholarly {{accounts of the}} history of the veterinary profession have been written—but this is not one of them. As a small booklet, this document can only paint the very broadest brushstrokes {{of the history of}} government veterinarians (vets) in Australia. This booklet also aims to celebrate the many achievements of government vets in Australia, and reveal the obstacles they faced, without— hopefully—boring the reader to death. Some personal observations (in brackets) are scattered throughout the book to keep things interesting. While an anecdotal history, this booklet refers to existing historical research, and uncovers a past which does government vets and the veterinary profession in general great credit. It is fitting, then, that this booklet is the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s official contribution to celebrating <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Year</b> in 2011. Many people assisted with the production of this booklet by providing materials, comments, references and permissions. They include the following: state and territory Chief Veterinary Officers; staff and members of the Australian Veterinary Association and Australian Veterinary Historical Society...|$|E

50|$|Dr John Gamgee, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Dick Veterinary College, Edinburgh invited other {{veterinary}} {{academics and}} veterinarians from Europe {{to a meeting}} at Hamburg, Germany in July 1863. This later {{became known as the}} <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Congress and was attended by 103 veterinarians from ten countries. The objective of the meeting was to coordinate the response to rinderpest and other epizootic diseases. At the sixth such congress in Budapest, Hungary in 1906, a permanent committee was set up to provide an organisational link between the congresses, and at the sixteenth congress in Madrid, Spain, in 1959, it was determined to form the <b>World</b> <b>Veterinary</b> Association (WVA). At the same congress, a decision was taken to also set up the International Association of Small Animal Specialists, for organisations representing small animal practitioners, and this had its first meeting two years later in London. By the twenty-fifth congress in Yokohama, Japan, in 1995, there were over ten thousand participants representing 82 countries.|$|R

The workshop was attended by academics and representatives from leading pharmaceutical companies, regulatory experts, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission. We here outline the present regulatory pathways for genetically engineered vaccines in Europe and describe the incentive for {{the organization of the}} pre-congress workshop. The participants agreed that existing European regulations on the deliberate release of genetically engineered vaccines into the environment should be updated to facilitate quick deployment of these vaccines in emergency situations. </p...|$|R
