25|$|Fiesta (originally called Fiesta Brava) starred Williams as Ricardo Montalbán's twin sister, Maria, who {{pretends to}} be her bullfighting brother in hopes of luring him back home. Audiences, and Williams, thought the film <b>was</b> <b>silly,</b> as Williams and Montalbán had vastly {{different}} accents. Montalbán was born in Mexico and was a native Spanish speaker while Williams had a mid-western accent picked up from her Kansas-born parents. Production was difficult with a multitude of problems. By 1947, Gage and Williams were married. Gage had traveled to Mexico for {{the making of the}} film. He got into a fight with an employee of the cast's hotel, was arrested, and subsequently thrown out of the country.The director of photography, Sidney Wagner, and one other crew member died of cholera from eating contaminated street food. Many of the film's stuntmen were sent to the hospital after being gored by bulls. Director Dick Thorpe hadn't wanted the bulls killed (as they usually were {{at the end of a}} bullfight) because he believed them to be too expensive to replace.|$|E

There {{were a lot of}} tracks, though, where I played bass... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{opinion poll}} by Gallup, {{participants}} {{were asked if they}} felt the renaming of French fries and toast was [...] "a silly idea or a sincere expression of patriotism"; 66% answered it <b>was</b> <b>silly,</b> 33% answered it was patriotic, and 1% had no opinion. Several restaurants followed the Houses' change, and the name is still used by the chain restaurant Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill. Opposing the name change, The Saturn Cafe in Santa Cruz, California changed their menu to [...] "Impeach George W. Bush fries". Meanwhile Reckitt Benckiser, maker of French's mustard, were sufficiently concerned about the movement to publicly clarify that its brand derived from a family name.|$|E

500|$|Rebbie later {{revealed}} {{that there was}} a lot of discussion at the time of the release of Centipede over whether she should use the Jackson surname professionally or not. To begin with, Rebbie did not want to use her pre-marriage surname, but later reasoned that it <b>was</b> <b>silly</b> to deny her heritage. Jackson explained that she did, however, compromise with the use of her family name on the Centipede album cover [...] "Rebbie is large and Jackson is small". She further stated that the success of siblings Michael and Janet had not been a hindrance to her, but served as an enhancement to her career. Rebbie added that she did not have to worry about [...] "name recognition".|$|E
500|$|... "Papa Don't Preach" [...] is {{a message}} song that {{everyone}} is going to take the wrong way.

When I first heard the song, I thought it <b>was</b> <b>silly.</b> But then I thought, wait a minute, this song is really about a girl who is making a decision in her life. She has a very close relationship with her father and wants to maintain that closeness. To me it's a celebration of life. It says, 'I love you, father, and I love this man and this child that is growing inside me'. Of course, who knows how it will end? But at least it starts off positive." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Reese, various other {{suggestions}} were made for the role including rock musician Sting. Cameron chose Michael Biehn for the role. Biehn was originally skeptical about the part, feeling that the film <b>was</b> <b>silly.</b> After meeting with Cameron, Biehn stated his [...] "feelings about the project changed". Hurd stated that [...] "almost everyone else who {{came in from the}} audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off." [...] To get into Kyle Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contains}} a live-action segment featuring characters {{from the show}} as puppets and a guest appearance from singer Katy Perry as herself. It parodies the two television series The Muppet Show and Sesame Street, both of which feature the puppet characters The Muppets. References to those shows include puppet versions of Grampa and Jasper heckling the cast of the Simpsons puppet show from a box seat {{in the manner of}} Statler and Waldorf from The Muppet Show, and Moe devouring cookies like Cookie Monster does on Sesame Street. Brad Trechak of AOL TV noted that [...] "the plot of the segment <b>was</b> <b>silly</b> and simplistic in line with the style of Sesame Street but had some real adult moments like one would see on The Muppet Show." ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{video game}} journalists and enthusiasts {{including}} Thomas, Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack, GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer, and 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, {{refer to the}} fourth installment as {{a turning point for}} the quality of titles in the Mega Man series. Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game, likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System {{at the time of its}} release. Parrish proclaimed, [...] "Here's where the series starts to go off the rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out <b>was</b> <b>silly,</b> the music was terrible, the bosses and weapons were uninspired, and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game-breaking innovation." [...] Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless, one of the concepts that set the Mega Man games apart from other action-platformers.|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented, [...] "It’s {{one of the}} tougher-sounding Spears singles yet {{and should}} do the job as a dancefloor-filler for {{listeners}} who are starting to wear out on the latest singles from Katy Perry and The Black Eyed Peas". However, he also dismissed the lyrical content and said that Spears sounds [...] "bored [...] {{as is the case}} with most of her recent work." [...] Michael Cragg of British newspaper The Guardian called it [...] "decent enough." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone referred to the song as [...] "prime Britney" [...] and stated that it [...] "promises great things for her album." [...] Jim Cantiello of MTV felt the use of pick-up lines <b>was</b> <b>silly,</b> but praised the beat and the vocals, while calling the breakdown [...] "awesome". Jim Farber of the Daily News called it [...] "a dance-ready club song" [...] and added, [...] "With all that behind her, the 'Oops' girl may yet do it again", referencing her hit [...] "Oops!...

500|$|The Gottlieb {{staff had}} {{difficulty}} naming the game. Aside {{from the project}} name [...] "Cubes", it was untitled {{for most of the}} development process. The staff agreed the game should be named after the main character, but disagreed on the name. Lee's title for the initial concept—Snots And Boogers—was rejected, as was a list of suggestions compiled from company employees. According to Davis, vice president of marketing Howie Rubin championed [...] as the title. Although staff members argued it <b>was</b> <b>silly</b> and would be impossible to pronounce, a few early test models were produced with [...] as the title on the units' artwork. During a meeting, [...] "Hubert" [...] was suggested, and a staff member thought of combining [...] "Cubes" [...] and [...] "Hubert" [...] into [...] "Cubert". Art director Richard Tracy changed the name to [...] "Q-bert", and the hyphen was later changed to an asterisk. In retrospect, Davis expressed regret for the asterisk, because he felt it prevented the name from becoming a common crossword term and it is a wildcard character for search engines.|$|E
500|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees has been {{depicted as a}} non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in Jason Takes Manhattan where the character cries out [...] "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" [...] in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in Jason Goes To Hell where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine Salon's Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a [...] "silent, expressionless...blank slate." [...] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, [...] "...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a great white shark. You can't really defeat him. All you {{can hope for is}} to survive." [...] Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Jason has been a [...] "virtually indestructible" [...] being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it <b>was</b> <b>silly</b> that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get [...] "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason {{to be more of a}} [...] "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to {{his original}} resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in The New Blood, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in Jason Takes Manhattan.|$|E

2500|$|Cuzzoni's {{arrival in}} the English capital was keenly {{anticipated}} in the press. Though the [...] "London Journal" [...] for 27 October 1722 reported that [...] "Mrs. Cotsona , an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily", she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel's Ottone at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well that you are a real she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, me, that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and <b>was</b> <b>silly</b> and fantastical." ...|$|E
