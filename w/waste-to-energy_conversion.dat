50|$|The {{basic concept}} behind waste {{management}} is the waste hierarchy, {{where the most}} effective approaches to managing waste are at the top. Waste management {{is in contrast to}} waste minimisation. Waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on re-use, recycling, and <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> rather than eliminating the creation of waste in the initial phases of production. Waste minimisation involves efforts to minimize resource and energy use during manufacture. For the same commercial output, usually the less materials are used, the less waste is produced. Waste minimisation usually requires knowledge of the production process, cradle-to-grave analysis (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and detailed knowledge of the composition of the waste.|$|E
40|$|China—the largest {{developing}} {{country in the}} world—is experiencing both rapid economic maturation and large-scale urbanization. These situations have led to waste disposal problems, {{and the need to}} identify alternative energy sources. <b>Waste-to-energy</b> (WTE) <b>conversion</b> processes, a source of renewable energy, are expected to play an increasingly important role in China’s sustainable management of municipal solid waste (MSW). The purpose of this research is to investigate the key problems and opportunities associated with WTE, to provide recommendations for the government. This paper begins by describing China’s current MSW management situation and analyzing its waste disposal problems. The major challenges associated with China’s WTE incineration are then discussed from economic, environmental and social points of view. These include the high costs associated with constructing necessary facilities, the susceptibility of facilities to corrosion, the lower heating value of China’s MSW, air pollutant emissions and especially public opposition to WTE incineration. Since discarded waste can be used to produce energy for electricity and heat—thus reducing its volume and the production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—with government policies and financial incentives, the use of WTE incineration as a renewable energy source and part of a sustainable waste management strategy will be of increasing importance in the future. The paper concludes by summarizing the management, economic and social benefits that could be derived from developing the country’s domestic capacity for producing the needed incineration equipment, improving source separation capabilities, standardizing regulatory and legal responsibilities and undertaking more effective public consultation processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} four {{strategies for}} managing the Mixed Municipal Solid Waste (MMSW) {{in terms of their}} environmental impacts and potential advantages by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. To this aim, both a multi-input and a multi-output approach are applied to evaluate the effect of these perspectives on selected impact categories. The analyzed management options include direct landfilling with energy recovery (S- 1), Mechanical-Biological Treatment (MBT) followed by <b>Waste-to-Energy</b> (WtE) <b>conversion</b> (S- 2), a combination of an innovative MBT/MARSS (Material Advanced Recovery Sustainable Systems) process and landfill disposal (S- 3), and finally a combination of the MBT/MARSS process with WtE conversion (S- 4). The MARSS technology, developed within an European LIFE PLUS framework and currently implemented at pilot plant scale, is an innovative MBT plant having the main goal to yield a Renewable Refined Biomass Fuel (RRBF) to be used for combined heat and power production (CHP) under the regulations enforced for biomass-based plants instead of Waste-to-Energy systems, for increased environmental performance. The four scenarios are characterized by different resource investment for plant and infrastructure construction and different quantities of matter, heat and electricity recovery and recycling. Results, calculated per unit mass of waste treated and per unit exergy delivered, under both multi-input and multi-output LCA perspectives, point out improved performance for scenarios characterized by increased matter and energy recovery. Although none of the investigated scenarios is capable to provide the best performance in all the analyzed impact categories, the scenario S- 4 shows the best LCA results in the human toxicity and freshwater eutrophication categories, i. e. the ones with highest impacts in all waste management processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With {{the rapid}} growth in urban population, {{sustainable}} waste management {{has become a major}} challenge. Despite being considered an economic, environmental and social burden on communities, waste can also be a resource. The potential of utilising MSW in energy generation has been widely investigated, as a dual solution to the issues of waste management and energy security. Different <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> technologies have varying levels of impact on human health and environment. In assessing the viability of using MSW in renewable energy systems, it is necessary to understand associated risks. This study addresses the lack of information the link between MSW based-energy generation and human health risks. Mass incineration and refuse derived fuel (RDF) conversion technologies were assessed to evaluate the overall life cycle human health risks due to the processes. The life cycle emissions due to incineration and RDF were assessed using SimaPro software, for a case study on a region in British Columbia, Canada. The results indicate that RDF carries a lower health risk per GWh of energy generated per annum, when compared with incineration. The analysis was further extended to the Sri Lankan context, considering the local waste mix. This information will be useful for urban developers and decision makers in selecting the most suitable <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> technologies, while mitigating the health risks to population...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{renewable}} energy sources represent an important solution to environmental impact and socio-economic problems because they promote the sustainable development and the energy security. Among {{renewable energy}} sources, biomass is the most interesting source because {{it is possible to}} produce many useful fuels from biomass and because <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> is a useful alternative way for waste management. The main drawback is that biomass has low energy content. Coupling biomass with fuel cells it possible to convert the chemical energy stored in biomass to electricity with high efficient. The biofuels useful for fuel cell are gaseous such as biogas. The main advantage to use biogas as fuel for high temperature fuel cell is that reformed methane and carbon monoxide are fuels and carbon dioxide is a diluent.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} demand for electrical energy, {{it is certain}} that the production will also increase,especially in rapid developing countries like India. Rapid industrialization is carving for more electrical energy, investment and suitable space for its infrastructure. But this development has to be sustainable keeping in mind the increasing global temperature due to pollution. India is the second largest population in the world and hence produces a lot of waste daily. As of now, most of the waste goes to the landfills and gets burnt there or decomposed, either way releasing greenhouse gases in the process and degrading the environment. The municipal waste management is a challenging process in developing countries because of non-availability of proper infrastructure. There are some methods to manage this waste, such as scientific landfills,Incineration, Biomethanation, Gasification, Pyrolysis and Plasma Arc Gasification. By Gasification the solid waste is converted into synthesis gas which can be used for chemical industries, power generation, transportation and industrial heating etc. This process shrinks the solid waste to slag or ash which can either be used to manufacture eco bricks or can be disposed of on landfill. Thus saving a lot of place from land filling and if used for power generation it does not release any considerable harmful gases into the environment making it a sustainable process and partially renewable source of energy. This project will estimate the capital requirement and procedure to setup a 1 MW gasification plant in Indian state of Telangana. In the study, the generation, composition, treatment and energy potential of solid waste have been studied.

40|$|Bioenergy {{addresses}} {{three important}} social concerns: security of energy supply, mitigation {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions and development of agriculture. Bioenergy is the energy generated by either direct or indirect combustion of biomass, which is non-fossil organic material of both vegetable and animal origins. Different technologies are currently available for bioenergy production, but fuel cells {{are one of the}} most interesting devices because of their environmental benefits and their high efficiency. In particular, molten carbonate fuel cells are suitable devices for <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> because of their ability to be fed with biogas, which is biomass-derived gas rich in methane and carbon dioxide. Indeed, methane can be internally reformed to hydrogen, carbon dioxide is a safe diluent preventing electrolyte loss, and carbon monoxide acts both as a hydrogen supplier and as an actual fuel. Unfortunately, biogas impurities, such as sulfur, halogen and nitrogen compounds, cause adverse effects on cell performances. The most dangerous impurities are sulfur compounds, among whom hydrogen sulphide is the predominant and the most harmful chemicals. It reacts with nickel-based anode to form nickel sulphides, that block catalytic sites, slowing hydrogen oxidation down, and change the anode wettability in molten carbonates, compromising the optimal electrolyte distribution within cell components. Poisoning mechanism of hydrogen sulphide depends on operating conditions such as current density, anodic gas composition, temperature and pressure. The aim of this work is to study hydrogen sulphide effects on MCFCs by means of multiple regression analysis. The mathematical approach gives us tools to define the main sulfur poisoning mechanism under MCFC operating conditions, quantify the effects of the main parameters affecting poison actions, such as current density, hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide, and identify their mutual interactions. Also it is possible to formulate a multivariate model to predict sulfur poisoning. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the novel MILP {{formulation of the}} Biomass Value Chain Model (BVCM), a comprehensive and flexible optimisation toolkit that models {{a large number of}} bioenergy system pathways. The model accounts for the economic and environmental impacts associated with the end-to-end elements of a pathway: crop production, conversion technologies, transport, storage, local purchase, import (from abroad), sale and disposal of resources, as well as CO 2 sequestration by CCS technologies and forestry. It supports decision-making around optimal use of land, biomass resources and technologies with respect to different objectives, scenarios and constraints. Objectives include minimising cost, maximising profit, minimising GHG emissions, maximising energy/exergy production or any combination of these. These objectives are combined with a number of scenarios (such as including different CO 2 prices, different technology and climate scenarios, import scenarios, waste cost scenarios), different credits (e. g. by-product and end-product, CCS and forestry carbon sequestration) and a number of constraints such as minimum levels of energy production and maximum environmental impacts. The toolkit includes an extensive database of different biomass technologies including pretreatment, densification, liquid and gaseous fuel production, heat and power generation (separately or combined, biodedicated or co-fired), <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> and carbon capture and sequestration. A large number of resources are considered including a variety of bio-resources (e. g. energy crops such as Miscanthus and SRC willow, arable crops such as winter wheat, sugar beet and oilseed rape and short and long rotation forestry), intermediates, products, by-products and wastes.

In India, Karanja (Pongamia pinnata) a non-edible oil seed {{is considered}} as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. The de-oiled cakes of Karanja seed obtained from expeller units are of no use, and are disposed in the open. The disposal of such non edible oil cake in the open and land fill generates various anthropogenic gases, and may increase the global warming potential (GWP). The organic matters contained in these de-oiled cakes can be converted to useful energy by adopting a proper <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> process. Hence, an attempt was made in this investigation to use the Karanja seed cake (SCK) as a potential feedstock for producing biogas by anaerobic digestion, and the produced biogas was proposed as an alternative fuel for CI engines. Initially, biogas was produced from four different proportions of SCK mixed with cattle dung (CD) in small scale rectors, to study the different parameters effecting the biogas production. The SCK-CD was mixed in the proportion of 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100 in percentage on a mass basis, and the mixtures were denoted as S 1, S 2, S 3, and S 4 respectively. Important parameters, such as the pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) were evaluated and analyzed.

40|$|Among {{the biggest}} and most serious issues faced by a nation due to the impacts of {{urbanization}} an population explosion is the rate of waste generation. Per capita generation in Peninsular Malaysia is approximately 1. 2 kg of municipal solid waste (MSW) everyday which amounts to 18, 000 tonnes. Application of various tools to determine the efficiency of a system has been very helpful in minimizing costs and optimizing a desired system. This study was conducted to design an integrated solid waste management system and to determine the best integrated technology in terms of efficiency, cost and performance. SWPlan software was utilized to determine the appropriate waste management approaches including waste reduction, recycling, composting, <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion,</b> landfill disposal and others. The software was able to determine the capital operating cost and management costs, by taking into consideration the possible revenues from alternate options of waste disposal. Among the options which were examined included refuse derived fuel (RDF) conversion, recycling activities and other by-products from waste treatment options such as composting. In order to evaluate the potentials of SWPlan, information on population density, waste composition and amount were defined according to data obtained from waste management studies conducted earlier. Results indicated that waste generated by communities in Selangor in particular and Malaysians in general composed of a high percentage of organic waste, accounting for approximately 46 % of the total tonnage. The option of composting, including yard waste composting and MSW composting were derived from the software application as it was found to offer the best system with the consideration of cost and energy efficiency. Findings also indicated the possibility of implementing RDF conversion to divert the waste stream which not only reduced the disposal cost but also generated significant amounts of revenue for waste managers. The other viable application is recycling.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} potential future {{systems for}} waste-to-energy {{production in the}} Baltic Sea Region, and especially for the project REMOWE partner regions, the County of Västmanland in Sweden, Northern Savo in Finland, Lower Silesia in Poland, western part of Lithuania and Estonia. The waste-to-energy systems planned for in the partner regions are combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW) and solid recovered fuels from household and industry as well as anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agriculture waste. The potential future waste-to-energy systems in the partner regions include increased utilization of available waste resources. Examples of resources possible to use are straw {{that could be used}} for ethanol production and biowaste from households and manure {{that could be used for}} biogas production. If the utilization in all partner regions would reach the same level as already exists in the County of Västmanland it would correspond to an increased energy supply of 3 TWh/year which corresponds to about 2. 5 % of the total energy use in the partner regions year 2008. An important aspect of future anaerobic processes for biogas production is the possibility to use the residue. West Lithuanian biogas production residue is planned to be dewatered up to 90 % of dry matter to make future utilization options possible. Pre-processing is necessary to be able to use the residue from digestion of solid waste as fertilizer. The pre-processing should include crushing, removal of metals, wood and plastics, and pulping. Without pre-processing it is possible to combust the residues with energy utilisation. Results from an investigation of the residues from biogas production tests using substrates from the project partner regions show a remaining energy potential of the digestate corresponding to 17 to 50 % of the biogas energy. A combination of digestate combustion and fertilizer use could be a possibility. Hydrothermal carbonization, HTC, is a process that could be of interest to use for treating digestate in order both to utilize the energy left after biogas production but also for sanitation of the digestate. In this process heat is released and coal is produced. This process could also be of interest for <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> of waste which is usually not usable for other biological process like e. g. biogas production, for example sharp leaved rush, straw or leaves from gardening etc. Initial tests on pulp and paper waste show promising results. Among the possible processes for increasing the output of biogas from anaerobic digestion using ultrasound technology for thickening of surplus waste water sludge can be mentioned. It allows increasing the biogas production up to 30 % and reducing the amount of organic substances in the digested sewage sludge by up to 25 %. Another area of possible improvement is the mixing in the digester. The mixing is important for distribution of microorganisms and nutrition, inoculation of fresh feed, homogenizing of the material and for the removal of end products of the metabolism. Studies of the digester for biowaste in the County of Västmanland indicate that about 30 % of digester volume can have dead and stagnant zones. 2 Waste-to-energy utilisation could also be possible to realise by further development and introduction of new processes and concepts. An option for solving the problem of old sewage sludge could be to use it in a gasifier to convert it to energy rich gases. Microbiological conversion of waste can be further developed to produce several different products, such as heat, power, fuels and chemicals, the development of so-called biorefineries. Also the biorefinery‘s water management can be renewed in order to remove toxic substances, minimize environmental impacts and produce pure, clean water. Finnoflag Oy has developed a technology that converts waste materials into e. g. fuels, chemicals, plastic and rubber via low-energy routes. The Finnoflag technology is based on the PMEU (Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit) which is a new innovative instrument for use in the microbe detection process and that is designed to create an optimal growth environment for microbes. For fibrous and well-structured biowaste dry digestion could be a good option for biogas production. Several different configurations have been tested in Germany. The garage digestion method has the advantage that an extensive pre- treatment of substrate is not necessary and no pumps or stirrers, which can be destroyed by disturbing materials, are involved. However, the efficiency of garage digesters is low compared to other digestion methods due to lack of effective substrate turbation. More research work is needed to improve the efficiency. Tests of five existing dry digestion processes show that the Tower-digester is the most suitable dry digestion method for household waste. Among the reviewed plants the Dranco-tower digester showed the best efficiency in reference to biogas potential. The plant design is robust enough to handle substrates like household waste with fractions of disturbing materials. The mixing in the reactor is based on the force of gravity and the used pumps are powerful and very resistant. Pyrolysis is a process of interest for converting wood based waste into energy products such as gas, bio-oil and/or solid fuel/carbon. This has been identified as a process suitable for a new business model with a franchise based model, offering an earning opportunity for small size entrepreneurs. Possible improvement of existing and new waste-to-energy systems also includes increasing the overall efficiency of the utilization of waste resources by integration of several processes. A study on integrating pellets production from the residues from straw-based ethanol production with an existing combined heat and power plant shows that the total production cost can be reduced by the integration. Possible development of waste-to-energy systems for the partner regions could be the following:  Estonian - biogas production using the organic waste, use of the digestate as fertilizer on demand or combustion for power and heat production, recycling plants for paper, plastics and other recyclable wastes and combustion for power and heat production after recycling  North Savo, Finland- the same options as for Estonia is of interest. Added to this is the potential for power and heat production from large amount of wood waste. Also the possibility for pellet production from wood waste could be of interest.  Western Lithuania- the same system as mentioned for Finland is also of interest for western Lithuania. 3 　  Lower Silesia, Poland- also for Lower Silesia high amounts of organic wastes is suitable to use for biogas production in anaerobic digestion. Recovered derived fuel (RDF) is already used as fuel for power and heat production. There are also some attempts to involve combustion of residual mixed waste in 1 - 2 of the most densely populated areas.  County of Västmanland, Sweden- Here a system for separate collection of the biowaste from households, digestion of the fraction together with ley crop silage from regional farmers to produce biogas and use of the digestate from the digestion process as fertilizer at farmland already exists and a new power and heat plant using recovered derived fuels is under construction. Further waste- to-energy plants for production of bioethanol from straw and biogas from agricultural waste could be possible. The potential future waste-to-energy systems are not only dependent on available technologies for <b>waste-to-energy</b> <b>conversion</b> but also on the development within the waste and energy areas including also economic and political aspects. There is a growing interest for waste prevention in waste management within the EU, and growing concern about food losses and food waste at global and national levels. During past decades the waste amounts have steadily increased with economic growth but due to waste prevention actions a decoupling of the waste amount and economic growth is foreseen. This has to be considered in development of future waste-to-energy systems. Further, policies and goals concerning fossil fuel free transportation systems and low carbon energy systems is of importance. Analysis of combined previous proposed scenarios for energy demand and use development and waste amount development for waste-to-energy in Sweden 2010 to 2050 shows that the contribution of waste-to-energy to the total energy supply in 2050 varies from 6 to 47 % depending on the scenarios combined. The lowest contribution occur for scenarios with low waste amounts combined with energy scenarios with low changes in energy demand while the highest contribution occurs for scenarios with high amount of waste combined with energy scenarios with large decrease in energy demand.
