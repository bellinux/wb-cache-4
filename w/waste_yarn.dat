5000|$|Provisional cast-on : Also {{known as}} an [...] "invisible cast-on," [...] since the <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> used can be pulled out later to allow the knitter to {{continue}} the knitting in the opposite direction. This cast-on is also the best method for double-knit fabrics, since the knitting has no boundary; the knitting is continuous {{from one side of}} the fabric to the other. Holding the ends of a <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> and the working yarn, make an overhand knot. Place a needle held in the left hand between the two yarns, with the knot below, the <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> held underneath and parallel to the needle out to the right, and the working yarn up and in front of the needle. Bring the working yarn down behind the needle and in front of the waste yarn; up behind the <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> and over-and-up then down in front of the needle; down behind the waste yarn; then up in front of the needle. Repeat for each two stitches. When desired number of stitches is reached, loosely fasten the <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> and work as usual with the working yarn. To take out the provisional cast-on, unfasten the end of the <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> and carefully pull it out, picking up the now loose loops on a needle and working from the opposite direction of previous work.|$|E
5000|$|Provisional chain cast-on : Simply the crochet chain cast-on using waste yarn; {{this is also}} an [...] "invisible cast-on" [...] {{that can}} be pulled out later to allow {{knitting}} in the opposite direction. Work a crochet chain in <b>waste</b> <b>yarn,</b> loosely fastening the tail end. With working yarn, pick up the chain-bumps, as for the crochet chain cast-on, to create the working stitches. To take out the cast-on, simply pull out {{the tail of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> at the fastened end and [...] "zip off" [...] the crochet chain. Pick up the now loose loops and work from the opposite direction of previous work. This is done in toe-up socks and shawls or scarves with directional patterns that need to start from a center edge.|$|E
5000|$|Double cast-on : A common method, {{in which}} all the loops are made with one yarn, while the other end (the {{dangling}} end from the original slip knot) is used to secure the base of each loop. This method is also called the [...] "knit half-hitch cast on" [...] or the [...] "long-tail cast on." [...] Although popular, this method requires that the knitter estimate the length of the dangling yarn before the stitches are cast on; if the dangling yarn is too short, the knitter will run out of yarn with which to secure the stitches before the full number of stitches have been cast on. In that case, the knitter will have to pull everything out, re-position the slip knot to give a longer tail, and begin anew. Despite this shortcoming, it's a good all-around method for casting on. Another variation for this method is to use two different yarns, one the main yarns that you are using for your project, and the second a piece of contrasting <b>waste</b> <b>yarn.</b> You attach the two with a slip knot, and then using the waste or contrast yarn as your long tail, start your row. This is useful if you need to pick up stitches on your cast on edge in order to knit in the opposite direction. You can also use it decoratively, making the contrast or <b>waste</b> <b>yarn</b> a part of your pattern design. To execute it, you start by figuring out how much yarn you expect your cast-on row to require and pulling out that amount of yarn. Once you have that, put a slip knot on the needle (this is not absolutely necessary, since the first cast-on stitch will create a slip knot for you in the process, but it is generally more secure to start with a slip knot). Hold the needle in your right hand and the yarn in your left, with the long tail pulled around your thumb and hanging in front, and the yarn from ball around your first or second finger, with the ball tail heading toward the back. Once you have that, take the needle under the front of the long tail, picking up a half hitch, then back to the yarn over your finger from the top side of the yarn, pulling the loop through the half hitch you had formed. This cast on can also be done in a purl and a twisted stitch version as well.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} methods to reduce the {{production}} costs is waste recycling {{which is the most}} important challenge for the future. Cotton wastes collected from ginning process have desirable properties which could be used during spinning process. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop predictive models of breaking strength and mass irregularity (CV%) of cotton <b>waste</b> rotor-spun <b>yarns</b> containing cotton <b>waste</b> collected from ginning process by using the artificial neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. Artificial neural network models have been developed based on rotor diameter, rotor speed, navel type, opener roller speed, ginning <b>waste</b> proportion and <b>yarn</b> linear density as input parameters. The parameters of artificial neural network model, namely, learning, and momentum rate, number of hidden layers and number of hidden processing elements (neurons) were optimized to get the best predictive models. The findings showed that the breaking strength and mass irregularity of rotor spun yarns could be predicted satisfactorily by artificial neural network. The maximum error in predicting the breaking strength and mass irregularity of testing data was 8. 34 % and 6. 65 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Composites {{consisting}} of <b>waste</b> cotton <b>yarn</b> (CF) from the textile industry and postconsumer expanded polystyrene (EPS) was followed during 90 days of exposure in simulated soil. The mechanical properties, morphologies and chemical natures of the composites were determined {{before and after}} exposure in simulated soil. The composites were made using a single-screw extrusion, a twin-screw extrusion and injection molding. The composites showed an increase of the mechanical properties nearly 50 % {{in relation to the}} recycled expanded polystyrene (rEPS). After exposure in simulated soil the composites presented losses of mechanical properties. Evidence of the oxidation of the samples was demonstrated by the increase in the values of the carbonyl index after 30 days of exposure in simulated soil. Changes in the color of the surface of the sample were observed after 90 days of exposure and are due to the fungi and bacteria colonization on the surface...|$|R
30|$|Findings {{from this}} study {{indicate}} that use of a PAS mordant does influence dye concentration, hue, and colorfastness to light and laundering of sawmill <b>waste</b> dyed wool <b>yarn</b> with implications for the triple bottom line. Perhaps the most important finding is that the PAS mordant decreased the amount of sawmill waste dyestuff by 10 – 150  % to achieve expected color depth. As trees are slow to replenish, using less and using an existing timber byproduct as dyestuff has environmental and economic value. Using invasive tree species also helps the environment by assisting to balance prairie and pastureland ecosystems.|$|R
50|$|The great {{wheel is}} usually over 5 ft in height. The large drive wheel turns the much smaller spindle assembly, with the spindle {{revolving}} many times for each {{turn of the}} drive wheel. The yarn is spun at an angle off {{the tip of the}} spindle, and is then stored on the spindle. To begin spinning on a great wheel, first a leader (a length of <b>waste</b> <b>yarn)</b> is tied onto the base of the spindle and spiraled up to the tip. Then the spinner overlaps a handful of fiber with the leader, holding both gently together with the left hand, and begins to slowly turn the drive wheel clockwise with the right hand, while simultaneously walking backward and drawing the fibre in the left hand away from the spindle at an angle. The left hand must control the tension on the wool to produce an even result. Once a sufficient amount of yarn has been made, the spinner turns the wheel backward a short distance to unwind the spiral on the spindle, then turns it clockwise again, and winds the newly made yarn onto the spindle, finishing the wind-on by spiralling back out to the tip again to make another draw.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe study aims to {{investigate}} Art teaching ideas and activities enhancing pre-engineering students’ prospects for their forthcoming career path. The designed approach embraces the integration between fundamental structural forces and applied art as to facilitate learners’ developing of abstract, unsophisticated features. The samples of model conversion from 2 D illustrations to abstract, tangible 3 D engineering configurations incorporate {{the representation of}} glass and steel low-rise and high-rise building structures, as well as long span bridges being generated from compression and tension principles. Concisely, students’ fabricated models feature the balanced combination of engineering conceptual design coupled with the aesthetics aspect of artwork. Materials for structural design cover normal items such as paper, plaster, rubber, cloth <b>waste</b> and <b>yarn.</b> Ninety pre- engineering {{in the first year}} were classified into 3 classes, each of which contained 6 groups of 5 members. Subsequent to the developed instructional approach, the samples could create 7 pieces of model representation in one semester. The performance evaluation, measured from fundamental implementation toward advanced application reveals that a quarter of samples fulfilled the progression of planning-to- shape integration as well as model production. Furthermore, half of them were able to apply practical knowledge about directions (real physics) into innovative and artistry creations...|$|R

40|$|The {{recycling}} {{technologies of}} textile industry waste usually are adjusted for materials manufactured of uniform fibers. Unfortunately, usually materials are manufactured of blended chemical and natural fibers to achieve better wearing properties, i. e. abrasion resistance, durability and etc. This paper presents investigation about {{the destruction of}} cotton component and easy separation from non-biodegradable polyester. The pre-treatment (soaking in aqueous solutions of reagents) was carried out at different temperatures for blended knitting yarn (50  % cotton / 50  % polyester) waste. The waste was pre-treated by aqueous solutions of reagents: MgCl 2; Al 2 (SO 4) 3, MgCl 2 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3 mixture, MgCl 2 and citric acid mixture at 20, 50, 90 and 130 °C. After the pre-treatment all samples were dried at 102 °C and heat-treated at different temperatures: 150, 160 and 180 °C. The investigation {{results showed that the}} highest degradation rate (95. 47  %) of cotton component from 50  % cotton / 50  % polyester blended knitting <b>yarn</b> <b>waste</b>  was achieved by using the pre-treatment at 20 °C temperature by aqueous solution of 20  g/l MgCl 2 and 4  g/l Al 2 (SO 4) 3 mixture and heat-treatment of dry samples at 180 °C temperature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact on}} the environment of textile products, highlighting that their pollution is primarily exerted on air and water. Textile industry affects the environment through the consumption of water, energy and chemicals, {{as a result of the}} existence of a great number of processes through which fibers are passing until they are transformed into finished products, and the large amount of waste they generate. They may be recoverable (resulting from the spinning phases, <b>yarn</b> <b>waste</b> from spinning mills, weaving mills, knitting, weaving heads and strips from weaving mills and cutting section, patches from the cutting stages etc.) returned to the manufacturing process they can be used to obtain vicuna yarns, non-woven textile fabrics, cotton upholstery for furniture and cars, insulating materials, geotextiles, etc. or irrecoverable – which are incinerated or discarded in landfills - polluting both air and ground. Waste generation involves a loss of materials and energy and imposes high environmental and economic costs to society - of collection, treatment and processing. Therefore we believe that the desire of "zero waste" is currently one of the strategic directions for sustainable development of a society based on knowledge. Suggested solutions to reduce pollution exercised by textiles products various measures were proposed, such as: sound management of waste, recycling and the increase of "green" products in the all textile products...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale weaving {{businesses}} that make production {{in a highly}} competitive environment in textile industry need to properly calculate the unit cost of the products, which they produce or trade, {{in order to survive}} under the market conditions. But as most of the small enterprises in the industry have a workshop-type manufacturing structure on order basis, the cost calculation processes are usually carried out based on professional experiences without a specific method. The main factors that affect the unit cost of fabrics which are woven in enterprises that work on order basis are weaving preparation, raw material, labour, energy and amortization costs. Besides these main cost elements, the incalculable hidden cost factors and the cost factors of <b>yarn</b> <b>waste,</b> product waste and shrinkage ratio must be included in the unit cost calculation. The calculations involving all these elements do not seem possible to be made by the business owners in a continuous, correct and rapid way based on the professional experiences. In this study, software to calculate the unit cost of the products that are manufactured by small weaving enterprises was created and run in a sample application. The interface of this calculation software was created in ASP. NET programming language by using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 application development software. The design of the application is in the level to be viewed in both mobile operating systems and Windows environment...|$|R
40|$|T he textile {{industry}} {{is the largest}} water user and wastewater producer in North Carolina. Typically a large mill will produce over two million gallons of wastewater per day, which is discharged into treatment systems then to the environ-ment. Whether the mill operates its own treatment system or discharges to a pub-liclyowned treatment works(POTW), the cost of treating this pollution is high. In 1980, a large mill reported wastewater treatment operating expenses of over $ 221, 000 (Table I). Mills that discharge to POTW's also pay {{a high price for}} po l luu l t discharges. A summary of charges from typical North Carolina mu-nicipalities (Ealeigh, Rocky Mount, New-ton, Asheville and Fayetteville) is shown in Table 11. Based on these charges, it is not unusual to find even small mills paying $ 10, 000 to $ 50, 000 per month in sewer surcharges. In addition to wastewater treatment costs, large costs are involved in disposal of solid waste. For example, a mill producing one million pounds of woven fabrics per week might consume 6 % on the weight of the goods or 60, 000 pounds of size mate-rial. That would be 600 empty bags per week or 30, 000 bags per year. Beam covers, <b>yarn</b> <b>waste,</b> skinner cones, bobbin cleaning waste, lint and the like are also significant solid wastes. Empty drums, skids and pallets must also be disposed of. Landfill disposal fees of $ 50 to $ 60 per ton are typical. This will increase as existing landfills fill up and new siting, engineering, The economic consequences of pollution from warp sizing and desizing operations are reviewed.
