In the second part (23–28) the decision is described: the king is the major speaker and the one <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> plot.

25|$|Simon Karas (1905–1999) {{began an}} effort to {{assemble}} as much material as possible in order to restore the apparently lost tradition. His work was continued by Lycourgos Angelopoulos and other psaltai (“cantors”) of Byzantine music, until his death 18 May 2014. Two major styles of interpretation have evolved, the Hagioritic, which is simpler and is mainly followed in monasteries, and the Patriarchal, as exemplified by the style taught at the Great Church of Constantinople, which is more elaborate and is practised in parish churches. Nowadays the Orthodox churches maintain chanting schools in which new cantors are trained. Each diocese employs a protopsaltes ("first cantor"), <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> diocesan cathedral choir and supervises musical education and performance. The protopsaltes of the Patriarchates are given the title Archon Protopsaltes ("Lord First Cantor"), a title also conferred as an honorific to distinguished cantors and scholars of Byzantine music.|$|E
25|$|The fourth series, Miracle Day, {{features}} an expanded cast of eight. Barrowman, Myles and Owen all {{return to the}} series. New to the Torchwood team are CIA agents Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), and Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins), and surgeon Vera Juarez (Arlene Tur). American film star Bill Pullman joins as Oswald Danes, a highly intelligent child murderer, and Lauren Ambrose plays Jilly Kitzinger, a ruthless PR woman who takes on Danes as a client. Tur's character is killed off in the fifth episode, whilst Pullman and Havins last until episode ten. Recurring characters include CIA directors Brian Friedkin (Wayne Knight) and Allen Shapiro (John de Lancie), San Pedro camp manager Colin Maloney (Marc Vann), Esther's sister Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), and CIA watch analysts Charlotte Willis (Marina Benedict) and Noah Vickers (Paul James).

The DCNR has named Cherry Springs one of [...] "25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks", specifically for having the [...] "darkest night skies on the east coast". Cherry Springs State Park was featured in the national press in 2003when USA Today named it one of [...] "10Great Places to get some stars in your eyes", in 2006when National Geographic Adventure featured it in [...] "Pennsylvania: The Wild, Wild East", and in The New York Times in 2007.

500|$|Several {{prominent}} scientists {{working in}} the field of neuroscience supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds {{wrote a letter to the}} editor of The Atlantic in which he reiterated that the brain was [...] "very plastic" [...] — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was [...] "not such a long stretch to Carr's meme". One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, Michael Merzenich, later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was [...] "absolutely no question that our brains are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research strategies that are all about 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'". Another neuroscientist, Gary Small, director of UCLA's Memory & Aging Research Center, wrote a letter to the editor of The Atlantic in which he stated that he believed that [...] "brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture".|$|E

2500|$|Other Arabian Nights tales {{deal with}} lost ancient technologies, {{advanced}} ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.

2500|$|After {{arriving}} on the island, the player begins interrogating {{the citizens of}} Solstheim about Miraak. It immediately becomes apparent {{that a majority of}} Solstheim's population has been unconsciously enslaved by Miraak and forced to work on several runic monoliths called [...] "All-Maker Stones", scattered across the island. Among the unaffected observers is a wizard, Neloth, <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> player to the Temple of Miraak. The player reaches the Temple and encounters a Nord named Frea, who is immune to Miraak's control, attempting in vain to break his spell over her people, the Skaal. She accompanies the player into the Temple. Inside, the player discovers a [...] "Black Book", and after reading it, is unwittingly transported into a realm of Oblivion called Apocrypha, where they witness Miraak planning his invasion of Tamriel. Miraak dismisses the player as inferior and returns them to Solstheim.|$|E
2500|$|Defensive {{positions}} {{are often the}} same, but just switched from offence to defence. For example, the centre forward or hole set, <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> attack on offence, on defence is known as [...] "hole D" [...] (also known as set guard, hole guard, hole check, pit defence or two-metre defence), and guards the opposing team's centre forward (also called the hole). Defence can be played man-to-man or in zones, such as a 2–4 (four defenders along the goal line). It can also be played as {{a combination of the}} two in what is known as an [...] "M drop" [...] defence, in which the point defender moves away ("sloughs off") his man into a zone in order to better defend the centre position. In this defence, the two wing defenders split the area furthest from the goal, allowing them a clearer lane for the counter-attack if their team recovers the ball.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} stories within the One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) also feature science fiction elements. One example is [...] "The Adventures of Bulukiya", where the protagonist Bulukiya's {{quest for the}} herb of {{immortality}} leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, {{and other forms of}} life. In another Arabian Nights tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other Arabian Nights tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. [...] "The City of Brass" [...] features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> party towards the ancient city. [...] "The Ebony Horse" [...] features a robot {{in the form of a}} flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the [...] "Third Qalandar's Tale" [...] also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. [...] "The City of Brass" [...] and [...] "The Ebony Horse" [...] can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.|$|E

Other Arabian Nights tales also depict Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. [...] "The City of Brass" [...] features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot <b>who</b> <b>directs</b> <b>the</b> party towards the ancient city, which {{has now become a}} ghost town. [...] "The Ebony Horse" [...] features a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun. Some modern interpretations see this horse as a robot. The titular ebony horse can fly the distance of one year in a single day, and is used as a vehicle by the Prince of Persia, Qamar al-Aqmar, in his adventures across Persia, Arabia and Byzantium.
