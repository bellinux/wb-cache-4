5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents persuaded him {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music.

Meyer's idea for the effect <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>The</b> Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Like capital, {{the end of}} proto-globalization {{was filled}} with {{mobility}} of individuals. The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”. Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during World War I. Between 1750-1880, the expansion of worldwide integration <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.|$|E
5|$|Like its art, Palmyra's {{architecture}} <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greco-Roman style, {{while preserving}} local elements (best {{seen in the}} Temple of Bel). Enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville.

Musically, No Depression <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

40|$|The {{slope of}} the plasma density {{gradient}} at <b>the</b> separatrix <b>is</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> curvature of the density profile in the scrape-off layer (SOL). This curvature is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parallel flow loss rate and the ionization rate in <b>the</b> SOL, which <b>are</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> neutral gas density and electron heating in that region. The radial electric field <b>is</b> also <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ion pressure gradient just inside the separatrix. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
5|$|One art {{historian}} suggests the painting <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> works of Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet, while another believes it was informed {{by those of}} the satirists William Hogarth and Honoré Daumier. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.|$|E

5|$|The Western Ganga {{style of}} {{architecture}} <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, {{in addition to}} indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features inherited from the Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky says <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat {{and close to}} the screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of Gregory {{is that he}} was {{an orthodox}} Trinitarian theologian, who <b>was</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> neoplatonism of Plotinus and believed in universal salvation following Origen. However, as a highly original and sophisticated thinker, Gregory is difficult to classify, and many aspects of his theology are contentious among both conservative Eastern Orthodox theologians and Western academic scholarship. This is often {{due to the lack of}} systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory's work.|$|E
50|$|The {{declaration}} of an organizational context and commitment protocols <b>were</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Language Action Perspective, as developed by Fernando Flores and Terry Winograd.
