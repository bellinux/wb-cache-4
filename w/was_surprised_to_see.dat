5|$|The {{film was}} chosen among 15 debut {{works for the}} 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It {{received}} enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E

5|$|In early December 1808, Topaze {{departed}} Brest and travelled {{across the}} Atlantic, encountering the British frigate HMS Loire in the Bay of Biscay. Loire fired on Topaze, {{but was unable}} to catch her and, despite minor damage, the French ship was able to reach the Caribbean without further incident. Nearing Cayenne on 13 January 1809, Lahalle <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the small British ship HMS Confiance emerge from the harbour and manoeuvre threateningly towards his ship. Realising that Cayenne was in British hands, he turned and sailed northwards, concerned that stronger British forces might be nearby. In fact Confiance was the only British ship in the vicinity and she was severely underarmed, with a crew of just 47 men, including 20 local inhabitants recruited on the spot. The colony had been captured just three days earlier by a combined British and Portuguese expeditionary force under Captain James Lucas Yeo.|$|E

25|$|When Tarmo {{returned}} to Tallinn, her crew <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another large icebreaker flying the Finnish flag moored at the harbour. The Soviet icebreaker Volynets {{had been captured}} only two days earlier and renamed Wäinämöinen. Both ships were used to transport 3,000 German soldiers — Detachment Brandenstein — to Loviisa. On 18 April 1918, Tarmo arrived in Helsinki and was handed back to the Finnish Board of Navigation.|$|E
25|$|Antonino Calderone, narrating his {{initiation}} {{ritual in}} Catania in 1962, recalls that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at the gathering people he knew {{and he never}} suspected were in the Mafia, and not to see people he thought were in the organization.

25|$|In 246, Lu Kang was {{promoted}} to General of the Household (中郎將) and ordered to switch posts with Zhuge Ke – he would leave Wuchang and move to Chaisang (柴桑) while Zhuge Ke would do vice versa. Before Lu Kang left, he had the city walls repaired and his residence renovated while leaving his fruit orchards intact. When Zhuge Ke arrived in Chaisang, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Lu Kang had left behind a well-maintained residence for him. He also felt ashamed because his garrison at Chaisang was in poor condition when he departed.|$|E
25|$|Deng {{arrived in}} France on October 19, 1920, but {{within three months}} the Sichuan Association which {{sponsored}} his trip ran out of money. Deng then worked at Schneider & Co., France's largest ordnance manufacturer, in Creusot, a southern city. Deng <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> white people treat Chinese like slaves in Shanghai and other ports along the way. Although he {{and many of his}} Chinese colleagues had considered themselves economically well off in China, they now worked long hours in poor conditions while they saw French families living in luxury unknown in China. Deng learned how to use an industrial welder, a skill which proved useful when he was deposed from power during the Cultural Revolution and sent to work in a factory.|$|E

25|$|After Henry’s death Marie {{struggled}} {{to stay on}} at the chateau during the Second World War years when Axis forces took over the grounds. Marie lived in the gatehouse and managed to preserve much of Henry’s art along with chateau relics by burying them in the expansive gardens. When the Allied forces liberated the village Marie <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the troops were led by one of her cousins, an American officer. After the war Henry’s art was re-displayed at the chateau and in 1993 the facility became designated as a historic monument administered under the French Ministry of Culture. Today {{it is one of}} the leading attractions in the region and the art of Henry Clews Jr. is on continuous public exhibition.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{while he}} was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese {{soldiers}} who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin then put the uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} to come he was {{reported}} to be on the wish lists of many top European clubs; his former All Black's teammate Andrew Mehrtens was forced to publicly deny rumours that Umaga was a target of his club at the time – Harlequins. Umaga eventually signed for French club Toulon that had been recently relegated from the Top 14 to Pro D2. His contract allowed him to play the entire 2006 Air New Zealand Cup (ANZ Cup) season for Wellington before travelling to France. He ended up playing only seven matches for Toulon as Wellington made the ANZ Cup final. He nonetheless made roughly €350,000 (US$438,000/GBP 250,000) that Toulon's co-presidents reportedly paid out of their own pockets. The day before playing his first match for Toulon he was awarded the medal of honour of the city of Toulon (médaille d'or de la ville) by Mayor Hubert Falco. On 29 October 2006, Umaga started in his first game three days after arriving in Toulon scoring his team's only try in a 22–16 victory against Lyon. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how close to the players the fans were and how noisy the atmosphere was.|$|E
25|$|Ellen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin {{would be}} {{thousands}} of miles away from her for what was sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from New York on February 19, 1858 aboard the Star of the West, along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy. After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in Kingston, Jamaica, where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in Panama, and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the Sonora. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.|$|E
