50|$|This is ancient {{woodland}} {{on heavy}} clay, with mature oak and ash trees, and an understorey of hazel and field maple. The ground flora is diverse, including wild <b>garlic,</b> <b>wood</b> anemones and bluebells.|$|R
50|$|Vampyres: One of {{the most}} common races of Kin, vampyres Drain by feeding on the blood of their victims. They are {{vulnerable}} to sunlight, running water, <b>garlic,</b> <b>wood,</b> fire, and holy relics. They can also infect humans, turning them into vampires, and must sleep on a bed of earth taken from the land in which they were buried.|$|R
50|$|The hedgerow {{supports}} a diverse woodland flora which includes wood anemone, bluebell, ramsons (<b>wood</b> <b>garlic),</b> nettle-leaved bellflower and wood millet. The hedge comprises hawthorn, buckthorn, dogwood, hazel, ash, spindle and traveller's-joy. The fields support grassland flowers such as common fleabane, agrimony, cuckooflower, marjoram and bulbous buttercup.|$|E
50|$|A good ground flora {{is present}} {{mostly in the}} {{broad-leaved}} areas. Bluebell, Yellow Archangel, Wood Anemone, Moschatel, Early-purple Orchid and Ramsons (<b>wood</b> <b>garlic).</b> There are Roman Snails in a site of a Roman Settlement {{in the north of}} the wood. The Common Dormouse is present as are Roe and Muntjac deer.|$|E
50|$|There {{are areas}} of hawthorn, hazel, ash, pedunculate oak, holly and {{blackthorn}} scrub. Toothwort, nettle-leaved bellflower, woodruff and sanicle {{may be found}} in these areas. A stream, edged with trees and shrubs, runs along the bottom of the banks where meadowsweet, ramsons (<b>wood</b> <b>garlic),</b> brooklime and water figwort may be found.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} part of Fox Reservoir, which was opened in 1888 and drained in 1943 to prevent it {{being used as a}} navigational aid for German bombers in World War II. The area was {{acquired}} by the Municipal Borough of Ealing in 1949 for public open space. Part of it is ancient woodland, and other areas are on the sloping area of the drained reservoir. It has a variety of plant species, including wood anemones, <b>wood</b> avens and <b>garlic</b> mustard.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{an example}} of ancient Beech woodland, which is typical of the Jurassic {{limestone}} of the west Cotswolds. Kingscote, Horsley and Sandgrove woods are similar and includes some Ash and Oak. The woodland understorey is Hazel and Hawthorn. These are Bluebell woods with <b>Wood</b> <b>Garlic,</b> Wood Anemone and Dog's Mercury.|$|E
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{is available from the}} Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. Typical woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, early-purple orchid, primrose, ramsons (<b>wood</b> <b>garlic),</b> common dog-violet and yellow archangel. Uncommon species are meadow saffron, herb-paris, common cow-wheat, bitter-vetch and violet helleborine. The grassy rides support betony, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, common spotted-orchid, greater knapweed, greater butterfly-orchid, cowslip and yellow-rattle. The damper rides supports lesser spearwort, ragged-robin, marsh ragwort, brooklime and various sedges and rushes.|$|E
50|$|Allium ursinum - {{known as}} ramsons, buckrams, wild garlic, {{broad-leaved}} garlic, <b>wood</b> <b>garlic,</b> bear leek, or bear's garlic - is a wild relative of chives native to Europe and Asia. The Latin name {{is due to}} the brown bear's taste for the bulbs and its habit of digging up the ground to get at them; they are also a favourite of wild boar. In Europe, where ramsons are popularly harvested from the wild, similarity to poisonous plants such as lily of the valley or Colchicum autumnale regularly leads to cases of poisoning.|$|E
5000|$|A stunted {{woodland}} {{grows on}} a landslip {{from the top}} of the cliff (...) down to sea-level. Exposure to salt-laden winds has resulted in a tight wind-pruned canopy with trees from 1 to 8 metre high. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is the dominant species with pedunculate oak (Q. robur), birch (Betula spp), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and a few wild-service trees (Sorbus torminalis). Many of the trees are swathed in lichens and moss with 131 species of lichen recorded and there are a number of species that are largely confined to a few north Cornwall and Devon sites. One hundred and twenty flowering plants have been found including, bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), heath pearlwort (Sagina subulata), primrose (Primula vulgaris), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), small bristle club rush (Isolepis setacea), wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), <b>wood</b> <b>garlic</b> (Allium ursinum) and wood vetch (Vicia sylvatica). Damp areas are dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and the ferns broad buckler fern (Dryopteris dilatata) and royal fern (Osmunda regalis) are abundant. The hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) is of interest. There was a heronry here in the first decades of the 20th-century.|$|E
40|$|Allium sativum {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in medicine. While much is known about its potential healthy effects, nearly nothing is known about wild garlic (allium sativum, ramson), which is very common in the area of Leipzig and {{has been used as a}} herbal remedy since centuries. The goal of the present study was to assess a potential anti-platelet activity of these two allium species and to try to identify the chemical active principle. For that purpose various extracts (hydrophilic and lipophilic) were prepared from Allium sativum and Allium ursinum, and analysed using thin layer chromatography and HPLC. After identifying an active, i. e. antiaggregatory extract (see below), this was fractionated and the active fraction was further sub-fractionated for subsequent chemical analysis by mass spectroscopy, ESI (Electrospray ionization), and COSY (Correlation effect spectroscopy), and functional testing. Anti-platelet activity was assessed in human platelets (platelet rich plasma) using a classical turbidimetric method. Platelets were stimulated with various agonists (arachidonic acid, ADP, epinephrine, collagen, A 23187) with and without the addition of the extracts or the fractions /sub-fractions. Both Allium Ursinum and Allium sativum extracts exert antiaggregatory effects with EC 50 values around 0. 1 mg/ml. The garlic extracts are acting by inhibition of the ADP pathway comparable as known from the clinically used drug clopidegrol. The pharmacological active antiaggregatory component of the extracts appears to be lipophilic rather than hydrophilic. This is the first report on an antiplatelet activity of Allium Ursinum. One final structure determined by HPLC, MS, ESI and COSY which exerts the antiplatelets inhibitory effect is β-sitosterol- 3 -O-β-D-glucoside of the fraction 7 - 14 crystals. It is considered that about three up to five grams of dried leaves might be enough to exert antiaggregatory effects (comment: in pharmacy normally dried plant material is used in therapy). The second compound with antiaggregatory activity was identified as 1 -β-D-galactopyranoside- 2, 3 -bis-linolenic glycerate. The problem of loosing the active volatile oily components by drying the leaves in future studies looking for the clinical use may be solved by looking for a raw or a refined extract which would be the form of a real phytomedical drug; for example capsules about 120 to 200 micrograms of an alcoholic or better an heptane / oily extract gained from <b>wood</b> <b>garlic</b> leaves would be an useful drug formulation to reach respective concentrations in blood. However, we have to admit that since our investigations were in-vitro, the in-vivo situation is somewhat different due to the metabolism, which is nearly unknown. Nevertheless, this study shows for the first time that allium ursinum does exert anti-platelet activity and that both allium species can unfold antiaggregatory effects which are worth to be investigated in subsequent in-vivo studies. β-sitosterol- 3 -O-β-D-glucoside and 1 -β-D-galactopyranoside- 2, 3 -bis-linolenic glycerate could be identified as active antiaggregatory principals...|$|E
