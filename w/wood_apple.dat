2500|$|Sloth {{bears are}} expert hunters of termites, which they locate by smell. On {{arriving}} at a mound, they scrape at the structure with their claws till they reach the large combs {{at the bottom of}} the galleries, and disperse the soil with violent puffs. The termites are then sucked up through the muzzle, producing a sucking sound which can be heard 180 m away. Their sense of smell is strong enough to detect grubs 3ft below ground. Unlike other bears, they do not congregate in feeding groups. They rarely prey on other mammals. Sloth bears may supplement their diets with fruit and plant matter; in March and April, they eat the fallen petals of mowha trees and are partial to mangoes, sugar cane, jackfruit, and the pods of the golden shower tree. Sloth bears are extremely fond of honey. When feeding their cubs, sows are reported to regurgitate a mixture of half-digested jack fruit, <b>wood</b> <b>apples,</b> and pieces of honeycomb. This sticky substance hardens into a dark yellow, circular, bread-like mass which is fed to the cubs. This [...] "bear's bread" [...] is considered a delicacy by some of India's natives.|$|R

50|$|A {{major benefit}} of pellet grills {{is that the}} pellets are both the fuel source for cooking and a flavor {{enhancer}} that infuses food with wood fired taste. Because of their small size and composition, food-grade pellets burn cleanly, producing a light smoky flavor that people associate with traditional BBQ and wood-fire ovens. Popular varieties include apple, cherry, hickory, pecan, and mesquite that each impart their own distinct taste, and can complement and highlight the flavors of specific foods.For instance, fruit <b>woods</b> like <b>apple</b> and cherry pair well with fish and poultry, while hickory and mesquite go well with beef.|$|R

40|$|Poplar crates {{are widely}} used in contact with foodstuffs. One of the major markets for poplar crates is apple packaging. As a direct food contact material, wood is subject to European {{regulation}} no 1935 / 2004, which requires no negative effect of material or packaging on foodstuffs. This study aims to quantify the transfer of Penicillium expansum conidia and Escherichia coli from poplar specimens to Golden apples. This [microorganisms-poplar-Golden apple] model was developed taking into account realistic parameters with extreme and usual conditions. Poplar specimens were artificially contaminated with P. expansum and E. coli. They were then put in contact with apples and stored in a climatic room for up to one week. Both <b>wood</b> specimens and <b>apples</b> were analyzed to assess the survival of microorganisms on wood specimens {{and the proportion of}} microorganism transfer to apples. Whereas P. expansum conidia survived but did not grow on wood specimens, E. coli mortality was observed after one hour of contact with wood. The proportion of both microorganisms transferred to apples was less than 0. 25 %. The impact of wood moisture content, contact time between <b>wood</b> and <b>apples,</b> and apple supply variability on the transfer levels were studied. The hygroscopic properties of wood were discussed. The low and reproducible transfer levels observed demonstrate that poplar is a safe packaging material for apples...|$|R
