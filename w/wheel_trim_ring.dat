5000|$|Announced 16 October 1956, the 105R and 105S used a high-output, 8.5:1 {{compression}} {{version of}} the 2.6 L engine used in the 90. The higher compression was {{to take advantage of}} the higher octane fuel that had become widely available. This twin-SU carburettor engine produced 108 hp (80 kW). [...] Both 105 models also featured the exterior changes of the rest of the range announced a month earlier. The 105S featured separate front seats, a cigar lighter, chromed <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> <b>rings</b> and twin Lucas SFT 576 spotlamps.

5000|$|Next {{came the}} SL-Class 230 SL, a new design with a 2.3-litre {{mechanically}} fuel injected six cylinder engine. It featured a low waistline and big curved greenhouse windows, and a Coupe Roadster with detachable hardtop, whose distinctive roofline earned the nickname [...] "pagoda top." [...] The design was by Paul Bracq. Around 1967, the engine received a displacement increase {{and the model}} {{became known as the}} 250 SL. Within a year the engine displacement was increased for the final time and the model designation became 280 SL. Beginning with later versions of the 250 SL changes were made to dashboard padding, switches and knobs, door pockets (US models only) and steering wheel.

25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|R
2500|$|The Gremlin X {{version was}} added in 1976 as a {{separate}} model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger [...] I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the [...] "Navajo" [...] pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.|$|R
5000|$|The sporty Diablo package {{began in}} 1978 as an {{equivalent}} to the El Camino's Royal Knight package (which was, in turn, an upgrade from the long-running Super Sport package). Both the Royal Knight and the Diablo carried a hood graphic not unlike that featured on the Pontiac Trans Am; the Diablo's was in a symmetrical flame pattern that resembled a demon. Besides the hood accents, Diablo also came with lower-body accent paint, body-color mirrors, black-trimmed window frames, a front air dam, color-matched [...] "Rally" [...] steel <b>wheels</b> with <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> and a large [...] "Diablo" [...] decal on the tailgate.|$|R

Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|R
2500|$|For 1979 all {{versions}} of the American came with the redesigned aluminum bumpers with plastic side end caps, dual quad headlights over a transparent parking light, and the [...] "waterflow" [...] plastic grille. The station wagon with automatic transmission obtained a new designation and became the Camioneta American DL. The American GFS got a treatment more similar to its AMC counterpart with {{the removal of the}} targa band retaining the Landau half-vinyl top. The side opera windows were changed to fixed units, which incorporated a unique VAM-designed sandblasted GFS emblem. Both the base and high-trim versions incorporated a shared new design of side panels, the only difference between them being a low carpet insert for the top-end models. All units with column-mounted shifters and automatic transmission obtained a new gear indicator integrated into the speedometer, replacing the previous unit fixed on top of the steering column. The flip-style digital clock was replaced by a quartz electronic one. The list of optional equipment was expanded with the possibility of ordering a monaural AM FM radio on the three high trim versions. For some reason, no wheelcovers were offered this year, thus the luxury editions incorporated bright narrow volcano hubcaps with VAM a logo and <b>wheel</b> <b>trim</b> <b>rings.</b> The custom steering wheel got a new design for the year with a soft rectangular button and tiny metal VAM emblem.|$|R

However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models.

2500|$|A {{new model}} called [...] "The Judge" [...] was introduced. The name {{came from a}} comedy routine, [...] "Here Come de Judge", used {{repeatedly}} on the Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In TV show. The Judge routine, made popular by comedian Flip Wilson, was borrowed from the act of long-time burlesque entertainer Dewey [...] "Pigmeat" [...] Markham. Advertisements used slogans like [...] "All rise for the Judge" [...] and [...] "The Judge can be bought". As originally conceived, the Judge {{was to be a}} low-cost GTO, stripped of features to make it competitive with the Plymouth Road Runner. The package was US$332 more expensive than a standard GTO, and included the Ram Air III engine, Rally II <b>wheels</b> without <b>trim</b> <b>rings,</b> Hurst shifter (with a unique T-shaped handle), wider tires, various decals, and a rear spoiler. Pontiac claimed that the spoiler had some functional effect at higher speeds, producing a small but measurable downforce, but it was of little value at legal speeds. The Judge was initially offered only in Carousel Red, but midway into the model year a variety of other colors became available.|$|R

The headliner was changed to a cloth-wrapped unit. VAM started using {{for the first time}} the net rating system for measuring the output of its engines.

A total of 369 VAM Pacers were sold.|$|R
