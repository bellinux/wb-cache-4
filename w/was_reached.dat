The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement <b>was</b> <b>reached</b> between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E

It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>is</b> 3n-2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> It <b>is</b> considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).|$|R

At 09:10, when the front <b>was</b> <b>reached,</b> Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires.
