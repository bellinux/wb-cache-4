40|$|For this artist's book, Dimitri Vangrunderbeek {{carefully}} placed old {{mirrors and}} glass from second-hand table tops -often large, heavy and fragile- on drying paper, and subsequently traced {{them with a}} pencil. A 10 -metre long drawing of partly overlapping tracings was used to connect to the space of Vangrunderbeek's studio. It was laid out on <b>working</b> <b>tables</b> across the three rooms of his studio on a structure of hardboard sheets. In an attempt to connect the drawing to space, a couple of mirrors were again positioned on the tracings and were partly traced with a cutter. When cutting out forms from the drawing, the hardboard appeared through the paper. When cutting further across the hardboard, fragments of tabletops of the supporting <b>working</b> <b>tables</b> and fragments of the studio floor became visible. A selection of tables, objects and sculptures present in Vangrunderbeek's studio was used to compose {{the views of the}} different holes in the drawing, with the intention of accentuating the essences of their formal and material qualities. status: publishe...|$|R

Elinor, who saw as plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to her liking. Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said, ...|$|E

The cohort calculations are based on stochastic projections of mortality coupled with alternative assumptions about future participation rates. Separate tables are provided for the years 1976, 1991, and 2006, thus spanning a period of substantial gains in life expectancy and strong upward trends in female participation. cohort <b>working</b> life <b>tables...</b>|$|R

50|$|Perhaps Donati’s most {{remarkable}} ability is his mastery of color. In his studio he had four palettes. Two were in use on his <b>working</b> <b>table,</b> one for earth colors {{and one for}} the high tones. Hanging behind the easel were two more, each with a kaleidoscope of colors. When asked the reason, Donati replied, “I keep those palettes above the easel as a record of colors, otherwise I forget them. Color is too important to depend on trial and error. I see a color on one of those palettes, put in on the picture in my mind’s eye, and this prevents me from making mistakes.” It is thus with meticulous care that Donati achieved the purity and vivacity of color, the apparent spontaneity which distinguish his paintings.|$|E

In 1908, permanent installations of the biological station were established with the main laboratory, a residence building, and an attic. There were long <b>working</b> <b>tables,</b> and storage area for materials and supplies. Dr. Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman was the Curator from 1912 to 1921 and Director from 1921 until 1933. The main lab was destroyed by fire in 1932 and replaced the following year by a fireproof lab, part of the complex that houses the SABS' library. After establishing the first freshwater biological research station in Canada at Gimli, Manitoba in 1929, the fisheries biologist Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov came to work at SABS in the 1930s.

She draws from memory - as she lives with horses she can observe their attitudes and expressions - and uses her equestrian knowledge. She thinks that horses are not easy animals to depict. The slightest alteration of proportion and all the drawing goes wrong. She thinks that, would she use a photography, her drawing would lack life and movement.

Living with horses is the right approach : thus she can capture {{the shape of the}} animal she then reproduces.|$|E
