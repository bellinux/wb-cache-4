5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{one of the largest and}} most populous European states, <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a pawn of its neighbors (the Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria), who interfered in its domestic politics almost at will. In the second half of the 18th century, the Commonwealth was repeatedly partitioned by the neighboring powers and ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} years the league <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a formal {{agreement}} between teams to play {{each other and to}} declare a champion at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|The West {{responded with}} the Crusades, {{eventually}} {{resulting in the}} Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented {{what remained of the}} Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.|$|E

5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft manned by ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s {{to the point where}} it was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke {{is an old}} {{market town}} {{expanded}} in the mid 1960s {{as a result of}} an agreement between London County Council and Hampshire County Council. It was developed rapidly after World War II, along with various other towns in the United Kingdom, in order to accommodate part of the London 'overspill' as perceived under the Greater London Plan in 1944. Basingstoke market was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and it remained a small market town until the early 1960s. At the start of World War II the population <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 13,000. It still has a regular market, but is now larger than Hampshire County Council's definition of a market town.|$|E

A smaller impact crater has merged into the southern rim; the northern rim <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than an irregular, arcing range of ridges.

5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|When NY280 was {{originally}} assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a short spur route off of NY17 that followed the Allegheny River south to the hamlet of Quaker Bridge. In 1965, the Kinzua Dam was completed, leading {{to the creation of the}} Allegheny Reservoir and the inundation of much of NY280. As a result, the route was shifted onto a new alignment that was constructed along the eastern edge of the reservoir.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, {{the crisis}} of the Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued {{at the beginning of the}} century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.|$|E
5|$|Charles and the Duke of Buckingham, James's {{favourite}} {{and a man}} who {{had great}} influence over the prince, travelled incognito to Spain in February 1623 to try to reach agreement on the long-pending Spanish match. In the end, however, the trip was an embarrassing failure. The Infanta thought Charles <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than an infidel, and the Spanish at first demanded that he convert to Roman Catholicism as a condition of the match. The Spanish insisted on toleration of Catholics in England and the repeal of the penal laws, which Charles knew would never be agreed by Parliament, and that the Infanta remain in Spain for a year after any wedding to ensure that England complied with all the terms of the treaty. A personal quarrel erupted between Buckingham and the Count of Olivares, the Spanish chief minister, and so Charles conducted the ultimately futile negotiations personally. When Charles returned to London in October, without a bride and to a rapturous and relieved public welcome, he and Buckingham pushed a reluctant King James to declare war on Spain.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Bruichladdich Radical {{competed in}} the entire LMS season. Having retired at the opening event, the 1000 km of Monza, the team took a ninth place overall finish and third in class at the 1000 km of Valencia; in the latter race, Greaves and Moseley were joined by Robin Liddell. Following this event, the team participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time, however, Tim Greaves crashed out after 90 minutes, forcing the team to withdraw. The {{following}} LMS race, which was the 1000km of Nürburgring, <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> successful; Greaves and Moseley finished 35th, and ninth in class, after a starter motor problem had cost the team around 30 minutes. A retirement at the 1000 km of Spa followed, due to engine failure after 81 laps, before the season finale, the 1000 km of Silverstone saw the team take 14th overall and seventh in class; Jacob Greaves filling the third driver's slot for the team. The team finished joint-eighth in the LMP2 team's standings; level with Team LNT and Kruse Motorsport on eight points.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav {{returned}} to Bulgaria in force, accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents. In his absence, Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II; the Bulgarian defenders {{put up a}} determined fight, but Sviatoslav stormed the city. Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated, and the Rus' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria, placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav. There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav's vassal. In reality he <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a figurehead, retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at and reaction to the Rus' presence. Sviatoslav {{appears to have been}} successful in enlisting Bulgarian support. Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers, tempted partly by the prospects of booty, but also enticed by Sviatoslav's anti-Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage. The Rus' ruler himself was careful not to alienate his new subjects: he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully.|$|E
5|$|NATO <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a {{political}} association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built {{up under the}} direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength {{of the relationship between the}} European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 March, another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour: five LSTs, each towing an LCM, with the 12th Cavalry and other units and {{equipment}} including five Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVTs) of the 592ndEBSR, three M3 light tanks of the 603rd Tank Company, and twelve 105mm howitzers of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The 12thCavalry was ordered to follow the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the Salami Plantation. The road to Salami <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged. The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches, felled trees, snipers, and booby traps. WO2 R.J. Booker of ANGAU used his local knowledge to guide the 12th Cavalry and the three tanks to Salami. Here the Japanese put up a fierce fight that lasted over an hour. The tanks fired canister shot shells into buildings and high-explosive shells into the slits of Japanese bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} record contains few details of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from the {{historical record}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} cast of Last of the Summer Wine {{also included}} a handful of characters with whom the trio regularly interacted. Kathy Staff was chosen to play Compo's neighbour, Nora Batty. Gilbert was initially sceptical about casting Staff but changed his mind after she padded herself to look bigger and read from a scene between her character and Owen's. This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio: John Comer and Jane Freeman as Sid and Ivy, the quarrelling husband-and-wife owners of the local café; and Blake Butler and Rosemary Martin as Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge, the librarians having a not-so-secret affair. Butler and Martin, however, were dropped as major characters after the first series. According to Peter Sallis, Roy Clarke felt there <b>was</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> he could do with them.|$|E
