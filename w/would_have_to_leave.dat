5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers were available to protect the barrage, the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Napoleon {{tried to}} force Louis XVIII to renounce his right to the throne of France, but Louis refused. In May 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte {{declared}} himself Emperor of the French. Louis XVIII and his nephew departed for Sweden in July for a Bourbon family conference, where Louis XVIII, the comte d'Artois, and the duc d'AngoulÃªme issued a statement condemning Napoleon's decision to declare himself emperor. The King of Prussia issued a proclamation saying that Louis XVIII <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Prussian territory, which meant leaving Warsaw. Alexander I of Russia invited Louis XVIII to resume residence in Jelgava. Louis XVIII had to live under less generous conditions than those enjoyed under Paul I, and he intended to embark for England as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
50|$|As for Soviet-German {{relationship}} during 1940, Meltyukhov {{points out}} that although both sides had the common goal of weakening Britain and negotiations were held in November 1940, an actual military alliance was never realised, for Soviets <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the whole continent to the German-Italian sphere of influence, i.e., relegating the Soviets to a second-rate {{role in the world}} matters.|$|R

25|$|As Geldof {{began to}} learn more about the situation, he {{discovered}} that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks.

25|$|Tennessee {{took the}} second half kickoff, and {{executed}} a 12-play, 45-yard drive {{which resulted in a}} 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review.|$|E

However, he reversed the pin at a two count and rolled Sable into a small package, winning the match via pinfall. This forced Sable to leave the WWF.|$|E
25|$|Kyary {{was raised}} in a {{traditional}} strict household, where her parents frequently set early curfews and limited her cell phone access. Her mother was very critical of her fashion sense, to the point where Kyary <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the house dressed normally, and change into Harajuku-style clothing inside a public restroom. She would often return home to find that her mother had disposed of her fashion accessories, which led to further quarrels. She writes in her autobiography, Oh! My God!! Harajuku Girl that her father was more supportive of her, although they had their fair share of quarrels as well.|$|E

25|$|In the 1800s the {{continental}} railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897 construction opened on a spur {{line of the}} Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon; by 1901 the line was open. During {{his visit to the}} Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Indian Garden. Roosevelt told them about the park that was being created, and that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the area. In 1908 the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Indian Garden, forced out by the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|On the October 2 {{edition of}} Nitro, Vince Russo, an {{authority}} figure, made Bill Goldberg begin an undefeated streak. If Goldberg exceeded his previous streak of over 170 matches, {{he would be}} awarded {{a shot at the}} WCW World Heavyweight Championship. If he failed to do so, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the company. Goldberg continued his streak, and Lex Luger challenged him on the October 30 edition of Nitro, starting their feud. Goldberg defeated Luger in a match at Mayhem. A rematch was made between them at Starrcade, and Luger attacked Goldberg on the following shows with a steel chair. The Sarge, who was credited for training Goldberg, also joined the feud, and aligned with Goldberg. Luger attacked The Sarge several times to taunt Goldberg.|$|E
25|$|The Slovenian Ice Hockey League did {{not have}} a high enough skill level, so Kopitar decided that if he wanted to improve his career prospects, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country. He was offered a chance to play in Sweden for SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje SK, {{eventually}} joining their junior team where he led the League in scoring, with 49 points (28 goals, 21 assists) in 30 games. Prior to the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Kopitar was ranked the top European skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. After his first season in Sweden, he was chosen 11th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 2005 Draft. Unlike most top-ranked prospects, Kopitar was not at the draft, but in Sweden playing in preseason games. Some members of the team had a party for the draft, including Niclas Bergfors, who was selected 23rd overall by the New Jersey Devils. Prior to the NHL Draft, Kopitar was also selected in the CHL Import Draft by the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He declined to move to North America, however, hoping to further his development by continuing to play against professionals in the Elitserien, rather than against major junior players in the WHL.|$|E
50|$|Other historians {{take the}} {{contrary}} view that Zosimuss account was broadly correct {{and that the}} SHAs attempt to involve Marcianus was an exercise in misdirection. They argue that that author of that work intended to refute any suggestion that Claudius might {{have been involved in}} a treasonable conspiracy against a legitimate Emperor, even one so contemptible as Gallienus, because he was, in fact, guilty of just that. They point out that this was a matter of present concern when the SHA were writing because Claudius was the proclaimed ancestor of the ruling Constantinian Dynasty. For these historians the very suggestion that Marcianus was actually present at Mediolanium is suspect given the silence of Zosimus and the grave state of affairs he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> behind him in Illyricum.|$|R

25|$|International law {{allowed the}} German ship a stay of 24 hours before she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> or be interned and her captain claimed that his engines were {{disabled}} which extended the deadline to eight days. In the meantime, Kent had summoned Glasgow {{and the two}} ships entered Cumberland Bay in the island {{on the morning of}} 14 March and found Dresden at anchor. The German ship trained her guns on the British ships and Glasgow opened fire, Captain John Luce justifying his action by deeming it an unfriendly act by an interned ship that had frequently violated Chilean neutrality. Dresden hoisted a white flag four minutes later as she was already on fire and holed at her waterline. A boat brought Lieutenant Wilhelm Canaris to Glasgow to complain that his ship was under Chilean protection. Luce told him that the question of neutrality could be settled by diplomats and that he would destroy the German ship unless she surrendered. By the time that Canaris returned to Dresden, her crew had finished preparations for scuttling and abandoned ship after opening her Kingston valves. It took 20 minutes before the cruiser capsized to port and sank. The British shells had killed one midshipman and eight sailors and wounded three officers and twelve enlisted men.|$|E
25|$|The {{regular season}} {{concluded}} with the match in Columbus, {{and the result}} matched the all-time worst in United's team history. The United attack hardly ever threatened, but it was shoddy work by the back line that really did in the team, as a 5-0 loss dropped the team into 4th place. That left United as host for a midweek 'play-in' match at home against a New England Revolution team that finished {{the season with a}} convincing 3-1 win at NYCFC. On a rainy day in the D.C. area, one of the smallest crowds of the year turned out to watch what proved {{to be one of the}} most entertaining games in the MLS season. Typical of the 2015 edition of the team, D.C. United fell behind in the first 15 minutes, but it was hard to fault the quality of a spectacular bicycle goal by New England's Juan Agudelo. Following the goal, the Revolution continued to press but Hamid was able to keep United in the match with some big saves. United leveled the score on a free kick in the 45th minute, as Pontius scored on a header set-up by Espindola's service. Pontius <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the game in the second half, due to hamstring tightness. The D.C. team missed a chance to go ahead in the 75th minute, when Rolfe failed to convert a penalty kick, striking the inside of the post. Rolfe, however, got redemption, scoring in the 83rd minute, finishing off a cutback centering pass from Espindola, DeLeon was also credited with an assist for his nifty back-heel that set-up Espindola's run to the end line. Another spectacular save by Hamid denied a header bid by Revolution's Jermaine Jones in the late-going. The game ended on a controversial note, as Jermaine Jones was shown a red card for grabbing the referee while protesting the decision not to award a penalty kick for an apparent handball against United defender Sean Franklin in the 92nd minute. United had led the league with 8 comeback victories during the regular season, so the comeback win was a fitting way to kick off the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs.|$|E
