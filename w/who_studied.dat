5|$|Impressed with Abovian's {{thirst for}} knowledge, Parrot {{arranged}} for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830. He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied in the Philosophy faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836. The years in Dorpat were very fruitful for Abovian <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and Latin. At this time Abovian fell {{under the influence of}} German Romanticism. In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of Nikolay Karamzin <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> with him. In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in St. Petersburg, then married to the Georgian Prince Alexander. Prior to graduation, Abovian learned his mother Takuhi had died.|$|E

5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} neglect the zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he added some {{specimens}} and also gave some specimens away.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their Flying Dutchman recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, Winter in America utilized a sparse production quality and {{small number of}} sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts. Adams and Bowens, <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> with Scott-Heron at Lincoln University, arrived from the Pennsylvania-based college {{on the last day}} of recording on October 15, 1973. Scott-Heron and Jackson handled most of the vocals, songwriting, and instrumentation, and they were assisted by Williams with the production.|$|E
