5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle to live in a non-nomadic <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote. The other Juste character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Monty Brown and Jeff Hardy to {{determine}} the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy scored a two-count on Brown by slamming the back of Brown's head and neck into the mat with a reverse neckbreaker. Hardy then {{climbed to the top}} rope and jumped off with a somersault toward Brown, who was laying on his back in the ring, to attempt his signature Swanton Bomb maneuver. Once Hardy jumped, Brown moved out of the <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> performed his signature Pounce maneuver by crashing into Hardy. Brown followed by pinning Hardy at 8 minutes and 43 seconds to win the contest and become number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|In 1839 Major-General Charles Pasley, at {{the time}} a colonel of the Royal Engineers, {{commenced}} operations. Pasley had previously destroyed some old wrecks in the Thames to clear a channel using gunpowder charges; his plan was to break up the wreck of Royal George in a similar <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> salvage as much as possible using divers. The charges used were made from oak barrels filled with gunpowder and covered with lead. They were initially detonated using chemical fuses, but this was later changed to an electrical system using a resistance-heated platinum wire to detonate the gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this <b>way)</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> see if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

It is also possible to realize any polyhedral graph directly by choosing the outer face to be any face with at most five vertices (something that exists in all polyhedral graphs) and choosing more carefully the fixed shape of this face {{in such a way}} that the Tutte embedding can be lifted, or by using an incremental method instead of Tutte's method to find a liftable planar drawing that does not have equal weights for all the interior edges.|$|E

25|$|The only {{waterway}} {{still running}} above ground is the man-made New River, constructed in 1619 to bring water into London from Hertfordshire. However, two natural rivers still flow through Harringay beneath the ground. These {{are just two}} of the many springs and streams that used to flow through this part of London from the high ground to the west, down into the River Lea. Stonebridge Brook ran above ground meandering eastwards just {{to the north of}} the old Harringay House. It crossed the estate, running roughly beneath present-day Effingham and Fairfax Roads, ran along Green Lanes for a short <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> eastwards north of St Ann's Road and on to the River Lea. Although still flowing underground today, the Harringay section was fully culverted by 1885. Hermitage Brook flowed roughly along the southern boundary of the western part of Harringay and then, staying close to its southern edge, under where the Arena Shopping Park stands today. It was eventually culverted and now flows underground just to the south of the shopping park.|$|E
25|$|The 36,850-man Coalition army of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick {{successfully}} {{concluded the}} Siege of Mainz on 23 July 1793. The French garrison of 18,675 men surrendered {{and was released}} {{on the promise of}} not fighting the Coalition for one year. The French government immediately sent the released troops to fight in the internal War in the Vendée. During the siege, the French suffered approximately 4,000 casualties while the Coalition lost about 3,000. The 60,000-strong Army of the Rhine under Alexandre de Beauharnais and the 40,000-strong Army of the Moselle under Jean Nicolas Houchard were poised to march to the relief of Mainz. However, Beauharnais had not informed the Mainz garrison that help was on the <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> took too long to start his movement. After the fall of Mainz, both French armies retreated, the Army of the Rhine to Wissembourg and the Army of the Moselle to the Saar River. Blamed for the loss of Mainz, Beauharnais fell into a funk, begged to be relieved of command and on 23 August 1793 he was replaced by Charles-Hyacinthe Le Clerc de Landremont. Meanwhile, Houchard had been replaced by Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg on 5 August. Beauharnais was executed by guillotine on 23 July 1794. His widow Joséphine de Beauharnais later married Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|E

25|$|If a graph {{is drawn}} {{in the plane}} with {{straight}} line edges, then an equilibrium stress is defined as an assignment of nonzero real numbers (weights) to the edges, with the property that each vertex is in the position given by the weighted sum of its neighbors. According to the Maxwell–Cremona correspondence, an equilibrium stress can be lifted to a piecewise linear continuous three-dimensional surface such that the edges forming the boundaries between the flat parts of the surface project to the given drawing. The weight and length of each edge determines the difference in slopes of the surface {{on either side of}} the edge, and the condition that each vertex is in equilibrium with its neighbors is equivalent to the condition that these slope differences cause the surface to meet up with itself correctly in the neighborhood of the vertex. Positive weights translate to convex dihedral angles between two faces of the piecewise linear surface, and negative weights translate to concave dihedral angles. Conversely, every continuous piecewise-linear surface comes from an equilibrium stress in this way. If a finite planar graph is drawn and given an equilibrium stress in such a way that all interior edges of the drawing have positive weights, and all exterior edges have negative weights, then by translating this stress into a three-dimensional surface in this <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> replacing the flat surface representing the exterior of the graph by its complement in the same plane, one obtains a convex poyhedron, with the additional property that its perpendicular projection onto the plane has no crossings.|$|E

Her {{conversion}} continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953, Yorktown was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain William M. Nation in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast {{through most of the}} summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco {{on her way to the}} Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in Yokosuka, Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the Sea of Japan. The Korean War armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, Yorktown put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the Academy Award nominated short subject documentary film Jet Carrier. She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8–28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.|$|E

The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between [...] "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals". Near {{the end of his}} life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled enough to try other dynamics.|$|E

Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology {{to allow you to}} prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western up in a very classic <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens.

500|$|Animals used as {{livestock}} {{are predominantly}} herbivorous, the main exception being the pig {{which is an}} omnivore. The herbivores {{can be divided into}} [...] "concentrate selectors" [...] which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious young foliage, [...] "grazers" [...] which mainly feed on grass, and [...] "intermediate feeders" [...] which choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelopes are ruminants; they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it again and thus extract the maximum possible food value. The dietary needs of these animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow {{from the base of the}} leaf-blade, enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut. In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass). Other forage crops are also grown and many of these, as well as crop residues, can be ensiled to fill the gap in the nutritional needs of livestock in the lean season.|$|E

Lucky is an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct underworld activities for him. His daughter, Simran, is engaged to marry Sunny (Abhishek Bachchan), the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer, Batuk Maharaj (Saurabh Shukla), whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra [...] "K" [...] to his real name (Khurana) {{as well as to the}} conclusion that the 'Second Innings House' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live. Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a manglik (an individual whose Vedic astrological makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage, mostly leading to the death of the spouse after a certain calculated period of marriage). But Lucky trick Kkhurana by saying that the doctor had put the wrong time of birth.

The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment.
