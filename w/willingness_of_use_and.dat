40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{renewable energy}} sources (RES) potentials in Iran, their share in current energy mix remains minor comparatively to fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Government strategies and targets for deployment of RES in Iran exist. Also several scientific works were written on technical and economic feasibility of such solution. However, the question about public acceptance in Iran of energy transition based on deployment of RES remains open. It this research we assume that socio-psychological factors might lay {{a significant role in}} public acceptance to use RES. We base our research on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which we expand to investigate the quetion <b>of</b> <b>willingness</b> to <b>use</b> <b>and</b> public acceptance <b>of</b> RES. As one of the methods of analysis, we conducted a survey (N= 260) among Iranian students in the universites of the city of Esfahan, in the center of Iran. We assume that these stakeholders will {{play a key role in}} deployment of RES in the future, they will be active as energy project managers, as they are currently studying engineering disciplines, and might contribute to the energy transition in Iran. We analyzed empirical data from the survey with the help of structural equation modeling. Our results show that moral norms, attitudes and perceived behavioral control are significat factors influencing willingness to <b>use</b> <b>and</b> public acceptance <b>of</b> RES, while subjective norms and self-identity do not play a significant role...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{family and}} {{community}} factors encouraging Tasmanian rural {{high school students to}} continue with post- compulsory (or post-Year 10) education and training at urban senior secondary colleges. The research is based on a purposive and positive sample of 24 students who had successfully completed Year 11 studies and intended completing Year 12 then proceeding to post-Year 12 education and training. They had previously attended rural high schools that had a) a good record of retention to Year 11 in urban senior secondary colleges, b) student achievement levels comparable to urban schools and c) good community links. Students' experiences of the initial three years of post-compulsory education and training were explored in interviews conducted in 2003 during Year 12, and approximately one year later. A further perspective on students' experiences was drawn from 55 interviews conducted later in 2003 with people students nominated as important in encouraging them. Thematic analysis revealed three student participation profiles — a straightforward and successful experience, a problematic but successful experience and a limited experience. The concept of social capital provided a means of accounting for and integrating the range of {{family and community}} factors that influenced development and realisation of the students' post-compulsory education and training aspirations. It was useful in understanding students' post-compulsory education and training careers, particularly in terms of their awareness <b>of,</b> <b>willingness</b> to <b>use,</b> <b>and</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> available family <b>and</b> community resources and in explaining the benefits of students' personal networks. The concept was most useful in understanding development of post-compulsory education and training aspirations of students expected to participate at that level, of students exposed to family regret over non-participation, and the realisation or nonrealisation of students' aspirations. The concept was less helpful in understanding the post-compulsory education and training careers of a minority of the students who were highly intrinsically-motivated and self-reliant, had been less influenced by family and community when developing and realising their aspirations, and had grown up in families where post-compulsory education and training was not valued above other activities in which students may engage after completing school. The significance of the research lies in its investigation of continuing rural underrepresentation in post-compulsory education and training from the student perspective. The thesis explores the application of different Concepts of social capital found in the literature. Using a social constructivist approach, and ethnographic and phenomenological methods, several indicators of social capital in rural students' family and community networks are examined to assess their usefulness in understanding rural students' post-compulsory education and training careers...|$|R

The purposes of this article were to understand the <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> hospitalsin Taiwan to <b>use</b> report cards <b>and</b> to explore the factors that influencethe <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> hospitals to <b>use</b> them. Methods: A postal survey study was conducted on 495 hospitals to explore factorsinfluencing the <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> hospitals to <b>use</b> report cards. A multiple logisticregression was performed to identify statistically significant factors relatedto the <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> the hospitals to use report cards. Results: In total, 52. 0 % of the sampled hospitals were "very willing" or "willing" touse report cards. The top three factors which respondents felt most influencedthe <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> hospitals to <b>use</b> report cards were the provision forincorrect data, the upgrading of the image of the hospital, and the increase inadministrative costs. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that thewillingness <b>of</b> hospitals to <b>use</b> report cards was positively significantly associatedwith the score of the factor "to upgrade the image of the hospital" (OR= 8. 0; 95 % CI 1. 8 - 36. 0), and it was negatively associated with the score ofthe factor "to increase the possibility of malpractice suits" (OR = 0. 5; 95 %CI 0. 2 - 0. 9). Conclusions: It was also found {{that more than half of}} hospitals were willing to use reportcards.

40|$|The rise {{of smart}} {{technologies}} has created new opportunities to support {{blind and visually}} impaired persons (VIPs). One of the biggest problems we identified in our previous research on problems VIPs face during activities of daily life concerned the recognition of persons and their facial expressions. In this study we developed a system to detect faces, recognize their emotions, and provide vibrotactile feedback about the emotions expressed. The prototype system was tested to determine whether vibrotactile feedback through a haptic belt is capable of enhancing social interactions for VIPs. The system consisted of commercially available technologies. A Logitech C 920 webcam mounted on a cap, a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 carried in a mesh backpack, an Elitac tactile belt worn around the waist, and the VicarVision FaceReader software application, which recognizes facial expressions. In preliminary tests with the systems both visually impaired and sighted persons were presented with sets of stimuli consisting of actors displaying six emotions (e. g. joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust) derived from the validated Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set and Warsaw Set of Emotional Facial Expression Pictures with matching audio by using nonlinguistic affect bursts. Subjects had to determine the emotions expressed in the videos without and, after a training period, with haptic feedback. An exit survey was conducted aimed to gain insights into the opinion of the users, on the perceived usefulness and benefits of the emotional feedback, <b>and</b> their <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the prototype as assistive technology in daily life. Haptic feedback about facial expressions may improve the ability of VIPs to determine emotions expressed by others and, as a result, increase the confidence of VIPs during social interactions.

We examined predictors of nurses’ (N = 67) willingness to use telehealth in the context of three models: the Unified Theory <b>of</b> Acceptance <b>and</b> <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> Technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et al., 2012), the technology acceptance model of the Center for Research and Education on Aging and Technology Enhancement (Czaja et al. 2006), and a combined model. The strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>willingness</b> to <b>use</b> was the belief that telehealth would improve job performance (β =. 46, p 2 ̆ 6 lt;. 001); beliefs about how much effort telehealth requires was also a strong predictor (β =. 27, p 2 ̆ 6 lt;. 05). Willingness to use was also related to social influences and privacy concerns. Results inform potential interventions to boost telehealth use...|$|R

Establishing the significance of Aristotle in this area has often led modern commentators to equate Aristotle’s descriptive analysis <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> exchange to the definitions of use-value and exchange-value as it is found in Karl Marx. In this article, I show that Aristotle’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> exchange is qualitatively different from this interpretation, focusing in particular on the ethical nature <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> how, for Aristotle, exchange is an extension of practical deliberation...|$|R
