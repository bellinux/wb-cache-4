5|$|The ship's keel {{was laid}} down in 1843 at the New York Navy Yard; she was {{launched}} on 27 June 1846, and commissioned on 6 November, with Captain Samuel Livingston Breese in command. Her construction was accelerated so she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> for the impending war with Mexico. Although she could carry 22 guns, Albany sailed with only 20.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the {{municipal}} government made a plan public complete up to 890 km of expressways (277 km in 2006). By 2006, the 6th Ring Road <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed.</b> Also in that year, a major batch of expressways <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completed.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry {{said he was}} not sure when the novel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete,</b> but {{confirmed}} that it would discuss the meaning of God. By March 1978, the novel was said to be half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel. When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete.</b> He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Senior Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin appointee, {{signed a}} {{decision}} {{for the removal of}} the institute. The decision, dated 7March 1995, ordered the institute's departure by 1996. Simultaneously, the institute wrote to Luzhkov describing the earlier events from their perspective, and requested compensation for loss of the building. In a meeting with the Polish Ambassador, Stanisław Ciosek, on 15March 1995, the acting mayor of Moscow, Alexander Musykantski, assured him that the return of the church <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete.</b> Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E
5|$|Citi Bike {{finally began}} {{operations}} on May 27, 2013, with 332 stations. The stations {{were located in}} Manhattan south of 59th Street and in Brooklyn north of Atlantic Avenue and west of Nostrand Avenue. Officials said the system opened with 6,000 bikes. At the time of implementation, {{it was the largest}} bikesharing program in the United States. When launched, the system was slated to expand to 10,000 bicycles and 600 stations in Manhattan south of 79th Street, plus stations in several Brooklyn neighborhoods, including Greenpoint, Crown Heights, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens as well as parts of Queens. At first, the timeline for the expansion was not made publicly available, but it was later announced that the expansion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by the end of 2016. There has been increasing interest in further expansion across New York City; for example, in June 2013 a Brooklyn politician opened a petition drive to accelerate deployment in Greenpoint. In contrast, the May 2013 installation deliberately bypassed South Williamsburg.|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim conquests of the Eastern Roman Empire and Arab wars {{occurred}} between 634 and 750. Starting in 633, Muslims conquered Iraq. The Muslim conquest of Syria would begin in 634 and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by 638. The Muslim conquest of Egypt started in 639. Before the Muslim invasion of Egypt began, the Eastern Roman Empire {{had already lost}} the Levant and its Arab ally, the Ghassanid Kingdom, to the Muslims. The Muslims would bring Alexandria under control and the fall of Egypt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by 642. Between 647 and 709, Muslims swept across North Africa and established their authority over that region.|$|E

There was also need of a lighthouse keeper's dwelling, a small storage room and docks. The construction <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by mid-1857 and the light guided ships through the pass later that year.|$|E

25|$|The Northern {{line was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to switch to}} automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and {{for a number of}} years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit from the experience of installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It is now being undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014 with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO.|$|E
25|$|All {{the work}} {{related to the}} Parallel Postulate {{revealed}} that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing so. Careful examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, {{there was a clear}} need for a new set of axioms, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete,</b> and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as Hilbert's axioms, were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his dissertation Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of Geometry). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.|$|E
