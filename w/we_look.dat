5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, <b>we</b> <b>look</b> these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and {{see nothing but}} destruction, avarice, and boredom. So <b>we</b> <b>look</b> to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E
25|$|The past went that-a-way. When {{faced with}} a totally new {{situation}} we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to {{the flavor of the}} most recent past. <b>We</b> <b>look</b> at the present through a rear-view mirror. We march backward into the future. Suburbia lives imaginatively in Bonanza-land.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the water}} glimmering in the crater beneath us {{on the edge of}} which <b>we</b> sat. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at heaven above in which the great moon sailed royally. Then <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> into each other's eyes.|$|R
5000|$|John E. McLaughlin, who at {{the time}} was the Deputy Director of the CIA, {{described}} the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: [...] "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at photographs. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at timetables. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at who was where and when. It is wrong to say that <b>we</b> didn't <b>look</b> at it. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity." ...|$|R

25|$|Bohm's {{proposed}} implicate order applies both {{to matter}} and consciousness. He {{suggested that it}} could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order. Bohm claimed that when <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at matter, we see nothing that helps us to understand consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, apparent power can {{be calculated}} from this. For active power it would at first appear {{that we would have}} to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, if <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.|$|E
25|$|MWI response: the {{splitting}} can {{be regarded}} as causal, local and relativistic, spreading at, or below, the speed of light (e.g., we are not split by Schrödinger's cat until <b>we</b> <b>look</b> in the box). For spacelike separated splitting you can't say which occurred first — but this is true of all spacelike separated events, simultaneity is not defined for them. Splitting is no exception; many-worlds is a local theory.|$|E
60|$|Neither he nor I {{seemed to}} fancy {{dealing with this}} part of the inquiry. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at each other, and then <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> at the tide, oozing in smoothly, higher and higher, over the Shivering Sand.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>looked,</b> and as <b>we</b> <b>looked,</b> {{behold the}} writing on it turned first to the colour of blood and then faded away, till {{presently}} {{there was nothing in}} my hand but a blank sheet of papyrus.|$|R

25|$|We’d like {{to thank}} {{everyone}} we’ve worked with at Parlophone over the last 28 years both in the UK and abroad. When we signed to the label in 1985 {{we had no idea}} how long and successful a relationship we were embarking on. However it is also exciting now to commence a new phase working with a new team in a new business structure and <b>we</b> <b>look</b> forward to a creative and equally fulfilling relationship with Kobalt.|$|E
25|$|When {{a law of}} Torah {{conflicts}} with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} finding a way to address the problem. As a halakhic movement <b>we</b> <b>look</b> to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old. At the same time, we are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E
25|$|We {{learn as}} girls that in ways both subtle and obvious, {{personal}} and political, our value as females is largely determined by how <b>we</b> <b>look.</b> … For black women, {{the domination of}} physical aspects of beauty in women's definition and value render us invisible, partially erased, or obsessed, sometimes for a lifetime, since most of us lack the major talismans of Western beauty. Black women find themselves involved in a lifelong effort to self-define {{in a culture that}} provides them no positive reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. We {{have lived}} here four years, but <b>we</b> were <b>looking</b> for him before that. It was not {{in this part of}} Scotland <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> for him. <b>We</b> gave up <b>looking</b> for him before we came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{his wife}} answered, 'Master, <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> upon that gazelle as <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> upon you. It was the gazelle {{who came to}} ask me of my father, it was the gazelle who brought me from my father, and I was given in charge to the gazelle by my father.' ...|$|R

25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if <b>we</b> <b>look</b> back {{on the fact that}} we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. I can still appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
25|$|Whereas Darwin spent {{just five}} {{weeks in the}} Galápagos, and David Lack spent three months, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have made {{research}} trips to the Galápagos for about thirty years, particularly studying Darwin's finches. Here <b>we</b> <b>look</b> briefly at {{the case of the}} large cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris, on Isla Genovesa (formerly Tower Island) which is formed from a shield volcano, and is home to a variety of birds. These birds, like all well-studied groups, show various kinds of morphism.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E
6000|$|Nobody spoke. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> at one another, {{and each}} one seemed to see his own mean and guilty {{thoughts}} reflected {{in the faces of}} the others. In silence, we dragged out and overhauled the Gladstone. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> up the river and down the river; not a soul was in sight! ...|$|R

25|$|These {{devices have}} been studied, and {{reviewed}} by Raman. Here <b>we</b> <b>look</b> primarily at the Hartmann whistle. The shock {{cells of the}} jet interact with the shock {{in front of the}} cavity (the flow in the cavity being subsonic). Small symmetric disturbances in the jet stream are amplified as they proceed toward the cavity (similar in some respects to the hole tone) causing the shock in front of the cavity to oscillate. The shock front acts much like a piston source of high energy resulting in a monopole-like sound field. Again the volumetric flow is directional unlike the theoretical monopole.|$|E
25|$|Frescoes {{painted on}} the barrel vault in the nave were almost destroyed, which {{contained}} standing figures of Prophets from Old Testament. That conclusion became according to the small remains of the frescoes on that place of nave, which for iconographic was quite expected. On the southern half, {{the eastern part of}} that, on frescoes was illustrated few standing figures so when <b>we</b> <b>look</b> how much frescoes are destroyed {{in that part of the}} church, we get a conclusion that at least there have been 10 or more figures on one side of arch, so above 20 in total.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017 as <b>we</b> <b>look</b> at the {{convenience}} store channel, Reese’s is the largest confection brand by far: It's 62% larger than the next brand, with more households purchasing Reese’s than any other confection brand across the U.S. Reese’s includes the No. 1-selling confection item – the iconic Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups King Size, and six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items. The Reese’s brand also accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within {{the convenience}} store channel, with the top two items in all four seasons (Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, and Holiday). As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales.|$|E

6000|$|They may be {{answered}} as the weavers {{of a certain}} country (thank God, not England) answered them in the potato famine with their mad song, 'We looked to the earth, and the earth deceived us. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> to the kings, and the kings deceived us. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> to God, and God deceived us. Let us lie down and die.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{chest was}} a very {{important}} piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that <b>we</b> <b>look</b> for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E
25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, <b>we</b> <b>look</b> for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that <b>we</b> <b>look</b> a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that <b>we</b> <b>look</b> good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
