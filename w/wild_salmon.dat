25|$|Declines in the {{abundance}} of <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> due to over fishing placed greater pressure on hatcheries to increase production and restore the <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> stock to supply fisheries. The problem is that hatcheries can never truly replicate the environment of <b>wild</b> <b>salmon,</b> an issue which often results in physiological and behavioral differences between <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> and those reared in hatcheries. These differences are often the product of genetic changes associated with inbreeding, artificial selection, and natural selection as well as different environmental pressures acting on hatchery fish than wild populations. Due to the size selective nature of fishing favoring larger fish, a reduction in average size of the adult salmon has been observed over time. The smaller salmon make {{a greater proportion of}} the remaining individuals continuing the population, and problems arise when these hatchery-reared fish are introduced into the wild populations. Unlike <b>wild</b> <b>salmon,</b> larger salmon are selected for in hatcheries and are typically much larger than <b>wild</b> <b>salmon.</b> The result is that hatchery-produced salmon tend to out-compete <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> for space, food, and other resources. Some salmon species in hatcheries exhibit predatory behavior toward <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> because they grow to be much larger. Regardless of whether predation is observed, natural social interactions are disturbed by the release of large numbers of hatchery-reared salmon where wild populations are low because salmon in hatcheries naturally have a higher propensity towards aggressive behavior. Overall, natural salmon populations are put at risk when hatchery-reared salmon populations are introduced due to competition for resources, predation by larger individuals, and negative social interactions that upset the natural order observed in <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> populations. As a result, <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> populations are steadily dropping as the pressure to continue breeding salmon in hatcheries increases. Conservation efforts that work to place limitations on hatcheries to increase the <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> populations are hindered by financial pressures because hatcheries effectively support many states economically by accounting for over 70% of the salmon harvested for recreational and commercial purposes.|$|E

Anadr. Fish Comm. Bull. 5 : 255 – 264. Abstract: Wild and hatchery-reared coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) have now co-existed in the Strait of Georgia for over 30 years, and have exhibited considerable variation in marine survival rates. This study {{is the first to}} compare diets of juvenile hatchery and <b>wild</b> coho <b>salmon</b> during the critical early marine period of this species. From 1997 – 2007, over 10, 000 stomachs from juvenile coho salmon captured in the Strait of Georgia were examined. Diets in July were dominated by decapods (primarily crab megalops) and fish (primarily herring). In September, euphausiids and amphipods (primarily hyperiids) dominated. The variability between hatchery and <b>wild</b> coho <b>salmon</b> diet was larger in September than in July. Prey volume, stomach fullness and fork length were significantly correlated between hatchery and <b>wild</b> coho <b>salmon</b> in the July and September surveys. While coho salmon captured in September surveys had significantly higher percentages of empty stomachs than those from July, {{there were no significant differences}} in the percentage of empty stomachs between hatchery and <b>wild</b> coho <b>salmon</b> in either survey. Shifts in diet composition occurred both annually and seasonally, but the trends for both groups of coho salmon were the same. Thus, we conclude there were no significant differences observed between hatchery and <b>wild</b> coho <b>salmon</b> in either appetite (volume of prey in the stomach) or in diet (composition of stomach contents) in either July or September surveys from 1997 – 2007 in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada...|$|R

25|$|Sea lice, {{particularly}} Lepeophtheirus salmonis {{and various}} Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and <b>wild</b> <b>salmon.</b> Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto {{the skin of}} <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young <b>wild</b> <b>salmon</b> are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable.
