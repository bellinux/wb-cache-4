40|$|Abstract — Until {{recently}} music {{could only}} be created using physical instruments. Now, in the digital era, synthesis techniques {{can be used to}} recreate and modify the sounds of these instruments. Synthesis techniques can be classified into categories such as processed recording, spectral model, physical model and abstract algorithms.

From the spectral model we will review the simplest techniques of additive synthesis and subtractive synthesis as well as <b>wave</b> <b>table</b> synthesis. From the physical model we will review a voice modeling approach by ways of modeling a human throat and also a model of a plucked string.

40|$|The design {{objective}} was to develop an inexpensive digital to analog (D/A) converter for use in vision science. Soundcards are hardware units that can be integral or {{can be added to}} a computer to add sound capability. A soundcard contains D/A converters designed to work in the audio frequency range, typically 20 – 20, 000 Hz. Soundcard outputs are high-pass filtered and thus do not convey sub-audio frequency or dc information. It is possible to circumvent this design feature by programming the desired output waveform as an amplitude modulation of a high frequency carrier, and then demodulating the soundcard output. The circuit, using a 20 kHz carrier, provides precise D/A conversion for the frequency range relevant for vision experiments, dc to 100 Hz, using inexpensive readily available components. The specific application was for 8 channels of D/A conversion using a Macintosh computer running under OS X. The software needed to program stimuli was created using CoreAudio, a library for programming sounds in OS X. Using soundcards on other platforms would not be a problem, as long as there exists a low level library that would enable the <b>wave</b> <b>table</b> to be filled...|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> in unconfined aquifers {{has important implications}} {{across a range of}} disciplines including the mobility of sediments on beaches and for the mixing of oceanic and sub-surface water masses at the coastal margin. This paper presents a new laboratory dataset on the {{propagation of}} simple harmonic water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> in an unconfined sandy aquifer. The new data covers a wider range of non-dimensional aquifer depths (3 < ݊߱݀/ ܭ < 244) than has been previously studied. Consistent with previous findings, the data exhibits exponential amplitude decay and linear increase in phase lag as the water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> propagates into the aquifer. These dispersive properties of water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> can be described by a complex water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> number (݇ ݅݇) where the real part (݇) describes the decay in amplitude and the imaginary part (݇) describing the rate of increase in phase lag with landward distance. The experimental wave numbers are compared with those predicted by existing theories based on small-amplitude water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> dispersion and numerical modelling using the Richards Equation for unsaturated groundwater flow. This comparison reveals that for large non-dimensional aquifer depths (i. e. high oscillation frequencies) there are significant qualitative discrepancies in the data-prediction comparison. Firstly, the magnitude of the observed decay rates (݇) are significantly greater than the predicted values indicating that there is additional energy dissipation in the data than has not been accounted for in both the existing analytical theories and the numerical model. Secondly, in the high frequency limit many of the existing theories predict zero phase lag (i. e. a standing wave scenario) however the data indicates that the phase lag is monotonically increasing with increasing oscillation frequency (increasing	݊߱݀/ܭ). Further research will be directed at reconciling these discrepancies...|$|R

30|$|The {{sound of}} vocal singing is a {{compound}} sound, which {{is composed of}} the pitch of the singing and other partial sounds. Vocal training is an extremely {{important part of the}} vocal teaching process. Both teachers and students need to use the auditory system to judge and identify the sounds produced during singing. These include distinguishing the pitch, strength, and rhythm, as well as a series of phonetic factors that distinguish the physiological state of the singing and the vocabulary pronunciation and language sensation. It can be said that the process of vocal music learning is actually a process of establishing the correct sound concept, and the establishment of this concept depends to a large extent on the sensitivity of the vocal learner’s auditory system. The quality of hearing has a very direct relationship with the physiological conditions and experience of the listener. The most obvious thing about the sound spectrum description and identification of the pronunciation of multimedia computer technology is that it has accuracy and intuitiveness. During the vocal training process, we recorded the singer’s singing voice through a computer and observed various subtle parameters of the emitted sound through the function chart and the sound <b>wave</b> <b>table</b> displayed on the computer screen. This is a positive complement to the human auditory system in an objective perspective. The use of the computer to participate in the vocal music teaching process has a positive effect {{on the quality of the}} vocalist’s pronunciation, as well as the analysis of singing and speech intelligibility. The following is a spectrum image analysis test for vocal sounds and the like [14].|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} a coastal {{aquifers}} forced by oscillations in an adjacent sea and/or estuary across a sloping boundary has recently received considerable theoretical attention. Despite such a wealth of mathematical advancements, stringent testing {{of the limitations of}} these models has yet to be undertaken. In all of the currently available analytical solutions it has been assumed that a single length scale is sufficient to account for both the amplitude decay rate and the rate of increase in phase lag (the wave speed) as the water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> propagates landward. All of the available field and laboratory data however indicate {{that this is not the}} case.

40|$|Comprehensive {{measurements}} are presented of the piezometric head in an unconfined aquifer during steady, simple harmonic oscillations {{driven by a}} hydrostatic clear water reservoir through a vertical interface. The results are analyzed and used to test existing hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic, small-amplitude theories along with capillary fringe effects. As expected, the amplitude of the water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> decays exponentially. However, the decay rates and phase lags indicate the influence of both vertical flow and capillary effects. The capillary effects are reconciled with observations of water table oscillations in a sand column with the same sand. The effects of vertical flows and the corresponding nonhydrostatic pressure are reasonably well described by small-amplitude theory for water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> in finite depth aquifers. That includes the oscillation amplitudes being greater at the bottom than {{at the top and}} the phase lead of the bottom compared with the top. The main problems with respect to interpreting the measurements through existing theory relate to the complicated boundary condition at the interface between the driving head reservoir and the aquifer. That is, the small-amplitude, finite depth expansion solution, which matches a hydrostatic boundary condition between the bottom and the mean driving head level, is unrealistic with respect to the pressure variation above this level. Hence it cannot describe the finer details of the multiple mode behavior close to the driving head boundary. The mean water table height initially increases with distance from the forcing boundary but then decreases again, and its asymptotic value is considerably smaller than that previously predicted for finite depth aquifers without capillary effects. Just as the mean water table over-height is smaller than predicted by capillarity-free shallow aquifer models, so is the amplitude of the second harmonic. In fact, there is no indication of extra second harmonics (in addition to that contained in the driving head) being generated at the interface or in the interior. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} an alternative Boussinesq equation considering hysteresis effect via a third-order derivative term. By introducing an improved moisture-pressure retention function, this equation describes, with reasonable precision, groundwater propagation in coastal aquifers subject to Dirichlet boundary condition of different oscillation frequencies. Test results confirmed {{that it is}} necessary to consider horizontal and vertical flows in unsaturated zone, because of their variable influences on hysteresis. Hysteresis in unsaturated zone can affect the water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> number of groundwater wave motion, such as wave damping rate and phase lag. Oscillations with different periods exert different hysteresis effect on wave propagation. Truncation/shrinkage of unsaturated zones also affects the strength of hysteresis. These impacts can be reflected in the alternative Boussinesq equation by adjusting the parameter representing the variation rate of moisture associated with pressure change, as opposed to traditional computationally expensive hysteresis algorithms. The present Boussinesq equation is simple to use and can provide feasible basis for future coupling of groundwater and surface water models...|$|R

Using this nature of sound waves, Ruben’s tube has been created. In Ruben’s Tube, by the help of pressure, standing waves are created. In this extended essay, I investigated the effect of frequency change of a sound wave on standing waves. Also by doing such an experiment I have also proved that sound is a pressure wave too since vibrations are given into a tube while gas is given from the other side. To acquire accurate results, variables in the experiment have been made constant (controlled) such as the type of gas given which is natural gas into the tube and the same tube is used for all trials. Loudspeakers have not been changed or not moved {{in order not to}} differ the distance between the membrane and the speaker. The analyzed results after several data collection and calculations verify that the wavelength and the frequency generated are directly proportional. As the frequency given increased in hertz, the number of antinodes and nodes increased too. Therefore when the number of nodes and antinodes increases, wavelength decreases which shows the inverse relation between wavelength and frequency.

40|$|A new {{laboratory}} {{data set}} {{on the behavior of}} a shallow water table in a sand column aquifer subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing at its base is presented and discussed. The data are analyzed using the dynamic effective porosity, which is defined as the ratio of the rate of change in total moisture to the rate of change in water table elevation; thus, a reduction in this parameter means that the extent of moisture exchange has been reduced relative to a given water table fluctuation. The data show a clear decrease in the dynamic effective porosity with increasing proximity of the water table to the sand surface, which is consistent with previous research under a steadily rising or falling shallow water table. The observed reduction in moisture exchange due to shallowness of the water table has implications for periodic flow scenarios such as the propagation of water <b>table</b> <b>waves</b> in coastal and beach groundwater systems. That is, as moisture exchange is reduced, less work is being done by the flow, and thus, energy dissipation rates for shallow water tables will be reduced relative to the case of a deeper water table. At present no account of the influence of water table shallowness has been included in theories describing water <b>table</b> <b>wave</b> dispersion. The present experiments, in conjunction with the dynamic effective porosity concept, provide a framework in which this gap in knowledge can be further investigated. Additional experiments were designed such that the free surface transgressed the sand surface for part of the oscillation period to investigate the influence of meniscus formation and deformation at the sand surface on periodic flow dynamics. The observed behavior is consistent with previous observations of steady infiltration above shallow water tables, namely, a rapid drop (rise) in pore pressure with the onset of meniscus formation (deformation). A simple "wetting and drying 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 model is derived, accounting for the variation in effective porosity caused by the free surface transgressing the sand surface, which is shown to accurately capture the observed behavior.
