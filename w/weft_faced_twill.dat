30|$|Moreover, {{the figures}} show that in the warp wise {{direction}} reduction in stiffness is higher as compared to weft direction. This {{could be attributed to}} the construction of fabrics which were 2 ends up warp <b>face</b> <b>twill</b> weave. As a result warp yarns face higher amount of friction than weft yarns. The figures also shows that trend of reduction in stiffness in both warp and weft way direction treated with both the enzymes are similar for indigo and sulphur dyed denims. This may be because the effect of enzymes on stiffness is independent of the dye applied to the fabric.|$|R

50|$|Both {{warp and weft}} can {{be visible}} in the final product. By spacing the warp more closely, it can {{completely}} cover the weft that binds it, giving a warp faced textile such as repp weave.Conversely, if the warp is spread out, the weft can slide down and completely cover the warp, giving a <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> textile, such as a tapestry or a Kilim rug.

40|$|So far the {{theoretical}} approach to weaving resistance and fabric geometry and the factors affecting {{it have been}} made for such weaves as plain, hop-sack and warp and <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> ribs. In this work theoretical models were adopted to determine the fabric geometry and weaving resistance. Experimental and theoretical findings are in agreement. The trends of the effects on values of weaving resistance of such factors as warp elastic constant, weft tension, warp tension, the coefficient of friction of yarn against. yarn agree with the trends obtained by other workers by showing that weaving resistance increases with these factors. The results-also show that-the fabric geometry depends on warp and weft tension at-the moment of beat-up. Additionally, the change of fabric geometry across the fabric, the effect of two different let-off mechanisms,, Hattersley and WIRA/Poole, and the beaming CO processes on weaving resistance and fabric geometry were investigated. It {{was found that the}} fabric width-depends on the dynamics of fabric formation before and at the moment of beat-up. Wool Industries Research Associatio...|$|R
40|$|Three tunics {{from the}} Azapa Valley, in {{northern}} Chile, {{dating to the}} Late Formative Period (330 A. D.) are presented showing the first complex ways of weaving from this area. They are woven as warp faced and the pattern design is made changing colors through discontinuous warps and mixing with <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> weaving {{at the bottom of}} the tunics. One of them has coarse embroidered selvedges, which probably were created as reinforcement for the sides and as decorative features for the textile. The tunics originally formed part of mummy bundles that were excavated in small mounds or funerary túmulos between several layers of organic matter and earth. Most of the other textiles that also formed part of the bundles are made combining several techniques like slit-tapestry and different kinds of embroidery. Other objects, such as a wooden whistle and feathers are located in the same area, so this area is considered to be a burial ground for distinctive persons. Looking at the colors (blue and green) and at the unusual techniques used in the valleys, is it possible to think that the weaving tradition comes from the higher lands of the Andes. Similar tunics have also been found in Tarapacá, located south of the Azapa valley...|$|R
5000|$|Like other {{indigenous}} garments, the quechquemitl is {{made from}} uncut pieces of cloths as they come off the loom. Quechquemitl designs are achieved through weaving (fiber, color, structure), surface ornamentation (usually embroidery) and finishes applied to the seams and edges. [...] Various kinds of weaves are done for quechquemitls includes gauze, seersucker, brocade and curved or shaped weaving. The finest gauze pieces are from the Sierra Norte de Puebla, with very complex arrangements of heddles, often with six used {{and as many as}} twenty have been noted. These gauze weavings tend to be more complex than those used for huipils. Some appear as a checkerboard pattern. Seersucker is used by adding commercial threads in stripes along with the handspun threads. The commercial threads do not shrink when washed and the puckering effect is created. Weft brocade is a decorative technique where heavier threads are introduced in the weft to create patterns. A looped brocade is also created by tugging on these weft threads to raise them. These brocades are often mistaken as embroidery in both Mexican and Guatemalan textiles. The curved weaving technique is particularly complicated and unique. Part of the warp is of white cotton and part a colored wool, either red or pink. The wool warp is much longer than the cotton at a point in the weaving producing warp faced fabric. The wool warp is cult and used as weft in a <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> band, given the look of a colored border. The curvature is designed to fall on the shoulders of the wearer. This type of garment {{can be found in the}} Sierra Norte de Puebla region.|$|R
30|$|The {{backrest}} or whip roller {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts of a weaving machine, and lengthwise yarn of the fabric known as warp yarn passes over the backrest. One of the main functions of the backrest oscillation is to compensate variation in warp tension as they are unwound from the weaver’s beam during each weaving cycle of the loom. This tension can not be kept constant during the process and also during each weaving cycle of the loom. But due to have a very negligible difference among the tensions of each loom cycle, an average value of tension is maintained throughout the weaving process in factory. If this tension is kept at a constant then the fabrics will be woven with minimum number of warp breakages yielding a better loom efficiency and higher quality. The correct selection of the backrest of a loom is vital in producing high quality woven fabric. Adjustments to the positioning of the backrest, its type are inevitable when the performance of the weaving machine can no longer be tolerated with standard settings for low weft density, high weft density, and extra heavy fabrics. Vary in fabric density is a crucial especially in technical textiles and smart textiles (Fernando 2014). Denim fabrics have developed into a part of the garment fashion since the ninetieth century. Most consumers around the world prefer cotton apparel; in particular, they enjoy wearing denim. The success of denim is due to its ability to change with every social and cultural evolution (Card et al. 2006). According to Textile terms and definition published by Textile Institute Denim is traditionally a 3 / 1 warp <b>faced</b> <b>twill</b> fabric made from yarn dyed warp and undyed weft yarn. As denim is one type of woven fabric so it is obvious that like other woven fabrics, properties of denim is also affected by position of whip roller.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Textile {{production}} in Guatemala {{has been the}} focus of a considerable amount of twentieth century literature in the English language. Guatemalan textiles have been avidly collected by museums, universities and private collectors in North America and Europe. Our belief as researchers and collectors is that we are recording and preserving the valuable textile traditions of the indigenous people of Guatemala. What we often don 2 ̆ 7 t realize is that collectively, over time, we are saying as much about our own perspective as outsiders as we are about the Guatemalan people and their textiles. Our choices of what to document and what to collect reflect our own biases. As important as what we choose to study and collect is what we do not select. One type of textile which is ubiquitous to the region but consistently overlooked is the woollen blanket of Momostenango. Because their format and function are familiar to outsiders and because they are routinely sold to tourists, the blankets and related woollen textiles have not been considered worthy of research or collection. By examining this example of omission, this paper considers our collecting and research practices, particularly as they relate to tourist textiles. The long term impact of our attitudes may be to limit the capacity of the literature and collections to record the full range of textile traditions in Guatemala. THE MOMOSTENANGO BLANKET For the purposes of this paper, I am using the Momostenango blanket as an archetypical example of what has generally not been collected among Guatemalan textiles. This paper is not about Momostenango woollen textiles per se but more about our collective attitudes to trade goods, particularly widely distributed items and more particularly, items included in the tourist trade. For anyone not familiar with the ubiquitous Momostenango blanket, I will provide a brief visual and verbal description. Most blankets commonly seen by visitors are made of a <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> brushed wool either on a wool or cotton warp. Patterns are created by the use of discontinuous wefts using a dovetail join, or by double <b>faced</b> supplementary <b>wefts.</b> Blanket patterns can also be formed using warp striping, weft striping or twill checks and plaids, although these latter techniques are more common in blankets not aimed at the tourist market. Patterns include versions of many of the images found in other Guatemalan textiles such as munjecas or human forms, animals such as horse or deer, assorted birds including the tourist industry favoured quetzal, various plant forms and geometries. Colours include natural whites, blacks and grays as well as a variety of commercial dye colours such as blue, red, yellow, brown, purple or green. Natural dyes were used before commercial dyes were available...|$|R
40|$|My {{recent study}} of Inca Period {{clothing}} has involved textile collections from three south coastal areas of Peru (Figure 1) : Pachacamac, a large Inca center and temple complex just south of Lima (Uhle 1903 / 1991 : Ch XXI: 89 - 96); Rodadero, a storage facility overlooking the Inca center of Tambo Viejo in the Acari Valley (Katterman and Riddell (1992 : 141 - 167); and Burial House # 2, the western hillside cemetery affiliated with the Inca outpost of Quebrada de La Vaca in the Chala Drainage (Katterman 2003 b). From the burial house (Figure 6), Dorothy Menzel and Francis Riddell collected and documented 120 burials plus an additional 140 items of clothing without burial associations (1954; Von Hagen 1956 : 204). Gold flakes (Figure 7) over the eye orbits of many individuals in the burial chamber, including women and children, attested to their relatively high status. In spite of this, only a few burials at Quebrada de la Vaca West contained clothing of the quality identified as the fine and colorful <b>weft</b> <b>faced</b> garments of the Inca elite (A. Rowe 1997 : 6 - 11; 1978 : 6 - 7). Most garments from the burial chamber were very plainly woven in warp-faced tan cotton yarn. The typical outfit for a male consisted of a large cloak, a tunic (unku), loincloth (wara), small coca bags, and perhaps, a sling or two (Figure 8 a- 8 e). Decoration on male garments was generally confined to seams and embroidered edges. Plain cross looping (Figure 29 a) bound both ends of loincloths. Blanket stitching (Figure 29 d) or overcast (Figure 29 f) served as the base for carrying pairs of colorful yams that crossed between stitches to form attractive patterns {{around the edges of}} cloaks. Exceptions to the plain male garments from the burial chamber appeared in the form of colorful tunics. One of these was a finely woven dark brown tunic (M- 54), Accompanying it in the burial were a plain tan cotton manta woven in two webs (120 x 70 + 70 cm) and bordered with decorative red and yellow yarn carried on blanket stitched base (Figure 29 d); a loincloth (56 x 44 cm) woven in one web like the one in Figure 8 c; and two slings. Bands of red, yellow and brown yarn in close figure- 8 stitching (Figure 29 e) joined the two panels of the dark brown tunic together in the center and under the arms openings. Damage to the tunic did not allow measurements to be taken beyond ascertaining that it had been about 60 cm wide and more than 70 cm long. A rendering of this once handsome tunic appears as Figure 12. A large fragment of another colorful tunic from Quebrada de La Vaca West (X- 5) displayed a pattern of two sets of yellow stripes between less frequent pairs of blue-green stripes on a bright red ground (Figure 5). While only the bottom, lower sides and part of the reinforcement under an armhole remained, this was sufficient to ascertain the construction of the tunic. It was of finely woven camelid yarn, weft-faced, and composed of two long panels seamed together up the center and under the arms. The seams and edge bindings were overcast in colorful bands of red, yellow and blue-green yarn. A decorative band about 0. 7 cm wide clung to parts of the bottom edge. The tunic measured 83 cm across the bottom and 77 cm up to the broken area slightly above the reinforcement under the arm opening Remnants of another camelid tunic with similar striping on a red ground was collected from the nearby site of Pueblo Viejo, and the style must have been somewhat common to the region...|$|R
40|$|The area of {{this work}} is distressed denim in women’s wear. Denim wear has been distressed by {{machines}} to imitate the individual patina that becomes from wearing e. g. a pair of unwashed jeans until the color strips from creases. This work uses challenges the faked used look, using a decorative motive in distressed denim. Lace {{has been used as}} a decoration of dress since medieval times. By using lace as the pattern for the distressing of denim one will decorate the denim in a destructive way that questions the perfection and delicate way that lace is usually used. Lace consists of threads and holes that builds an ornamental pattern, worn down denim often results in holes and threads at the most vulnerable areas of the garment. Denim is a warp <b>faced</b> cotton <b>twill</b> weave with blue indigo yarn in warp and natural white yarn in weft. By using a laser cutter to engrave a pattern on the warp faced side of the denim, one can set the settings on the laser cutter so that only the blue warp threads will be met by the laser beam. After wash the engraved warp threads will dissolve and depending on the scale and the design of the pattern the unengraved parts can dissolve as well. Therefor one needs to fix the unengraved parts of the pattern before wash if one wants the pattern to remain. There is several ways to fix the pattern before wash; this work includes fixing with laser cut fusing and with seams. Some of the garments aren’t engraved in this work but cut in the laser cutter. The two cutting techniques used is first a regular cut out technique and second a slicing technique. The shapes of the garments derives from typical denim and lace garments such as jeans, denim jackets, denim shirts, lace gown, wedding dresses and underwear such as negligees, corsets, bras and panties. Initially, experiments were done to understand the visual and technical effect of clashing materials and garments. The result is a collection, combining ideas from two different origins in fashion, denim from mineworkers and lace from nobles. The outfits manages how one can control distressed denim and shows a variation from lace, to garments where the traces of lace have completely or partially dissolved. The primary motive is to investigate surface possibilities in distressed denim through a specific pattern. The result is difficult to control and experiments in full scale are necessary to evaluate distressed experiments. The secondary motive is global. Can lasercutting and engravings be an alternative to sandblasting ? It is not dealt with in this investigation. However this investigation shows a selection of alternative expressions for distressed denim. This work challenges the idea of distressed denim as the only way to make a fake, torned effect. It points at new possibilities, using decorative motifs by lasercuts and engravings in combination with other treatments in search for alternative expressions in denimwear...|$|R
