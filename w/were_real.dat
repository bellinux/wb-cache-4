5|$|Several of the {{locations}} either <b>were</b> <b>real,</b> or were filmed {{with the use}} of stand-ins. The gate for the Area 51 set was filmed at a fence on the San Bernardino county line, one hundred and twenty miles away from Los Angeles. The restaurant that the characters visit, the Little A'Le'Inn, is an actual cafe off Highway 375 in Rachel, Nevada. The inside, however, was an elaborate set, as the original is much too small.|$|E
5|$|The authors detail {{commonly}} used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies, including forgery as covert operation {{in order to}} fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents <b>were</b> <b>real.</b> Additionally, the writers explain how Soviet covert spies were able to bring agents of influence into their fold and do their bidding, whether knowingly or through social influence as a useful idiot.|$|E

While {{the roots of}} 0 are not {{distinct}} (all equaling 0), the n nth roots of any other real or complex number are all distinct. If n is even and x <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and positive, one of its nth roots is positive, one is negative, and the rest are either non-existent (in the case when n = 2) or complex but not real; if n is even and x <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and negative, none of the nth roots <b>is</b> <b>real.</b> If n <b>is</b> odd and x <b>is</b> <b>real,</b> one nth root <b>is</b> <b>real</b> and has the same sign as x , while the other roots <b>are</b> not <b>real.</b> Finally, if x <b>is</b> not <b>real,</b> then none of its nth roots <b>is</b> <b>real.</b>|$|R
5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led members of Congress to believe that the alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States <b>were</b> <b>real.</b>|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings <b>were</b> <b>real)</b> and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they <b>were</b> <b>real</b> people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The former {{captain of}} the Black Pearl is resurrected during this film; however, he does not appear until the final shot before the credits. Having met his demise in the {{previous}} installment, Barbossa is resurrected by Tia Dalma and agrees to rescue Jack Sparrow {{in order to save}} the Black Pearl. For this role, Rush was uncredited to keep his return a surprise. The DVD commentary said that not even the cast of the movie knew that Rush would return his character, and that the expressions on the characters' faces when seeing {{him for the first time}} in three years <b>were</b> <b>real.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the at-large races, the two {{incumbent}} Democratic candidates, Victor E. Moore and Paul D'Ortona, led the ticket. Three other Democrats {{were also}} elected: John F. Byrne, Sr., {{who had previously}} been councilman for the 10th district; Henry W. Sawyer, a civil rights lawyer; and Marshall L. Shepard, a clergyman who had served as Commissioner of Records. On the Republican side, incumbent at-large councilman Louis Schwartz was re-elected. The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M. Foglietta, a young lawyer and son of former councilman Michael Foglietta. Also losing bids for the Republican at-large seats <b>were</b> <b>real</b> estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props <b>were</b> <b>real</b> and manufactured.|$|E

5|$|Many of the textures were {{accumulated}} {{during a}} three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer-generated environments {{of the time}} ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they <b>were</b> <b>real,</b> where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they <b>were</b> <b>real.</b> Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, {{even if they did}} not change existing plans, <b>were</b> <b>real</b> and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E

5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events <b>were</b> <b>real.</b> Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E
5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the train driver jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there <b>were</b> <b>real</b> or decoys.|$|E
5|$|Russia built {{a number}} of ironclads, {{generally}} copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there <b>were</b> <b>real</b> innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser, General-Admiral of the 1870s, {{and a set of}} remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as 'popovkas' (for Admiral Popov, who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy. Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fulton {{asked how}} many {{solutions}} to a problem of enumerative geometry can <b>be</b> <b>real,</b> when that problem is one of counting geometric figures of some kind having specified position with respect to some general fixed figures.

5|$|Stories or {{descriptions}} of animal hybrids {{have appeared in}} many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria (the wolpertinger) and elsewhere. Natural history texts such as Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri (The History Book of Natural Quadrangles) by Joannes Jonstonus (John Jonston) in the 17th century and illustrations such as Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they <b>were</b> <b>real</b> creatures, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato {{was arrested and charged}} with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film <b>were</b> <b>real,</b> which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication of the Photo article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E
5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them <b>were</b> <b>real</b> revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
