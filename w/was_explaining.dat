5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
25|$|In September 1854 Darwin had {{the last}} of his {{barnacle}} monographs ready for publication, and he turned his attention fully to questions about how species originated. He freely discussed his intention to write a book on the subject, and planned avenues of research with other scientists. He went over his previous notes and writings on the topic, and drew up proposals for investigations and research into the implications of his theory. One topic <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> geographical distribution of organisms; he got information from international correspondence, and experimented on the viability of methods of dispersal. He widened his investigations into variability in nature, and experimented on plant hybridisation and cross-fertilisation.|$|E

Haig <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> what he and Nixon’s staff thought were Nixon’s only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon’s staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.|$|E

The following day she <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> through a spokesman, that the accommodation Mollaths in psychiatry was a consequence of his crimes and {{had nothing to do with}} his wife or his lawsuit against the bank. She said, Mollath harmed his wife with strangulation marks on the neck, large hematoma and a bleeding bite wound. He also stabbed dozens of car tires, including those on vehicles of the wife's lawyers. His accommodation was confirmed by the Federal court and is observed regularly.

25|$|The fourth-day of {{the battle}} was noted for the valour shown by Bhima. Bhishma {{commanded}} the Kaurava army to move on the offensive from the outset. While Abhimanyu {{was still in his}} mother's womb, Arjuna had taught Abhimanyu on how to break and enter the chakra vyuha. But, before explaining how to exit the chakra Vyuha, Arjuna was interrupted by Krishna (other story: Abhimanyu's mother falls asleep while Arjuna <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> her). Thus from birth, Abhimanyu only knew how to enter the Chakra vyuha but didn't know how to come out of it. When the Kauravas formed the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu entered it but was surrounded and attacked by a number of Kaurava princes. Arjuna joined the fray in aid of Abhimanyu. Bhima appeared on the scene with his mace aloft and started attacking the Kauravas. Duryodhana sent a huge force of elephants at Bhima. When Bhima saw the mass of elephants approaching, he got down from his chariot and attacked them single-handedly with his iron mace. They scattered and stampeded into the Kaurava forces killing many. Duryodhana ordered an all-out attack on Bhima. Bhima withstood all that was thrown at him and attacked Duryodhana's brothers, killing eight of them. Bhima was soon struck by an arrow on the chest and sat down in his chariot dazed.|$|E

500|$|Television pundits have criticised {{the writing}} of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts [...] "often corny, even painfully so", using Monty Everard's line [...] "You'll come to regret {{crossing}} swords with me, sir!" [...] from [...] "Health Hazard" [...] (2003) as an example. Hanks also wrote about what he called [...] "moral oversimplification" [...] of the storylines; the same episode featured [...] "a wealthy and self-important businessman—who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving—ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> that he had to take his wife to a function at—the icing on this shabby cake—Downing Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously". The series is frequently lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenarios. Andy Hamilton called the dialogue [...] "the funniest on TV" [...] and David Mitchell selected it as his [...] "TV hell" [...] in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Deed's [...] "swashbuckling" [...] persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers. Despite the criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestuous relationships.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

5000|$|Reschers {{proposal}} in [...] "The Price of an Ultimate Theory" [...] is to dualize {{the concept of}} explanation so that a fact can <b>be</b> <b>explained</b> either derivationally, by the premises which lead to it, or systemically, by the consequences which follow from it. With derivational explanation, a fact t <b>is</b> <b>explained</b> when it <b>is</b> subsumed by some prior, more fundamental fact t.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term {{is in the works}} of Aristotle. The most {{well-known}} such case is De Anima Book III, chapter 2, especially at line 425a27. The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the five specialized sense perceptions, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of [...] "perceptible" [...] or [...] "sensible" [...] which is specific (Greek: idia) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the [...] "common sensibles" [...] (or [...] "common perceptibles"). In this discussion [...] "common" [...] (koinos) is a term opposed to specific or particular (idia). The Greek for these common sensibles is ta koina, which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing. Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{from his}} {{assumption}} of the cardinal's hat in 1530, Cardinal de Tournon {{had been in a}} position to see and to disapprove of some of the doings at the royal court and elsewhere among the aristocracy. [...] Calvinism and Lutheranism had been making inroads among the aristocracy, and in particular with King Francis' only sister Marguerite de Navarre. Around 1535 she had become sufficiently emboldened that she requested the King for permission to invite Philipp Melanchthon, Luther's closest associate, to Court. [...] She wished to have him discuss his theology and debate with orthodox Christians. [...] Tournon felt compelled to intervene, however dangerous the prospect might be, and he delicately persuaded the King that showing any favor or even lenience toward Protestants would be a bad idea. [...] The most famous of these confrontations, however, came {{at the end of the}} Cardinal's life. From 9 September 1561 to 9 October 1561 Cardinal François de Tournon was one of six cardinals, including the Papal Legate Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who attended the Colloquy of Poissy, which had been summoned by Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici and her Chancellor Michel de l'Hôpital in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation between Catholics and Calvinists (Huguenots) in France. [...] At the First Session, however, when Theodore Beza, John Calvin's French disciple, <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> the Calvinist view of the Eucharist, Cardinal de Tournon could not contain himself and launched into a denunciation of Beza's heresies.|$|E
2500|$|Many creationists and {{scientists}} engage in frequent public debates regarding {{the origin of}} human life, hosted {{by a variety of}} institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate. For example, in May 2004 Michael Shermer debated creationist Kent Hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience. In Shermer's online reflection while he <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was [...] "not an intellectual exercise," [...] but rather it was [...] "an emotional drama," [...] with scientists arguing from [...] "an impregnable fortress of evidence that converges to an unmistakable conclusion," [...] while for creationists it is [...] "a spiritual war." [...] While receiving positive responses from creationist observers, Shermer concluded [...] "Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable (evolution v. creation is not), with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion." [...] (see Non-overlapping magisteria). Others, like evolutionary biologist Massimo Pigliucci, have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try [...] "to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks" [...] and at Hovind's assertion that biologists believe humans [...] "evolved from bananas." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{lawsuit was}} {{filed in the}} U.S. state of California on September 9, 2014, by the state chapter of the National Federation of the Blind, in {{response}} to the reported denial of services to [...] "more than 30" [...] blind customers—the lawsuit claimed that the conduct was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and California state law. The Washington Post published a direct quote from the complaint, in which the Federation claims that its constituency [...] "face the degrading experience of being denied a basic service that is available to all other paying customers." [...] Two cases were described in the Post article: First, a California UberX driver allegedly stored a service dog in the trunk of his vehicle and refused to acknowledge the blind passenger's concern upon the latter's realization of what had occurred; second, a driver allegedly cursed at a blind passenger during a verbal exchange, in which the latter <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> the nature of the guide dog. According to the complaint, the driver suddenly accelerated, and nearly injured the dog, while also striking the passenger's blind friend with an open car door. Uber responded to a number of blind passengers who reported their experiences, stating that since Uber drivers were independent contractors, the company was unable to oversee their conduct. The Federation replied in a public statement that Uber closely monitored its drivers' work practices through the Uber app, that Uber advised blind passengers to notify drivers about their guide animals in advance, and that the Federation was proceeding with the filing of the lawsuit after Uber refused to enter into a negotiation with them to resolve the issue.|$|E

2500|$|At 17:30 of {{the same}} day, Grandi went to Palazzo Venezia; the {{official}} reason was the presentation to Mussolini {{of a new book}} about the Italian participation in the non-intervention committee in Spain. The meeting was scheduled to last 15 minutes, but at the end it was prolonged until 18:45. Waiting to be received by the Duce were the Chief of Police and the German Feldmarschall Kesselring. In his memoirs written one year later, Mussolini denied that he spoke with Grandi about the OdG, but this is not credible. It is apparent that Grandi, who loved the Duce, explained to him the consequences of his OdG, giving him a last chance to save face and resign before the vote. In that case, the Grand Council’s meeting would have been superfluous. Mussolini listened while Grandi <b>was</b> <b>explaining</b> the necessity to resign to avoid a catastrophe, but at the end rebuked him saying that his conclusions were wrong, since Germany was about to produce a decisive secret weapon. After that, Mussolini met Kesselring and the Chief of Police, Chierici: to the latter he confided {{that it would have been}} easy to bring Grandi, Bottai and Ciano back to the fold, as they were eager to be persuaded by him. On the morning of 23 July Mussolini accepted the resignation of Cini: this was supposed to be a signal to his opponents. At the same time, at Federzoni's home, Grandi, Federzoni, de Marsico (one of the best jurists in Italy), Bottai and Ciano modified the OdG, removing the interpretative introduction which explained the functions of the Grand Council. Here they demonstrated that the assembly had the constitutional power to remove Mussolini. In fact, according to the constitutionalists, the [...] "Leggi Fascistissime" [...] of December 1925 bent the Constitution, but did not break it. Because of these laws, the Duce ruled the country on behalf of the King, who remained always the source of the executive power. Because of that, if the Grand Council, which was the trait d'union between Fascism and the state, passed a vote of no confidence on the dictator, the King would have been entitled to remove him and nominate his successor. In that occasion Ciano was acquainted with the OdG by Bottai: Grandi was reluctant to accept him, since he was the son-in-law of Mussolini and was known for his superficial and inconstant character, but Ciano insisted, unaware that this decision would have provoked his death six months later in Verona. After that, Grandi had as a guest at his office in the parliament Farinacci, showing him his OdG. Farinacci told Grandi that he accepted the first part of the document, but that he did not agree at all on the rest: the military powers had to be given to the Germans, and Italy should start to fight the war seriously, getting rid of Mussolini and the generals. At the end he, like Scorza, asked him for a copy of his OdG, and like Scorza he used it to produce another OdG of his own. In the time left before the meeting, Grandi contacted other participants asking them to join his action.|$|E
