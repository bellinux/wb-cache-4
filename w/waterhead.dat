5|$|Oldham, {{considered}} as {{a combination of the}} 2001 electoral wards of Alexandra, Coldhurst, Hollinwood, St. James, St. Marys, St. Pauls, <b>Waterhead</b> and Werneth, has an average age of 33.5, and compared against the average demography of the United Kingdom, has a high level of people of South Asian heritage, particularly those with roots in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Due to the town's prevalence as an industrial centre and thus a hub for employment, Oldham attracted migrant workers throughout its history, including those from wider-England, Scotland, Ireland and Poland.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{recorded}} named places of Oldham is Hathershaw, occurring in a deed for 1280 with the spelling Halselinechaw Clugh. Existing as a manor in the 15th century, Hathershaw Hall was {{the home of a}} Royalist family in the 17th century who lost part of their possessions due to the English Civil War. <b>Waterhead,</b> an upland area in the east of Oldham, traces its roots to a water cornmill over the border in Lees.|$|E
50|$|Eddleston Water rises near Mount Lothian {{and passes}} through <b>Waterheads,</b> Eddleston, Milkieston, Redscarhead {{along the route}} of the A703. It runs passing Dundee and Dalatho into Peebles where the Tree Bridge crosses it. When the Edinburgh to Peebles railway was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century the river was {{straightened}} for much of its course which adversely affected the wildlife habitat and increased the speed of flow. As a result, the river is liable to flooding.|$|R
50|$|The water {{repelled}} by the roof during a rainstorm is potentially {{damaging to the}} building that the roof protects. If it runs down the walls, it may seep into the mortar or through panels. If it lies around the foundations it may cause seepage to the interior, rising damp or dry rot. For this reason most buildings have a system in place to protect {{the walls of a}} building from most of the roof water. Overhanging eaves are commonly employed for this purpose. Most modern roofs and many old ones have systems of valleys, gutters, waterspouts, <b>waterheads</b> and drainpipes to remove the water from the vicinity of the building. In many parts of the world, roofwater is collected and stored for domestic use.|$|R
40|$|Data {{availability}} {{in developing}} countries for water management, planning and design constitutes a challenge for comprehensive spatial and temporal studies. Prediction in Ungauged Basin (PUB) is an on-going area of research of modern hydrology. The Nile is the world’s longest stream which, depending {{on the time of}} the year, water travels for about 20 days in the Blue Nile tributary and more than 45 days for in White Nile tributary. Intermediate and long term flow prediction for the Nile is crucial for the management and operation of the existing water control infrastructures from the Central and Eastern parts of Africa up to Egypt via the middle reaches (Sudan). An effective and appropriate way to study the vast Nile is to work at subbasin level and this study aims at providing a rational approach for flow prediction in the Semliki watershed- one of the <b>waterheads</b> of the White Nile. This thesis deals with the assessment of landscape interactions with water resources in the data scarce Semliki watershed of the Equatorial Nile. Using a combination of limited ground information, remotely sensed acquired datasets, GIS and statistical techniques, conceptual deterministic, mesoscale hydrologic models for the catchment were developed. One of the outputs from this work is {{the development of a new}} equation for the correction of the FEWS-NOAA satellite generated rainfall for the Semliki watershed. It takes into account the spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall for the catchment. This is valuable for planners and managers of the water resources of the watershed who hitherto had relied only on one rainfall gauging station at Beni. The identification and grouping of similar subcatchments of the Semliki watershed from landscape attributes using ordination techniques and clustering analysis was performed. The ordination technique, namely the Principal Component Analysis, was further used in identifying data structure and redundant variables (landscape attributes) and subsequently guided the development of optimal model dimensions. Using regression-based techniques, monthly linear and non-linear deterministic prediction models were developed to predict flows within Semliki subcatchments from the physiographic attributes. Step-wise temporal and spatial sensitive analysis of the monthly flow on the variation of physiographic attributes was carried out for both the linear and non linear predictive models. The stream length of catchment was found to be generally most sensitive. While providing water managers and planners with useful tools in a data-poor watershed, this study calls for urgent steps to be taken in acquiring Hydro meteorological data that can support further investigations into physically based modelling approaches that explicitly account for the interaction between landscape attributes and water resources in the Semliki watershed of the equatorial Nile region...|$|R

5|$|Milnrow War Memorial {{is located}} in Memorial Park at Newhey, and is a Grade II listed structure. The war {{memorial}} was originally sited in central Milnrow, set back from the road near Milnrow Bridge, and was unveiled on 3 August 1924 by Major General A. Solly-Flood, a former commander of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The memorial is constructed of sandstone surmounted by a bronze statue of a First World War infantryman with rifle and fixed bayonet symbolic of the young manhood of the district {{in the early days}} of the First World War. In selecting the design the Milnrow War Memorial Committee was influenced by the statue unveiled at <b>Waterhead</b> in Oldham; the work of George Thomas. Thomas sculpted Milnrow's memorial in 1923.

6000|$|But my aunt, being a {{woman of}} will, kept her way; and {{about the same time}} that {{occurred}} tending to confirm her in her new departure. This was the introduction into our small circle of James Wellington Gadley. Properly speaking, it should have been Wellington James, that being the order in which he had been christened in the year 1815. But in course of time, and particularly during his school career, it had been borne in upon him that Wellington is a burdensome name for a commonplace mortal to bear, and very wisely he had reversed the arrangement. He was a slightly pompous but simpleminded little old gentleman, very proud of his position as head clerk to Mr. Stillwood, the solicitor to whom my father was now assistant. Stillwood, <b>Waterhead</b> and Royal dated back to the Georges, and was a firm bound up with the history--occasionally shady--of aristocratic England. True, in these later years its glory was dwindling. Old Mr. Stillwood, its sole surviving representative, declined to be troubled with new partners, explaining frankly, in answer to all applications, that the business was a dying one, and that attempting to work it up again would be but putting new wine into worn-out skins. But though its clientele was a yearly diminishing quantity, much business yet remained to it, and that of a good class, its name being still a synonym for solid respectability; and my father had deemed himself fortunate indeed in securing such an appointment. James Gadley had entered the firm as office boy in the days of its pride, and had never awakened {{to the fact that it}} was not still the most important legal firm within the half mile radius from Lombard Street. Nothing delighted him more than to discuss over and over again the many strange affairs in which Stillwood, <b>Waterhead</b> and Royal had been concerned, all of which he had at his tongue's tip. Could he find a hearer, these he would reargue interminably, but with professional reticence, personages becoming Mr. Y. and Lady X.; and places, [...] "the capital of, let us say, a foreign country," [...] or [...] "a certain town not a thousand miles from where we are now sitting." [...] The majority of his friends, his methods being somewhat forensic, would seek to discourage him, but my aunt was a never wearied listener, especially if the case were one involving suspicion of mystery and crime. When, during their very first conversation, he exclaimed: [...] "Now why--why, after keeping away from his wife for nearly eighteen years, never even letting her know whether he was alive or dead, why this sudden resolve to return to her? That is what I want explained to me!" [...] he paused, as was his wont, for sympathetic comment, my aunt, instead of answering as others, with a yawn: [...] "Oh, I'm sure I don't know. Felt he wanted to see her, I suppose," [...] replied with prompt intelligence: ...|$|E
6000|$|From the South-west Coast of Cumberland,--1811. This poem opened, {{when first}} written, with a {{paragraph}} {{that has been}} transferred as {{an introduction to the}} first series of my 'Scotch Memorials.' The journey, of which the first part is here described, was from Grasmere to Bootle, on the south-west coast of Cumberland, the whole along mountain-roads, through a beautiful country, and we had fine weather. The verses end with our breakfast at the Head of Yewdale, in a yeoman's house, which, like all the other property in that sequestered vale, has passed, or is passing, into the hands of Mr. James Marshall, of Monk Coniston, in Mr. Knott's, the late owner's time, called <b>Waterhead.</b> Our hostess married a Mr. Oldfield, a lieutenant in the navy; they lived together for some time at Hackett, where she still resides as his widow. It was in front of that house, on the mountain-side, near which stood the peasant who, while we were passing at a distance, saluted us, waving a kerchief in his hand, as described in the poem. The dog which we met soon after our starting, had belonged to Mr. Rowlandson, who for forty years was curate at Grasmere, in place of the rector, who lived to extreme old age, in a state of insanity. Of this Mr. R. much might be said, both with reference to his character, {{and the way in which}} he was regarded by his parishioners. He was a man of a robust frame, had a firm voice and authoritative manner, of strong natural talents, of which he was himself conscious, for he has been heard to say (it grieves me to add with an oath), 'If I had been brought up at college by ---- I should have been a Bishop.' Two vices used to struggle in him for mastery, avarice and the love of strong drink. But avarice, as is common in like cases, always got the better of its opponent, for though he was often intoxicated it was never, I believe, at his own expense. As has been said of one in a more exalted station, he could take any given quantity. I have heard a story of him which is worth the telling. One Summer's morning our Grasmere curate, after a night's carouse in the Vale of Langdale, on his return home having reached a point near which the whole Vale of Grasmere might be seen with the Lake immediately below him, he stept aside and sat down upon the turf. After looking for some time at the landscape, then in the perfection of its morning beauty, he exclaimed, 'Good God! that I should have led so long such a life in such a place!' This no doubt was deeply felt by him at the time, but I am not authorised to say that any noticeable amendment followed. Penuriousness strengthened upon him as his body grew feebler with age. He had purchased property and kept some land in his own hands, but he could not find in his heart to lay out the necessary hire for labourers at the proper season, and consequently he has often been seen in half dotage working his hay in the month of November by moonlight--a melancholy sight, which I myself have witnessed. Notwithstanding all that has been said, this man, on account of his talents and superior education, was looked up to by his parishioners, who, without a single exception, lived at that time (and most of them upon their own small inheritances) in a state of republican equality, a condition favourable to the growth of kindly feelings among them, and, in a striking degree, exclusive to temptations to gross vice and scandalous behaviour. As a pastor, their curate did little or nothing for them; but what could more strikingly set forth the efficacy of the Church of England, through its Ordinances and Liturgy, than that, in spite of the unworthiness of the minister, his church was regularly attended; and though there was not much appearance in his flock of what might be called animated piety, intoxication was rare, and dissolute morals unknown? With the Bible they were, for the most part, well acquainted, and, as was strikingly shown when they were under affliction, must have been supported and comforted by habitual belief in those truths which it is the aim of the Church to inculcate.
