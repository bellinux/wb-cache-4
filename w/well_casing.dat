40|$|If {{geologic}} formations {{are used}} to sequester carbon dioxide (CO 2), monitoring the CO 2 injection {{will be required to}} confirm the performance of the reservoir system, assess leaks and flow paths, and understand the geophysical and geochemical interactions between the CO 2 and the geologic minerals and fluids. Electrical methods are well suited for monitoring processes involving fluids, as electrical properties are sensitive to the presence and nature of the formation fluids. High resolution tomographs of electrical properties are now possible using a 3 D technique called electrical resistance tomography (ERT). Surveys are commonly conducted utilizing vertical arrays of point electrodes in a cross-well configuration. Recent field results obtained using steel <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> as electrodes are promising. When 3 D ERT imaging can be performed using existing <b>well</b> <b>casings</b> as long electrodes, the need for additional drilling of observation wells is minimized. Using a model patterned after an oil field undergoing CO 2 flood, forward and inverse simulations of ERT surveys have been run to test the sensitivity of the method to changes resulting from CO 2 migration. Factors considered include resistivity contrast, anomaly proximity to electrodes, anomaly size and shape, measurement noise, and the electrode configuration used to perform the measurements. Field data suggest that CO 2 migration changes the resistivity of a layer, producing an anomalous region. In our numerical study, the anomalous region’s resistivity ranges from 0. 2 to 10 times that of the initial value. Its geometry ranges from a thin, horizontal finger to a planar, horizontal mass having vertical protrusions simulating leakage of CO 2 through caprock.
