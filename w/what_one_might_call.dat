Of the former, Ode for St. Cecilia's Day (1739) (set to texts by John Dryden) and Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to {{classical}} mythology for subjects, producing such works as Acis and Galatea (1719), Hercules (1745) and Semele (1744). These works {{have a close}} kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes performed onstage by small chamber ensembles. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, {{in addition to his}} renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.|$|E

Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that [...] "the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment—and it is yet one more instance of <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: [...] "The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest—indeed only—manifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare".|$|E

2500|$|Barrie {{also had}} friendships with other children, both before {{he met the}} Davies boys and after they had grown up, and there has since been {{speculation}} that Barrie was a paedophile. One source for the speculation is a scene in the novel The Little White Bird, in which the protagonist helps a small boy undress for bed, and at the boy's request they sleep in the same bed. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Barrie had sexual contact with children, nor that he was suspected of it at the time. Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately.

[...] He is sometimes guilty, in the first respect, of a certain over-writing – underlying exotic venue by exotic diction – though the two become more organically integrated as his work progresses; and in the second respect of <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> an over-scrupulousness on the part of his characters and his perceived attitude to them… These, however, are merely the consequence of aspiration and conscience; and as more of Bishop's work has appeared – and his reputation has grown – he has shown…a more coherent melding of exotic vision, ethics and style." ...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{shortage}} of features that can be put forward as the core of, or at least a major part of, an ideal society. Such elusive communities might be described as "just", "fair", "free", "egalitarian", "democratic", "humane", "efficient", "prosperous", "benevolent", or perhaps simply as "good". What people actually mean by such descriptions is by no means clear.

60|$|At last, when {{we could}} just discern the faces close to us, a {{simultaneous}} movement began. Lights began to flash out in places all over the hillside. At first these seemed as tiny as glow-worms seen in a summer wood, but by degrees they grew till the space was set with little circles of light. These in turn grew and grew in both number and strength. Flames began to leap out from piles of wood, torches were lighted and held high. Then the music began again, softly at first, but then louder as the musicians began to gather to the centre, where sat the King and Queen. The music was wild and semi-barbaric, but full of sweet melody. It somehow seemed to bring before us a distant past; one and all, according {{to the strength of}} our imagination and the volume of our knowledge, saw episodes and phases of bygone history come before us. There was a wonderful rhythmic, almost choric, force in the time kept, which made it almost impossible to sit still. It was an invitation to the dance such as I had never before heard in any nation or at any time. Then the lights began to gather round. Once more the mountaineers took something of the same formation as at the crowning. Where the royal party sat was a level mead, with crisp, short grass, and round it <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> well <b>call</b> the Ring of the Nation was formed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Ovid's tale of {{the daughters}} of Minyas in Ov. Met. 4. It adds to the extensive discussion of metapoetics in Ovid’s {{tale of the}} daughters of Minyas (Ov. Met. 4. 1 - 415). It suggests that Ovid uses {{the description of the}} Minyeides to signpost his willingness to engage with other genres. The focus, however, is not the adoption of tragic or elegiac themes in the sisters’ stories, nor their use of elegiac vocabulary. Instead, this paper focuses on stylistic features, supported by, but not inherently dependent on, the medium of elegiac verse or metre, and on how Ovid adapts them even within the hexameter text of the Metamorphoses. One such stylistic convention found in elegy is <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> loosely <b>call</b> stichic organisation of content, which the paper aims to show is present in Ov. Met. 4. 32 - 41. The paper provides a close reading of the frame narrative of the Minyeides and their reluctance to embrace the cult of Bacchus, highlighting how Ovid’s text alternates between sympathy for and condemnation of the Minyeides’ actions. This shows that a pattern of stylised alternation is realised in the Metamorphoses without the motivation or support of explicit metrical alternation between hexameter and pentameter. Similar to the function of such stichic content organisation in elegiac verse, I argue that this stylistic feature is employed in Met. 4. 32 - 41 in order to emphasie differences between the two opposing value systems at war in this episode, between old and new, and between the conservative worship of Minerva and the newly introduced cult of Bacchus...|$|R
2500|$|During his 1904 {{retreat from}} Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical {{experience}} which suffused him with [...] "love for the whole world" [...] and convinced him that [...] "men at heart are divine." [...] This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published {{a number of books}} with <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> New Age themes, with titles like The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two issues}} {{in the area of}} accounting that I think are relevant to the present financial crisis and its aftermath. The first is the current “convergence project” whose goal is a single, unified set of accounting principles for for-profit, exchange-listed private business entities. This development deserves attention because it is widely unfamiliar to nonspecialists, but also because its genesis and development coincide with the ascendancy of post-WWII neoliberalism. Too, its full implementation would occasion major changes in the processes of measuring economic value. Its importance for what follows rests on the claims made by convergence advocates that this project will serve the public interest in its streamlining of private, for-profit accounting, a claim that certainly carries with it assumptions about an ideal equilibrium between public and private. My second focus will be on a 2006 White Paper from the US Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which makes a strong argument for a distinction between public and private accounting practices. This document motivated my choice {{to go back to the}} 18 th century for inspiration, since the White Paper struck me on first reading as the kind of document that prompts comparison with <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> generally <b>call</b> the spirit of the Enlightenment, in its positive but also critical senses. In other words, it offers a strong statement of principle – one that is highly morally inflected, clearly about values and just as clearly oriented toward a perceived threat of the priorities and procedures of government being undermined or even displaced by those of the corporation. In its emphasis on a notion of citizenship that is not equivalent or subordinate to the market or market behavior, I think it is in some important ways directly linked to certain Enlightenment ideals, particularly of representative government. Being a statement of principle, I will be using it here in order to raise some questions about the ways that public and private meet, and also to question the ‘corporatization’ of the public sphere...|$|R
40|$|Literature cannot help {{dealing with}} subjects, {{depicting}} them and giving birth and form to them, because texts speak of possible worlds and of possible means of orientation in those worlds. In {{the course of}} the 20 th Century the ideological task of Realism (the apprehension of society as a form of stable being) proved impossible, and its corresponding 2 ̆ 2 aesthetic vested interests 2 ̆ 2 became more and more apparent. This is the crisis of the Subject culminating in the European 2 ̆ 2 avant-garde 2 ̆ 2 that my study has addressed. ^ As for the Italian authors and works I have selected, Luigi Pirandello played a decisive role in destroying the age-old notions of subjectivity. If he himself was not significantly influenced by the avant-garde, one could argue that he influenced it in many ways, some of which have yet to be explored. In the first chapter of my dissertation I have discussed (through a reading of Uno, nessuno, centomila) the situation of the subject in Pirandello. In particular, I have argued that Pirandello came to dismantle the idealistic conception of an absolute subject by means of a kind of reverse reading of Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s The Phenomenology of Mind. ^ In the second chapter I have studied the relations between the French Surrealism and Giorgio De Chirico and Alberto Savinio. The two brothers are the only Italian writers (and artists) who effectively took part in the Surrealist movement, and again Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s Phenomenology proved most helpful in my analysis of the 2 ̆ 2 idealistic temptation 2 ̆ 2 that the Surrealists experienced and tried to overcome. ^ In the third chapter I have attempted to show how Calvino 2 ̆ 7 s quest of a transcendental subject was born of his distrusting the traditional conception of the subject, as embodied in the idealistic dyad of Consciousness and Self-Consciousness, and finally led him to abandon the 2 ̆ 2 platonism 2 ̆ 2 of his structuralistic phase in favor of <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>might</b> broadly <b>call</b> 2 ̆ 2 phenomenological patterns 2 ̆ 2. ^ The appendix comprises two essays on non-contemporary texts: La novella de Grasso legnaiuolo and Boccaccio 2 ̆ 7 s Ameto. ...|$|R
