40|$|The {{article is}} deals for new {{experimental}} equipment for effective test adhesion for selected coating STEEL, applied cold on the coated metal sheet with Al (aluminum). Explanation {{to the word}} STEEL: STEEL coating has significant anti- corrosive properties and he is resistant for main oxidizing agents such as acids, alkalis, salt vapors etc. Resists tem- peratures to 600 ?C and create an elastic film that is resistant to abrasion, {{as soon as it}} was to complete po-lymerization. It is very simple to applied to metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Dries quickly and is dry to the touch after 90 to 120 seconds. STEEL is the best possible solution anywhere, if needs arises powerful local protection against atmospheric and corrosive agents or to elevated temperatures. STEEL is also useful as a method for protect of welds on stainless steels instead of traditional staining procedures. Broad application is in automotive industry to modify the surfaces of block vehicle, car-body repairs, <b>welds</b> needing <b>protection,</b> in heating industry for example boilers, in air condition with heat exchanger and in shipping industry.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was focused on {{comparing}} the welding modes during laser welding of butt joints of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V sheets 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm thick with direct diode laser and Disk solid state laser. Design/methodology/approach: Bead-on-plate welds were produced at different parameters of laser welding, different welding speed, different output laser power resulted in different heat input of laser welding process. The test welds were investigated by visual test, metallographic observations including macro and microstructure analysis. Additionally mechanical test were carried out such as tensile tests and technological bending test of the joints. The influence of basic laser welding parameters on the penetration depth, shape of fusion zone, width of welds and width of heat affected zones were studied. Additionally the phenomena of laser heating and melting of the welded sheets were analyzed. Findings: It was found that the mechanism of HPDL laser welding of titanium alloy differs distinctly from the mechanism of Disk laser welding. The test welds produced by HPDL laser were high quality. Welds produced by the Disk laser are characterized by a columnar shape of fusion zones, very narrow with narrow and fine structure heat affected zone. Research limitations/implications: In further investigations of laser welding of titanium alloys applying the key-hole welding mode a special care must be taken to the shielding of the <b>weld</b> zone and <b>protection</b> the <b>weld</b> pool and weld metal against the harmful gases from air atmosphere. Practical implications: Results of investigations presented in this paper may be applied directly for welding high quality butt joints of titanium alloy with the HPDL laser. In a case of laser welding with the Disk laser practical application requires further study, especially concentrated on the effectiveness of gas <b>protection</b> of the <b>welding</b> area including the key-hole, weld pool and surrounding regions of metal. Originality/value: This paper describes results of investigation concerning laser welding of the most common used titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V by two unique and modern lasers. The investigations were carried out using the high power diode laser with a rectangular laser beam spot and also using a new generation of Disk laser characterised very high power density of the laser beam spot...|$|R
40|$|In the beginning, EB-PVD (electron beam {{physical}} vapour deposition) {{of aluminium}} on strip steel was introduced as corrosion protection. Meanwhile, various metallic and oxide layer stacks on strip steel are {{applied in the}} car production industries {{in order to improve}} corrosion <b>protection,</b> <b>welding</b> ability, wear resistance and adhesion of organic top coatings. Double sided copper coating of strip steel by EB-PVD is industrially introduced with the aim to obtain solderable surfaces for pipe soldering of high pressure pipes of refrigerator systems and brake lines. Recently, aluminium coatings on steel based alloys are applied in the production of metal supported catalytic converters. High resistance coatings like SiO 2 on stainless steel are applied as protection layers between the back contact of thin film solar cells and the bearing flexible metallic substrate. Thus, EB-PVD is well established as a large area coating technology. Reactive EB-PVD allows the deposition of some important compounds. Although EB-PVD is a superior coating technology regarding highest deposition rates, its successful industrial application in some cases depends on a further improvement of layer properties. Plasma activated EB-PVD is a process combination which allows to increase density, hardness, refractive index and other properties of the coatings. One possibility of plasma activation concerning the electron beam evaporation process is the ignition of a spotless arc discharge on the EB heated evaporant which is well known as the SAD (spotless arc activated deposition) process. This process, in which an anode near the crucible is applied in order to ignite a spotless arc onto the electron beam heated evaporant in the crucible, has been extended {{for the first time to}} large area dimensions. Reactive large area SAD of titanium dioxide has been carried out at deposition rates of up to 70 nm/s. Results of these investigations will be presented. Advantages of the process include high plasma densities with an ionisation degree of up to 60 %, less expensive additional equipment in the process surrounding of the EB evaporator compared to other plasma generation tools, and coinciding position of the arc on the evaporant with the location of the electron beam generated vapour source. The dynamic deposition rate of titanium dioxide achieved approximately 1000 nm. m/min. Expensive titanium suboxides as evaporant can be replaced by low cost titanium. Latest experiments showed that the SAD process can be extended to large area technology with no limitations with respect to substrate width. Thus, the way into industrial application is open. Applications of titanium and titanium compounds in the finishing industries are tabulated, where SAD may be applied in the near future...|$|R

The final configuration and tank weight enabled international space station assembly in a high inclination orbit allowing international cooperation with the Russian Federal Space Agency. Numerous process controls were implemented to assure product quality, and innovative proof testing was accomplished prior to delivery. Process controls were implemented to assure cleanliness in the production environment, to control contaminants, and to preclude corrosion. Each tank was accepted via rigorous inspections, including non-destructive evaluation techniques, proof testing, and all systems testing. In the post STS- 107 era, the project focused on ascent debris risk reduction. This was accomplished via stringent process controls, post flight assessment using substantially improved imagery, and selective redesigns. These efforts were supported with a number of test programs to simulate combined environments. Processing improvements included development and use of low spray guns for foam application, additional human factors considerations for production, use of high fidelity mockups during hardware processing with video review, improved tank access, extensive use of non destructive evaluation, and producibility enhancements. Design improvements included redesigned bipod fittings, a bellows heater, a feedline camera active during ascent flight, removal of the protuberance airload ramps, redesigned ice frost ramps, and titanium brackets replaced aluminum brackets on the liquid oxygen feedline.

40|$|The {{largest single}} element of Space Shuttle is the External Tank (ET), {{which serves as}} the {{structural}} backbone of the vehicle during ascent and provides liquid propellants to the Orbiter s three Main Engines. The ET absorbs most of the seven million pounds of thrust exerted by the Solid Rocket Boosters and Main Engines. The design evolved through several block changes, reducing weight each time. Because the tank flies to orbital velocity with the Space Shuttle Orbiter, minimization of weight is mandatory, to maximize payload performance. The initial configuration, the standard weight tank, weighed 76, 000 pounds and was an aluminum 2219 structure. The light weight tank weighed 66, 000 pounds and flew 86 missions. The super light weight tank weighed 58, 500 pounds and was primarily an aluminum-lithium structure. The final configuration and low weight enabled system level performance sufficient for assembly of the International Space Station in a high inclination orbit, vital for international cooperation. Another significant challenge was the minimization of ice formation on the cryogenic tanks. This was essential due to the system configuration and the choice of ceramic thermal protection system materials on the Orbiter. Ice {{would have been a}} major debris hazard. Spray on foam insulation materials served multiple functions including thermal insulation, conditioning of cryogenic propellants, and thermal protection for the tank structure during ascent and entry.
