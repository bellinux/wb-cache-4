So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E
500|$|After {{two years}} of discussions, Vikram began a film under the {{direction}} of Selvaraghavan in a project dubbed by the media as Sindubad. The film began shoot and completed a schedule by early 2010 in the Himalayas with Swati Reddy appearing as the female lead. However, the film was reported to be momentarily shelved and subsequently never took off again after the producer Singanamala Ramesh walked out. Vikram then agreed terms to feature in Vikram Kumar's 24 produced by Mohan Natarajan, with Ileana D'Cruz signed on to play the female lead role. The film progressed briefly with shots being canned in caves, before the director was ousted from the project, cancelling the film. Vikram then also shot briefly for a third successive shelved project directed by Boopathy Pandian for the same producer, featuring him in the role of an investigative cop; however the film failed to progress and instead Natarajan financed Vikram's next. His 2011 release, Deiva Thirumagal directed by A. L. Vijay, saw Vikram portray a father with a developmental disability having the mental maturity of a seven-year-old. To prepare for the role, Vikram visited homes for the mentally challenged such as Vidya Sagar and Vidya Sudha for a month, watching their body language and taking notes. He also communicated with the patients, to pick up the nuances of people with impaired speech. Vikram has since gone on to describe his role as Krishna as the best character he has ever portrayed. The film which also featured Sara Arjun, Anushka Shetty and Amala Paul in supporting roles, opened to predominantly positive reviews from critics and enjoyed commercial success at the box office. The reviewer from The Deccan Chronicle described that the film was [...] "Vikram's show all the way" [...] and that [...] "his rendition of a mentally-challenged man trying to cope with the everyday realities of raising a child is a work of art", praising his [...] "fiery, complex performance as one of the more viciously honest depictions of mental illness cinema has seen". Similarly another critic described that the on-screen chemistry between Vikram and his daughter, played by Sara Arjun, is [...] "magic" [...] and their performances [...] "are sure to leave a lump in your throat". The critic from The Hindu praised the film and Vikram's performance but analysed that [...] "a problem arises only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> looking at Krishna as a character, and begin to see him as Vikram, the hero" [...] and that Vikram should have [...] "underplayed a little here and there and it would have worked better". However Vikram once again completed a sweep of the top acting awards that year, with further recognition at the Vijay and Filmfare Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{heading to}} The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California {{to record the}} album, the band spent time with Fortman in pre-production. Gray said [...] "I've found that those first few days are the most {{important}} when it comes to setting the album's tone and challenging the band about their goals and fine-tuning the arrangements for maximum emotional impact." [...] The band rented a ranch in Northern California where they wrote and rehearsed songs for the album. They converted its multi-stall garage into a makeshift studio. As with the band's previous album, Mudvayne chose to isolate themselves to provide inspiration for their songwriting. Matt McDonough stated [...] "Establishing clear goals for each song has been the key to Mudvayne's quick results. It's a strange contradiction, but it can be very liberating to set limitations on creativity as long as you don't let those limitations define you. It frees up a lot of creative energy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> pulling an idea in fifty different directions and start pushing it in one." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus {{every person}} among {{the lower classes}} in Naples, who has any disease, or infirmity, or {{malformation}} of any kind, considers it a treasure, and comes {{out into the street}} to exhibit it to all beholders, as a means of gaining money. No imagination can conceive more shocking and disgusting spectacles than those which the police of Naples allow to be brought up right before every lady or gentleman who attempts to take a walk in the streets. These sights meet you at every turn. Even if you take a carriage, you do not escape from them; for the beggars crowd around the carriage when you get into it, {{at the door of the}} hotel, and watch for it there when you come back. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> on the way to go into a shop, all that are in that street at the time gather up and wait at the door till you come out; and while you are getting into the carriage, and the coachman is shutting the door and mounting upon his box, they implore, and moan, and beg, and entreat you to give them a little money. They are so wretched, they say, they are dying of hunger.|$|E
60|$|And let {{not those}} whose eyes have been {{accustomed}} to the aristocratic gravity of Grosvenor Square and Hanover Square, the dowager barrenness and frigidity of Fitzroy Square, or the gravel walks and garden seats of the Squares of Russell and Euston, suppose that the affections of Tim Linkinwater, or the inferior lovers of this particular locality, had been awakened and kept alive by any refreshing associations with leaves, however dingy, or grass, however bare and thin. The city square has no enclosure, save the lamp-post in the middle: and no grass, but the weeds which spring up round its base. It is a quiet, little-frequented, retired spot, favourable to melancholy and contemplation, and appointments of long-waiting; {{and up and down}} its every side the Appointed saunters idly by the hour together wakening the echoes with the monotonous sound of his footsteps on the smooth worn stones, and counting, first the windows, and then the very bricks of the tall silent houses that hem him round about. In winter-time, the snow will linger there, long after it has melted from the busy streets and highways. The summer's sun holds it in some respect, and while he darts his cheerful rays sparingly into the square, keeps his fiery heat and glare for noisier and less-imposing precincts. It is so quiet, that you can almost hear the ticking of your own watch <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>stop</b> to cool in its refreshing atmosphere. There is a distant hum--of coaches, not of insects--but no other sound disturbs the stillness of the square. The ticket porter leans idly against the post at the corner: comfortably warm, but not hot, although the day is broiling. His white apron flaps languidly in the air, his head gradually droops upon his breast, he takes very long winks with both eyes at once; even he is unable to withstand the soporific influence of the place, and is gradually falling asleep. But now, he starts into full wakefulness, recoils a step or two, and gazes out before him with eager wildness in his eye. Is it a job, or a boy at marbles? Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ? No; sight more unwonted still--there is a butterfly in the square--a real, live butterfly! astray from flowers and sweets, and fluttering among the iron heads of the dusty area railings.|$|E
