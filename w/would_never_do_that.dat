The camp fire scene was {{originally}} a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes {{his love for}} Scott {{so that it was}} more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, [...] "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys.

Miles Davis <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> And I'm not into a greatest-hits thing.

Berman suggested that [...] "In the Pale Moonlight" [...] was the exception. Taylor said that the episode [...] "pushes the boundaries in a realistic way". In an interview in 2011, when talking about [...] "In the Pale Moonlight", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said [...] "we're not really {{willing to take the}} consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We dealt with issues like that and I don't think... you know... the other shows really went as far as we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{campaign}} officials referred {{reporters to}} Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb {{and members of}} his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would [...] "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, [...] "point the rifles at them , pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." [...] Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: [...] "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and {{do that kind of}} thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I would never want to do that." [...] Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.|$|E

He wanted her to go with him to the officer of the station, but she said that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for if it got to be known that she had peached about it, it would be as much as her life was worth.

But if this were her doing, then she must hate her, and most bitterly; and what had she done to earn such hate? And now Geoffrey was in danger on her account, danger of ruin, and how could she prevent it? This was her first idea.

6000|$|He {{was left}} to vain conjectures, however, as to Roderick's actual moods and occupations. He knew he was no letter-writer, and that, in the young sculptor's own phrase, he had at any time rather build a {{monument}} than write a note. But when a month had passed without news of him, he began to be half anxious and half angry, and wrote him three lines, {{in the care of}} a Continental banker, begging him at least to give some sign of whether he was alive or dead. A week afterwards came an answer--brief, and dated Baden-Baden. [...] "I know I have been a great brute," [...] Roderick wrote, [...] "not to have sent you a word before; but really I don't know what has got into me. I have lately learned terribly well how to be idle. I am afraid to think how long it is since I wrote to my mother or to Mary. Heaven help them--poor, patient, trustful creatures! I don't know how to tell you what I am doing. It seems all amusing enough while I do it, but it would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable eyes. I found Baxter in Switzerland, or rather he found me, and he grabbed me by the arm and brought me here. I was walking twenty miles a day in the Alps, drinking milk in lonely chalets, sleeping as you sleep, and thinking it was all very good fun; but Baxter told me it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> the Alps were 'd----d rot,' that Baden-Baden was the place, and that if I knew what was good for me I would come along with him. It is a wonderful place, certainly, though, thank the Lord, Baxter departed last week, blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante. But you know all about it and what one does--what one is liable to do. I have succumbed, in a measure, to the liabilities, and I wish I had some one here to give me a thundering good blowing up. Not you, dear friend; you would draw it too mild; you have too much of the milk of human kindness. I have fits of horrible homesickness for my studio, and I shall be devoutly grateful when the summer is over and I can go back and swing a chisel. I feel as if nothing but the chisel would satisfy me; as if I could rush in a rage at a block of unshaped marble. There are a lot of the Roman people here, English and American; I live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from morning till night. There is also some one else; and to her I don't talk sense, nor, thank heaven, mean what I say. I confess, I need a month's work to recover my self-respect." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Doesn’t {{she feel}} {{interested}} from what you’ve told her?” Lady Agatha’s admirer inquired. But Jackson didn’t heed his sister-in-law’s answer—he {{was thinking of}} something else. He said nothing more, however, about {{the subject of his}} thought, and before ten minutes were over took his departure, having meanwhile neglected also to revert to the question of Lady Agatha’s bringing her visit to his mother to a close. It wasn’t to speak to him of this—for, as we know, she wished to keep the girl and somehow couldn’t bring herself to be afraid of Herman Longstraw—that when her son took leave she went with him {{to the door of the}} house, detaining him a little while she stood on the steps, as people had always done in New York in her time, though it was another of the new fashions she didn’t like, the stiffness of not coming out of the parlour. She placed her hand on his arm to keep him on the “stoop” and looked up and down into the lucid afternoon and the beautiful city—its chocolate-coloured houses so extraordinarily smooth—in which it seemed to her that even the most fastidious people ought to be glad to live. It was useless to attempt to conceal it: his marriage had made a difference and a worry, had put a barrier that she was yet under the painful obligation of trying to seem not to notice. It had brought with it a problem much more difficult than his old problem of how to make his mother feel herself still, as she had been in his childhood, the dispenser of his rewards. The old problem had been easily solved, the new was a great tax. Mrs. Lemon was sure her daughter-in-law didn’t take her seriously, and that was a part of the barrier. Even if Barbarina liked her better than any one else this was mostly because she liked every one else so little. Mrs. Lemon had in her nature no grain of resentment, and it wasn’t to feed a sense of wrong that she permitted herself to criticise her son’s wife. She couldn’t help feeling that his marriage wasn’t altogether fortunate if his wife didn’t take his mother seriously. She knew she wasn’t otherwise remarkable than as being his mother; but that position, which was no merit of hers—the merit was all Jackson’s in being her son—affected her as one which, familiar as Lady Barb appeared to have been in England with positions of various kinds, would naturally strike the girl as very high and to be accepted as freely as a fine morning. If she didn’t think of his mother as an indivisible part of him perhaps she didn’t think of other things either; and Mrs. Lemon vaguely felt that, remarkable as Jackson was, he was made up of parts, and that it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> these should be rated lower one by one, since there was no knowing what that might end in. She feared that things were rather cold for him at home when he had to explain so much to his wife—explain to her, for instance, all the sources of happiness that were to be found in New York. This struck her as a new kind of problem altogether for a husband. She had never thought of matrimony without a community of feeling in regard to religion and country; one took those great conditions for granted just as one assumed that one’s food was to be cooked; and if Jackson should have to discuss them with his wife he might, in spite of his great abilities, be carried into regions where he would get entangled and embroiled—from which even possibly he wouldn’t come back at all. Mrs. Lemon had a horror of losing him in some way, and this fear was in her eyes as she stood by the doorway of her house and, after she had glanced up and down the street, eyed him a moment in silence. He simply kissed her again and said she would take cold.|$|E
