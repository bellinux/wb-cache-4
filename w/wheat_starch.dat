40|$|Starches from 3 common wheats and 10 durum wheats were {{isolated}} using a method causing little starch damage and annealing. Durum <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> contained 0. 21 - 0. 29 % ash, 0. 44 - 0. 57 % protein, 0. 39 - 0. 54 % lipid, and 26. 2 - 28. 5 % amylose. Wide angle X-ray diffraction measurements revealed A-type diffraction patterns. Durum <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> gelatinised over a broad temperature range (12. 5 degrees C) around 55. 5 degrees C (peak temperature), as measured with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (starch/water = 1 / 2; heating rate = 4 degrees C/min). Under the experimental conditions, swelling power was typically 11. 3 g/g and amylose leaching during gelatinisation was ca. 17. 2 %. The granule size distributions showed a large heterogeneity within the starches of the durum wheat family. Clear {{differences were found}} in the gelatinisation behaviour of durum and common <b>wheat</b> <b>starches.</b> Earlier swelling of the common <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> during gelatinisation and the larger enthalpy of amylose-lipid endothermic transition (ca. 1. 3 mJ/mg) in the DSC for durum <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> can be explained in terms of true lipid contents and levels of amylose-lipid inclusion complexes. Other findings, such as the earlier gelatinisation behaviour of durum <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> revealed by DSC, cannot be explained in that way.

40|$|Small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (SAXS) {{together with}} several complementary {{techniques such as}} differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction, have been employed to investigate the structural features that give diverse functional properties to <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> (Triticum aestivum L.) within a narrow range of enriched amylose content (36 - 43 %). For these starches, which come from a heterogeneous genetic background. SAXS analysis of duplicate samples enabled structural information to be obtained about their lamellar architecture where differences in lamellar spacing among samples were only several tenths of nanometer. The SAXS analysis of these <b>wheat</b> <b>starches</b> with increased amylose content has shown that amylose accumulates in both crystalline and amorphous parts of the lamella. Using waxy starch as a distinctive comparison with the other samples confirmed a general trend of increasing amylose content being linked with the accumulation of defects within crystalline lamellae. We conclude that amylose content directly influences the architecture of semi-crystalline lamellae, whereas thermodynamic and functional properties are {{brought about by the}} interplay of amylose content and amylopectin architecture. © 2008, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} properties of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starches prepared from rice, <b>wheat,</b> and potato <b>starches</b> were studied. Rice and <b>wheat</b> OSA <b>starches</b> {{had significantly higher}} peak viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), and cool paste viscosity (CPV), but potato OSA starch had only significantly higher CPV, relative to the native starch. The gel hardness was higher with lower degree of substitution (DS) but lower with higher DS OSA compared to native starch. The swelling volumes (SV) of rice and <b>wheat</b> OSA <b>starches</b> were significantly higher compared to native starch, but the SV of potato OSA starch was slightly lower at high DS. The gelatinization temperature (GT) of rice OSA starches was sharply lower at low DS; for <b>wheat</b> OSA <b>starch</b> it was slightly lower even at high DS, but potato OSA starches had higher GT than the native starch. The enthalpy of all the OSA starches decreased gradually with increased DS.

However, preheat - setting of gels containing <b>wheat</b> or potato <b>starch</b> had no significant effect on gel strength demonstrating an opposite trend in gel strength due to the differences in swelling power, water holding ability and gelatinization temperature between potato and <b>wheat</b> <b>starches.</b> This difference in gel forming behavior due to the sources of starch and heat- setting prior to cooking correlated with changes {{in the structure of the}} matrix as evidenced by the results of image analysis.

40|$|Physical and {{functional}} properties of starches isolated from 93 noncultivated genotypes of nine Amaranthus species {{from a world}} germ plasm collection and an additional 31 cultivated Amaranthus genotypes obtained from China were tested. A wide variation {{was found in the}} properties tested among the Amaranthus species and among genotypes within the same species. When comparing starches from cultivated and noncultivated genotypes, it was generally found that amylose was lower; starch pasting profiles were more consistent with higher peak viscosity, lower breakdown, and lower setback; the gelatinization temperature was lower; and energy of enthalpy was higher. Under cool storage, the hardness of cultivated starch pastes was lower and the adhesiveness was higher. As expected, amylose content was a primary factor affecting the physical {{and functional}} properties of Amaranthus starch. Compared with reference maize, rice, and <b>wheat</b> <b>starches,</b> Amaranthus starch tended to have lower hot paste viscosity and lower cool paste viscosity; and higher gelatinization temperatures and higher energy of enthalpy.
