25|$|Based on {{academic}} citations, Stiglitz is the 4th most influential economist {{in the world}} in 2013, and in 2011 he was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Stiglitz's work focuses on income distribution from a Georgist perspective, asset risk management, corporate governance, and international trade. He is the author of several books, the latest being The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe (2016), The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>About</b> Them (2015), Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity (2015), and Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth Development and Social Progress (2014).|$|E
25|$|Hartmann {{is also a}} vocal {{critic of}} the effects of {{neoliberal}} globalization on the U.S. economy, claiming that economic policies enacted during and since the presidency of Ronald Reagan have led, in large part, to many American industrial enterprises' being acquired by multinational firms based in overseas countries, leading in many cases to manufacturing jobs'—once considered a major foundation of the U.S. economy—being relocated to countries in Asia and other areas where the costs of labor are lower than in the U.S. and the concurrent reversal of the United States' traditional role of a leading exporter of finished manufactured goods to that of a primary importer of finished manufactured goods (exemplified by massive trade deficits with countries such as China). Hartmann argues that this phenomenon is leading to the erosion of the American middle class, whose survival Hartmann deems critical to the survival of American democracy. This argument is expressed in Hartmann's 2006 book, Screwed: The Undeclared War Against The Middle Class and What <b>We</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>About</b> It. One of the book's main arguments is that media deregulation leads to corporate media's shifting the American consensus towards the acceptance of privatization and massive corporate profits—which causes the shrinking of the middle class.|$|E

500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI.

It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, {{and we wanted to}} do it, then it might have been good."

500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> that as a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

[...] They argue that a single-payer approach is simple, equitable, provides everyone with the same benefits, and saves billions of dollars through economies of scale and simplified administration. They concede that implementing a single-payer system in the United States would be [...] "politically problematic" [...] even though some polls show more satisfaction with the single-payer Medicare system than private insurance.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Wilson and Weber, Ernest Gellner (1974) {{acknowledges}} {{that there are}} drawbacks to {{living in a world}} whose main form of knowledge is confined to facts <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>about</b> and that provide us with no guidelines on how to live and how to organize ourselves.

2500|$|On {{the safety}} {{copy of the}} Basement Tapes, this song was labeled [...] "Answer to Ode". Heylin interprets it as a parody of [...] "Ode to Billie Joe", which was a hit single for Bobbie Gentry in mid-1967 when the {{basement}} songs were being taped. He calls it [...] "as deadpan a deconstruction" [...] of the Gentry hit as the Blonde on Blonde track [...] "4th Time Around" [...] was of The Beatles' [...] "Norwegian Wood". (He adds that, in his view, Dylan generally parodied songs that he liked.) For Heylin, it illustrates Dylan's feeling that folk songs delivered [...] "the underground story". An event with potentially world-shaking implications—"The vice president's gone mad!"—is treated in a detached, stoic manner by the community: [...] "There's nothing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it".

2500|$|During late May 1986 (around {{three weeks}} after Lords' 18th birthday), {{authorities}} discovered she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, {{and the general public}} for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested. (See United States v. X-Citement Video) She was taken into protective custody and hired [...] high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney's investigators searched Lords' Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver's license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken (she was actually fifteen years of age in the photographs). When investigators used Lords' fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to [...] locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984, and telephoned the district attorney's office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, [...] "There isn't anything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
