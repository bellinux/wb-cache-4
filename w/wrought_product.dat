40|$|NASA Langley Research Center has {{successfully}} developed an electron beam freeform fabrication (EBF 3) process, a rapid metal deposition process that works efficiently {{with a variety}} of weldable alloys. The EBF 3 process can be used to build a complex, unitized part in a layer-additive fashion, although the more immediate payoff is for use as a manufacturing process for adding details to components fabricated from simplified castings and forgings or plate products. The EBF 3 process produces structural metallic parts with strengths comparable to that of <b>wrought</b> <b>product</b> forms and has been demonstrated on aluminum, titanium, and nickel-based alloys to date. The EBF 3 process introduces metal wire feedstock into a molten pool that is created and sustained using a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment. Operation in a vacuum ensures a clean process environment and eliminates the need for a consumable shield gas. Advanced metal manufacturing methods such as EBF 3 are being explored for fabrication and repair of aerospace structures, offering potential for improvements in cost, weight, and performance to enhance mission success for aircraft, launch vehicles, and spacecraft. Near-term applications of the EBF 3 process {{are most likely to be}} implemented for cost reduction and lead time reduction through addition of details onto simplified preforms (casting or forging).

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} optimal level of {{residual}} hydrogen in partially de-hydrogenated powder to produce CP-Ti plate compacts using ECAP with back pressure which are subsequently rolled at low temperature. A {{comparative study of}} the compaction of two TiH 2 powders and a CP-Ti powder, with particle sizes 150 u m, 50 u m and 45 u m respectively, has been carried out. The hydride powders have also been compacted in a partially de-hydrogenated state. The optimal level of residual hydrogen {{with respect to the}} density of the resulting compact and the associated mechanical properties has been defined. ECAP at 300 °C produced compacts from these partially de-hydrogenated powders of 99. 5 % theoretical density, while CP-Ti was compacted to almost full theoretical density under the same ECAP conditions. Therefore, the compaction of powder by ECAP does not benefit from temporary hydrogen alloying. These compacts then were rolled at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 500 °C with an 80 % reduction in a single pass. Heat treatment after the rolling can modify the microstructure to improve the resulting mechanical properties and in this regard the temporary alloying with hydrogen has been observed to offer some significant benefits. It is shown the ECAP followed by low temperature rolling is a promising route to the batch production of fully dense CP-Ti <b>wrought</b> <b>product</b> from powder feedstock that avoids the need to subject the material to temperatures greater than 500 °C.

40|$|Several metal honeycombs, termed Linear Cellular Alloys (LCAs), were {{fabricated}} via a {{paste extrusion}} process and thermal treatment. Two Fe-Ni based alloy compositions were evaluated. Maraging steel and Super Invar {{were chosen for}} their compatibility with {{the process and the}} wide range of properties they afforded. Cell wall material was characterized and compared to wrought alloy specifications. The bulk alloy was found to compare well with the more conventionally produced <b>wrought</b> <b>product</b> when porosity was taken into account. The presence of extrusion defects and raw material impurities were shown to degrade properties with respect to wrought alloys. The performance of LCAs was investigated for several alloys and cell morphologies. The results showed that out-of-plane properties exceeded model predictions and in-plane properties fell short due to missing cell walls and similar defects. Strength was shown to outperform several existing cellular metals by as much as an order of magnitude in some instances. Energy absorption of these materials was shown to exceed 150 J/cc at strains of 50 % for high strength alloys. Finally, the suitability of LCAs as an energetic capsule was investigated. The investigation found that the LCAs added significant static strength and as much as three to five times improvement in the dynamic strength of the system. More importantly, it was shown that the pressures achieved with the LCA capsule were significantly higher than the energetic material could achieve alone. High pressures, approaching 3 GPa, coupled with the fragmentation of the capsule during impact increased the likelihood of initiation and propagation of the energetic reaction.

50|$|Aluminium alloys (or {{aluminum}} alloys; see spelling differences) are alloys {{in which}} aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin and zinc.
