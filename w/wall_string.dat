Before she can, Dorothy storms the palace to stop her. While Zelena prepares to finish her with a fireball, Dorothy's dog Toto wanders the room without her noticing. Zelena tosses the fireball at Dorothy, who ducks, with the flame incinerating a guard instead. Toto then pulls at a <b>wall</b> <b>string,</b> making the curtains topple onto Zelena, giving Dorothy time to flee with her dog and the Scarecrow. Blaming the munchkins for Dorothy's return, she tries to intimidate them into giving up the girl's hiding spot, but the munchkins scatter after being frightened by Hades' flaming hair. Hades thanks her for providing him with many souls in the Underworld and later offers to help her find the Scarecrow. Sympathetic to her plight, Hades explains that, he too, has to compete with an older sibling who has everything he wants. Leading her to an area where Dorothy landed in Oz years ago, he persuades Zelena into riding Dorothy's old bicycle with him, until they crash onto the ground, both giddy with laughter. After Zelena puts a tracking spell on the bike, she and Hades find Dorothy at a cottage. When Hades flirts with her, Zelena leans in to kiss him, but the romantic moment is cut short once they spot the Scarecrow. Confronting Dorothy, Zelena works quickly to extract the Scarecrow's brain, but she finds Hades gone. She returns to the palace, where Hades has prepared a celebratory banquet for her. Hades professes {{that he wants to}} be with Zelena, and his belief that a kiss of true love between them can restart his non-beating heart. Zelena rejects him, suspecting he wants the time spell for himself, since only one of them can use it. Believing no one can love her, she reasons that if he does love her, he won't {{stand in the way of}} her revenge. With a tone of finality, she sends him away, warning him to never show his face again.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of confinement-deconfinement (C-D) phase transition {{in the context of}} relativistic heavy-ion collisions within the framework of effective models for the Polyakov loop order parameter. We study the formation of $Z(3) $ <b>walls</b> and associated <b>strings</b> in the initial transition from the confining (hadronic) phase to the deconfining (QGP) phase via the so called Kibble mechanism. Essential physics of the Kibble mechanism is contained in a sort of domain structure arising after any phase transition which represents random variation of the order parameter at distances beyond the typical correlation length. We implement this domain structure by using the Polyakov loop effective model with a first order phase transition and confine ourselves with temperature/time ranges so that the first order C-D transition proceeds via bubble nucleation, leading to a well defined domain structure. The formation of $Z(3) $ <b>walls</b> and associated <b>strings</b> results from the coalescence of QGP bubbles expanding in the confining background. We investigate the evolution of the $Z(3) $ <b>wall</b> and <b>string</b> network. We also calculate the energy density fluctuations associated with $Z(3) $ <b>wall</b> network and <b>strings</b> which decay away after the temperature drops below the quark-hadron transition temperature during the expansion of QGP.

40|$|Domain {{walls are}} sheet-like defects {{produced}} when the low energy vacuum has isolated degenerate minima. The researchers' computer code follows {{the evolution of}} a scalar field, whose dynamics are determined by its Lagrangian density. The topology of the scalar field determines the evolution of the domain walls. This approach treats both wall dynamics and reconnection. The researchers investigated not only potentials that produce single domain walls, but also potentials that produce a network of <b>walls</b> and <b>strings.</b> These networks arise in axion models where the U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken into Z sub N discrete symmetries. If N equals 1, the walls are bounded by strings and the network quickly disappears. For N greater than 1, the network of <b>walls</b> and <b>strings</b> behaved qualitatively just as the wall network shown in the figures given here. This both confirms the researchers' pessimistic view that domain walls cannot {{play an important role in}} the formation of large scale structure and implies that axion models with multiple minimum can be cosmologically disastrous...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{simulations}} {{of the formation}} of domain <b>walls,</b> cosmic <b>strings,</b> and monopoles on a cubic lattice, in which the topological defects are assumed to lie at the zeros of a 1, 2, or 3 component Gaussian random field, respectively. We derive analytic expressions for the corresponding topological defect densities in the continuum limit and show that they fail to agree with simulation results, even when the fields are smoothed on small scales to eliminate lattice effects. We demonstrate that this discrepancy, which is related to a classic geometric fallacy, is due to the anisotropy of the cubic lattice, which cannot be eliminated by smoothing. We derive analytic expressions for the defect densities on a lattice, which do agree with the numerical simulations. We show how to derive a simple multiplicative factor which gives the ratio between the lattice and continuum results for domain <b>walls.</b> For <b>strings</b> and monopoles, the situation is more complicated, but the monopole simulation can be brought into agreement with the continuum prediction by eliminating monopole-antimonopole pairs separated by less than one smoothing length...|$|R
40|$|We use Type Ia supernovae {{studied by}} the High-Z Supernova Search Team to {{constrain}} {{the properties of}} an energy component which {{may have contributed to}} accelerating the cosmic expansion. We find that for a flat geometry the equation of state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x=P_x/rho_x, must be less than - 0. 55 (95 % confidence) for any value of Omega_m and is further limited to alpha_x<- 0. 60 (95 %) if Omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0. 1. These values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topological defects such as domain <b>walls,</b> <b>strings,</b> or textures. The supernova data are consistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=- 1) or a scalar field which has had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmological constant value of - 1 over the redshift range of z= 1 to the present. Supernova and cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints on the densities of matter and the unknown component.

40|$|The Kibble-Zurek {{mechanism}} {{describes the}} evolution of topological defect structures like domain <b>walls,</b> <b>strings,</b> and monopoles when a system is driven through a second order phase transition. The model is used on very different scales like the Higgs field {{in the early universe}} or quantum fluids in condensed matter systems. A defect structure naturally arises during cooling if separated regions are too far apart to `communicate' (e. g. about their orientation or phase) due to finite signal velocity. This results in separated domains with different (degenerated) locally broken symmetry. Within this picture we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics in a condensed matter analogue, a two-dimensional ensemble of colloidal particles. In equilibrium it obeys the so called Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) melting scenario with continuous (second-order like) phase transitions. The ensemble is exposed to a set of finite cooling rates covering roughly three orders of magnitude. Along this process, we analyze the defect and domain structure quantitatively via video microscopy and determine the scaling of the corresponding length scales {{as a function of the}} cooling rate. We indeed observe the scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the KTHNY universality class. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the potential role of string and monopole-type junctions in {{the frustration of}} domain wall networks using a velocity-dependent one-scale model for the characteristic velocity, v, and the characteristic length, L, of the network.

We further show that if domain walls are to provide {{a significant contribution to}} the dark energy without generating exceedingly large CMB temperature fluctuations then, at the present time, the network must have a characteristic length L_ 0 10 Ω_σ 0 ^- 2 / 3 kpc and a characteristic velocity v_ 0 10 ^- 5 Ω_σ 0 ^- 2 / 3 where Ω_σ 0 =ρ_σ 0 /ρ_c 0 and ρ_c is the critical density. In order to satisfy these constraints with Ω_σ 0 ∼ 1, ρ_m 0 would have to be at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than ρ_σ 0, which would be in complete disagreement with observations.
