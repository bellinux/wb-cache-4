Aethalometer® {{was used in the}} measurements of the BC concentrations (with time resolution of 5 s) in the exhaust of a truck model 1995 Dodge RAM 2500 diesel pick-up equipped with an oxidation catalyst. The measurements were made from a chassis dynamometer during the acceleration, deceleration and cruise (constant speed) modes of the hot start of the MEC 01 test cycle (version 7. 0). Exhaust particles were collected in parallel on quartz fiber filters for elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) measurement by the thermal-optical reflectance (TOR) method, and on Teflon® filters for gravimetric total particle mass (PM). Rapid acceleration was accompanied by corresponding instantaneous increases in BC emissions. Under <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>acceleration</b> (WOT), Aethalometer® BC concentrations peaked at 1. 2 mg m- 3, but reduced to only 0. 03 mg m- 3 under cruise conditions at 20 mph.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} a Variable Geometry Turbine at low massflow rates the vaneless space of the vanes is reduced. It is researched if this modification can reduce turbo lag. A turbine with modified vane ring is installed in the exhaust of a naturally aspirated engine and <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>accelerations</b> are performed to test the turbine performance. The new (reduced vaneless space) vane configuration induced a lower exhaust backpressure which allowed the engine to accelerate faster. The acceleration from 1500 to 3000 RPM was an average of 8 % faster for the new vane configuration. This in turn increased the massflow rate through the turbine which caused the power available to the turbine to be similar in compared vane rings. The initial turbine speeds was lower for the new vane configuration but it quickly {{caught up with the}} conventional configuration because the turbine acceleration was higher. The turbine efficiency was higher for the new vane configuration in most cases. The mean increase in turbine efficiency during the initial acceleration was 4 %. The turbine efficiency {{at the end of the}} acceleration was similar for both vane configurations. These experiments indicate that it is probable that decreasing the vaneless space in a variable geometry turbine will increase turbine performance during vehicle acceleration...|$|R

40|$|Ethanol fuel {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} fuel for gasoline engines. The use of ethanol can reduce dependence on fuel from the fraction of hydrocarbons. The use of ethanol as fuel, however, causes increased fuel consumption. This increase {{is a result of}} the low calorific value and a shorter carbon chain. It also raises the value of Reid's vapor, making it difficult to mix with air. Adding swirl generators to the intake manifold aims to make the interior airflow more turbulent. The mixture of fuel with air will also improve. Given these drawbacks, the study analyses the effect of adding a swirl generator to the intake manifold on engine performance, fuel consumption, and emissions produced. The experimentis done on a port injection gasoline engine, four-stroke, SOHC four cylinder connected to the engine dynamometer, which is used to measure the power and emissions produced. To get a good form of swirl generator, experiments were performed using a flow bench. A method has also been developed simultaneously to quantify the swirl characteristics of a swirl generator under steady flow conditions in a flow laboratory using the cylinder head, intake manifold, and swirl generator from the engine experiments. A refined swirl meter is installed under the cylinder head to measure the compressive load of the swirl, allowing for the calculation of angular momentum of the incoming air at varying intake valve lifts, thus producing the swirl number. A correlation is then sought between the engine and flow experiments to help quantify the impact of swirl motion on combustion and cyclic variation. The airflow rate into the cylinder, discharge coefficient of the intake system, and flow loss coefficient across the blockage arealso analyzed for different levels of swirl motion. The validity of this method under steady flow condition is confirmed by comparison of the results with the engine experiments. An engine using ethanol blend fuel has higher fuel consumption, E 10 fuel consumption average increase is 12 %, and E 20 fuel consumption increase is 14 %. Increasing the ethanol content further in fuels however will reduce the emissions productions. Performance in relation to the torque, E 10 in the case Half <b>Open</b> <b>Throttle</b> at 2000 rpm reduces the engine torque by 3. 8 %, at 4000 rpm the engine torque is reduced by 1. 6 %. E 10 in the case of <b>Wide</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Throttle</b> at 2000 rpm reduce the engine torque by 3. 4 %, and at 4000 rpm reduces the torque by 1. 2 %. In the case of E 20 at Half Open Throttleand rpm 2000 the engine torque reduces by 5. 8 %, and at 4000 rpm increases by 2. 7 %.

50|$|Efficiency is {{increased}} {{by having the}} same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio.

This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle.|$|R

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{and emissions}} performance of fuel blends in modern combustion systems {{has been investigated}} {{with the intention of}} reducing emissions, improving efficiency and assessing the suitability of future automotive fuels. The combustion systems used in this study include Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI). By adding a small quantity (10 %) of diesel to gasoline, the HCCI combustion of this ‗Dieseline‘ mixture shows a 4 % increase in the maximum and a 16 % reduction in the minimum loads (IMEP) achievable. The NOX emissions are reduced, with greater than 30 % savings seen for high engine loads. The addition of bio-fuels (ethanol and 2, 5 di-methylfuran) to gasoline in HCCI combustion resulted in reduced ignitability giving rise to a 0. 25 bar IMEP reduction of the maximum load. A 70 % increase in NOX emissions is seen at an engine load of 3. 5 bar IMEP. The addition of ethanol {{and to a lesser extent}} 2, 5 di-methylfuran (DMF) to gasoline in DISI combustion shows increased combustion efficiency. The NOX emissions are reduced with ethanol, but are increased with the addition of DMF. At <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> the bio-fuels show up to a 3 percentage point increase in efficiency through the use of more favourable spark timings brought about by the increased octane ratings and enthalpies of vaporisation.
