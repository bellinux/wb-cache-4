500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E
500|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{also had}} a bombing {{campaign}} ongoing, and in December 1975 Bond [...] "saturated" [...] the centre of London with plainclothes police officers. Four IRA members took two people hostage in Balcombe Street, following a police chase which involved a shoot out on 7 December. The terrorists called the police, in a call which was routed to Bond; who refused their demands of a plane to fly to Ireland, proclaiming that [...] "They are not going anywhere {{and they are not}} getting any plane to Ireland. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make any deals at all." [...] The gunmen gave up on 12 December, their surrender sparking fears of reprisals, after what Bond called a [...] "rather humiliating episode," [...] Bond [...] "masterminded" [...] the operation to regain the hostages. He retired the following year, in 1976, and received the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours list. Upon his retirement in February 1976, he had served in the police for 30 years, full of [...] "exemplary conduct."

500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU {{contacted}} [...] Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith, {{who at the time}} was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies. Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC, quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either. [...] The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944. The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the [...] "customs clause" [...] and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: [...] "We are not going to accept them [...] as fellow workers. ... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work with them. If anybody believe it, let them try it". A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: [...] "Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen".|$|E
500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and some odd thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

In The Immense Journey, Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind.

Consequently, the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery, aggravate social conflict throughout the globe, and intensify man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood. A prolonged 'biological spasm' of our species will follow, ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself, as man has now become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make it.
