This is often done by determining how much wear is caused to a surface by a given wear-inducing object in a given amount of time. Other factors such as surface size, temperature, and pressure are also specified. For two fluids with the same viscosity, the one that results in a smaller <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> is considered to have higher lubricity.

40|$|Among {{the wear}} {{quantification}} techniques applied to point contacts, the most typical one consists of measuring the longitudinal and transversal <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> diameters of the worn surface. However, this method {{does not provide}} information about {{the distribution of the}} wear along the worn surfaces. As a result, the wear prediction using <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> diameters could be misrepresentative because of the irregular shape of the worn surfaces. This drawback should be considered especially when the scope of the test method is the determination of the relative wear preventive properties of lubricants in sliding contacts. This paper compares two hydraulic lubricants from different manufacturers using a four-ball tribometer under the ASTM D 4172 standard. Wear was measured by the <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> diameter and wear volume with an optical 3 D profilometer.

40|$|In this study, {{the role}} of surface {{roughness}} and slide-roll ratio in the decomposition and friction performance of molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC) has been investigated. Tribotests were carried out in a MiniTraction Machine (MTM) using steel discs of varying roughness rubbing against smooth steel balls in a sliding/rolling contact. Tests were conducted at slide-roll ratio (SRR) values of SRR= 100 % and 200 %. Raman spectroscopy was used to perform chemical characterisation on the resulting <b>wear</b> <b>scars.</b> The friction performance of rough discs was not affected by the slide-roll ratio. On the other hand, increasing the slide-roll ratio from 100 % to 200 % in tests with smooth discs resulted in higher friction with large instabilities. Raman analysis showed significant differences in chemical composition of the <b>wear</b> <b>scars</b> generated after tests with smooth and rough discs. <b>Wear</b> <b>scars</b> generated using rough discs were mainly composed of MoS 2 indicating complete MoDTC decomposition while those generated using smooth discs were composed of a mixture of MoS 2, MoSx (x> 2) and FeMoO 4 indicating partial MoDTC decomposition. Numerical simulation of the contact revealed that under similar loading conditions rough surfaces have higher local pressures than smoother surfaces. It is proposed that higher local pressures in rough surfaces promoted complete MoDTC decomposition. The novel finding from results presented {{in this study is}} that at similar temperature and MoDTC concentration, the degradation of MoDTC within tribocontacts is highly dependent on the roughness of the tribopair.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{that have}} carried out fretting wear tests have presented results which show a variation (usually an increase) in the friction force during the sliding phase of individual cycles. This phenomenon {{is contrary to}} the Amontons/Coulomb model of friction which predicts a constant friction force as sliding proceeds. An in-line fretting test involving an abrupt increase in amplitude was used to show that the effect is a result of <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> interaction effects. A pair of rotational fretting tests were then carried out to determine whether these interaction effects originate from interaction of the <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> ends, or whether such interaction occurs throughout the nominal contact area. A new experimental rig designed to adapt conventional in-line test machines for rotational fretting was designed and built for this purpose. Results show that the friction variation occurs whether or not <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> ends are present. After testing, the worn surface topography of each fretting pair was scanned using a focus variation microscope, and these surface images revealed the existence (and size) of many distributed local peaks and troughs distributed throughout the contact area. In conclusion, the friction variation commonly observed in the literature arises predominantly from the interaction of local <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> features distributed over the contact region. © (2011) Trans tech publications Switzerland...|$|E

40|$|The current wear-testing {{standard}} (ISO 18192 - 1) {{for total}} disc replacement (TDR) requires only four {{degrees of freedom}} (DOF) inputs: axial load, flexion–extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. The study aim {{was to assess the}} effect of an additional DOF, anterior–posterior (AP) shear on the wear of the ProDisc-L TDR. A 5 DOF simulator was used to test ProDisc-L implants under 4 DOF and 5 DOF conditions. The 4 DOF conditions were defined by ISO 18192 - 1 whilst the 5 DOF used ISO 18192 - 1 conditions with the addition of an AP load of + 175 and − 140  N (anterior and posterior, respectively), extrapolated from in vivo data. The implants were mounted such that the polyethylene insert could be removed for gravimetric measurements. Tests were run using bovine serum (15  g/l protein concentration) as a lubricant for five million cycles (MC), with measurements repeated every 1  MC. The mean wear rate in the 4 DOF test was 12. 7  ±  2. 1  mg/MC compared to 11. 6  ±  1. 2  mg/MC in the 5 DOF test.

Fretting wear {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of the}} contacting shapes of spacer grid springs on the wear behavior of a nuclear fuel rod in room temperature air and water. The main objective was to quantitatively compare the wear behavior of the nuclear fuel rod with the variation of the contacting spring shapes. The variation of the real worn area in the <b>wear</b> <b>scar,</b> the change in the wear volume and the maximum wear depth with the slip amplitude were calculated and measured through an optical micrometer and surface profilometry. The results of the wear tests showed that the wear volume and the maximum wear depth were sensitively affected by each spring shape with increasing slip amplitude and with a change of the test environment. From the analysis of the <b>wear</b> <b>scar,</b> it is possible to separate the size of the <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> from the real worn area and the transferred one. In addition, we found that the wear volume has a linear relation with the real worn area rather than the size of the <b>wear</b> <b>scar</b> and this was only determined by using each spring shape even though the wear tests were carried out with different conditions. From the above results, it is possible to evaluate a wear resistant spring by using the correlation between the variation of the real worn area and the wear behavior at each spring shape...|$|E
