40|$|Background. Few {{community-based}} {{studies have}} examined the impact of life events, life conditions and life changes on the course of depression. This paper oxamines associations of life events on depressive symptom onset, improvement, and stability. Methods. Direct interview data from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), a 4 - 5 year prospective- longitudinal design based on a representative community sample of adolescents and young adults, aged 14 - 24 years at baseline, are used. Life events were measured using the Munich Event- Questionnaire (MEL) consisting of 83 explicit items from various social role areas and subscales for the assessment of life event clusters categorized according to dimensions such as positive and negative and controllable and uncontrollable. Depressive disorders were assessed with the DSM-IV version of the Munich Composite Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). Multiple logistic regression analyses examined the effects of 22 predictors on the course of depression (onset, improvement, stability). Results. Younger age, low social class, negative and stressful life events linked to the family were associated with increased risk of new onset of depression. Anxiety was a significant independent predictor of new onset of depression. Absence of stressful school and family events was related to improvement in depression. The <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> number of <b>life</b> events predicted stable depression. Conclusions. The association between life events and the course of depression appears to vary according to the outcome being examined, with different clusters of life events differentially predicting onset, improvement, and. stability.

It is assumed that job processing time is unknown random variable before the actual occurrence of this time, where probability distribution of such a variable between the given lower and upper bounds is unknown before scheduling. We develop the dominance relations {{on a set of}} jobs J. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a job domination may be tested in polynomial time of the number n = |J| of jobs. If there is no a domination within some subset of set J, heuristic procedure to minimize the <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> flow time is used for sequencing the jobs from such a subset. The computational experiments for randomly generated single-machine scheduling problems with n ≤ 700 show that the developed dominance relations are quite helpful in minimizing the <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> flow time of n jobs with uncertain processing times...|$|R

We obtain existence of this type of solutions via a suitable approximation of the energy functional with Laplacians and an extra regularization of the <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> variation term of the energy. As a byproduct of this result, we also prove some Γ-convergence results concerning <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> variations and the corresponding time-dependent cases.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose to {{investigate}} {{the use of a}} vectorial total variation model with spatially varying regularization and data terms for color image denoising and restoration. We pay attention to two main minimization problems: the minimization of a <b>weighted</b> vectorial <b>total</b> variation term TVg, which acts as a regularization term, using the L 2 norm as data term or the minimization of the vectorial total variation with a spatially varying L 1 g norm. The optimization process takes benefit of convex optimization tools by introducing an augmented Lagrangian formulation.

In this paper, We propose to study more particularly the impact of spatially varying terms (total variation term or data terms) for color image restoration.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> least squares (WTLS) -based estimator into image registration {{to deal with}} the coordinates of control points (CPs) that are of unequal accuracy. The performance of the estimator is investigated by means of simu-lation experiments using different coordinate errors. Comparisons with ordinary least squares (LS), total LS (TLS), scaled TLS, and weighted LS estimators are made. A novel adaptive weight deter-mination scheme is applied to experiments with remotely sensed images. These illustrate the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed registration method by collecting CPs with different-sized errors from multiple reference images with different spatial resolutions. This paper concludes that the WTLS-based itera-tively reweighted TLS method achieves a more robust estimation of model parameters and higher registration accuracy if het-eroscedastic errors occur in both the coordinates of reference CPs and target CPs.

40|$|Based on the Newton-Gauss {{iterative}} algorithm of <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> {{least squares}} (WTLS), a robust WTLS (RWTLS) model is presented. The model utilizes the standardized residuals {{to construct the}} weight factor function and the square root of the variance component estimator with robustness is obtained by introducing the median method. Therefore, the robustness in both the observation and structure spaces can be simultaneously achieved. To obtain standardized residuals, the linearly approximate cofactor propagation law is employed to derive {{the expression of the}} cofactor matrix of WTLS residuals. The iterative calculation steps for RWTLS are also described. The experiment indicates that the model proposed in this paper exhibits satisfactory robustness for gross errors handling problem of WTLS, the obtained parameters have no significant difference with the results of WTLS without gross errors.

A partial semigroup property relating the weight function and the solution is shown and analytic solutions for simply data functions are computed. We prove that the <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> variation minimisation problem is well-posed even in the case of vanishing weight function, despite the lack of coercivity. This is {{based on the fact that}} the total variation of the solution is bounded by the total variation of the data, a result that it also shown here.

Results <b>Total</b> <b>life</b> expectancy at birth increased in South Australia for both sexes (2. 0 years [2. 6 %] among males; 1. 5 years [1. 8 %] among females). Healthy life expectancy also increased (1. 4 years [2. 1 %] among males; 1. 2 years [1. 5 %] among females). <b>Total</b> <b>life</b> and healthy life expectancy gains were apparent in all socioeconomic groups, with the largest increases in areas of most and least disadvantage. While the least disadvantaged areas consistently had the best health outcomes, they also experienced the largest increase {{in the amount of}} life expectancy lived with disease and injury-related illness.

The unconstrained minimization problem {{is transformed into}} a saddle-point problem by introducing a suitable auxiliary unknown.

The auxiliary unknown is computed explicitly. Numerical experiments show the availability of our algorithm for salt and pepper noise removal or shape retrieval and also its robustness against the choice of the penalty parameter. This last property allows us to attain the convergence in a reduced number of iterations leading to efficient numerical schemes.

Due to the <b>weighted</b> <b>total</b> variation, some nonstandard terms appear in the mathematical expressions of this system, and such nonstandard terms have made the mathematical treatments to be quite delicate.
