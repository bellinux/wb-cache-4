5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E

5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
25|$|Kahn {{rested his}} theory upon two premises, one obvious, one highly controversial. First, nuclear war <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> feasible, since the United States and the Soviet Union {{currently}} had massive nuclear arsenals aimed at each other. Second, {{like any other}} war, it was winnable.|$|E
25|$|McNaught {{states that}} one Hugh Lamberton, a {{merchant}} of Glasgow, left £300 {{in the early}} 19th century as the Lamberton Mortification {{to be used to}} provide fuel, food or clothing for the local poor. He may have come from Townhead of Lambroughton, as he <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a man with strong local connections.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish cavalry was {{composed}} of 53 small companies, assembled into ad hoc squadrons. There were 29 cuirassier companies and 24 arquebusier companies. All except 4 veteran cuirassier companies had been raised in 1621 and 1622. They were composed by Walloon recruits and they had performed poorly at the Battle of Wimpfen, so Cordoba <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> concerned about the flanks of his army.|$|E
25|$|The fart-in-the-bath {{story was}} trotted {{out last year}} in an episode of Stephen Fry's {{otherwise}} admirable quiz show QI. It (the story) first appeared some twenty {{years ago in a}} newspaper article, to which my father immediately wrote a rebuttal. This <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> ferreted out by some BBC researcher. It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it just isn't true.|$|E
25|$|Coming off {{a regular}} season conference title, the team <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> dejected in not going further, and this served as {{something}} of a chip of their shoulder heading into the next season. In the stands, the club experienced another solid but unspectacular year averaging 5,983 (announced), but dipped well below that during the post season, seeing only 4,638 show up for the conference final game versus St. Louis.|$|E

25|$|It may be {{important}} to note that the Karaite and Rabbanite communities may have been theologically at odds, but often maintained good social and economic relations during the 10–13th centuries in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. It <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> as important for the Karaite grocer to do business with Rabbanite customers as it was for the latter to be able to rely on the religious acceptability of his products.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{accepted}} the respondents' argument {{that there was}} no substantial change in factual circumstances. While there <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> an increase in Board expenditures in maintaining their program, the Court noted that cost increases were not only predicted in Aguilar, they had been practically guaranteed. Furthermore, since the applicable case law had not changed since the Aguilar decision, there was nothing the Court could see as constituting a substantial change in factual circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Navy's {{interest}} in the variable-geometry wing was based on concerns that the ever-increasing weight of its jet fighters was making aircraft carrier operations troublesome. Many of its existing aircraft already had marginal carrier performance, and the trend in weight growth <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> upward. At the same time, the demands for high-speed performance demanded swept wing layouts that did not lend themselves to good takeoff characteristics. The prospect of combining the two in a single aircraft was enticing.|$|E

25|$|Apart from Abalabandhab, Dwarkanath {{raised a}} storm within the Brahmo Samaj {{regarding}} {{the issue of}} women sitting behind the screen during prayer meetings. With his strong reformist views, he <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> opposed {{to many of the}} conservative ideas not only in society but even in the Brahmo Samaj. That {{was the beginning of the}} split in the Brahmo Samaj of India, which ultimately led to the formation of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. Ganguly served several terms as secretary of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj.|$|E
25|$|Stone was {{the basis}} for a major {{character}} in John Hay's 1883 anti-union novel The Breadwinners. In response to Hay's novel, journalist Henry Francis Keenan (a former colleague of Hay's at the New-York Tribune) published The Money-Makers in 1885. The novel was an attack on robber barons and industrialists, and its main character was an idealistic journalist who marries into a wealthy family and abandons his progressive values for greed, power, and materialism. John Hay clearly inspired the main character, and Amasa Stone <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> the basis for the grasping, cruel industrialist Aaron Grimestone.|$|E
25|$|Noda {{pulled in}} to retire, and Mansell {{eventually}} {{had to come}} in for a new nosecone, ruining his race and denting his reputation. Noda's luck would then get no better at his home race in Japan, where he qualified 23rd, once again only one spot off Comas, although this time he was only 0.013s behind the Frenchman. His experience at Suzuka <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> paying rich dividends, but when torrential rain drenched the circuit on race day, it would suddenly be a whole new ball game.|$|E

25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> wrong.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{made two}} unsuccessful attempts {{on the summit}} in early June, and there was time for one more before the heavy snowfall {{that came with the}} summer monsoon would make climbing too dangerous. This last chance fell to the expedition's most experienced climber, George Mallory. To the surprise of other expedition members, Mallory chose the 22-year-old inexperienced Irvine above the older, more seasoned climber, Noel Odell. Irvine's proficiency with the oxygen equipment <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a major factor in Mallory's decision, but there has been some debate ever since about the precise reasons for his choice.|$|E
25|$|Oddly enough, the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never {{mentions}} the map although it <b>was</b> <b>obviously</b> a national project. Another interesting {{fact is that}} this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned {{the use of the}} era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.|$|E
