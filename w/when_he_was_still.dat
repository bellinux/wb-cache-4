5|$|Nikolai Ge {{was born}} in Voronezh City, to a Russian noble family of French origin. His {{grandfather}} emigrated to Russia in the 18th century. His parents died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a child, so Nikolai was raised by his serf nurse. He graduated from the First Kiev Gymnasium and studied at the physics-mathematics department of Kiev University and Saint Petersburg University.|$|E

5|$|Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was {{nominated}} on 23May and was probably consecrated on 25December. The appointment of Thomas was a departure for the King, who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> Duke of Normandy. The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{documents}} {{about him}} vanished at the Levoča fire in 1550. So, neither his surname, nor dates or places {{of birth and}} death are known. It <b>is</b> assumed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born between 1470 and 1480. He must have died between 1537 (<b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> mentioned on record) and 1542 (when his widow is mentioned).|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} World War II {{broke out in}} 1939, Boosey & Hawkes had also signed Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland. It was Ralph Hawkes who championed Britten <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{relatively}} unknown, often against {{the rest of the}} board of directors, until the première on 7 June 1945 of Peter Grimes, which was a critical and popular success. Sheet music sales soared during the War, enabling Boosey & Hawkes to buy Editions Russes which held the rights to the most valuable works of Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. The company also purchased the lease of the Royal Opera House in London in 1944, rescuing it from becoming a permanent dance hall and providing a venue for world-class ballet and opera in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{was born}} in Panama City, into a {{relatively}} poor mestizo, or mixed-race, family with Native American, African, and Spanish heritage. Noriega's mother has been variously described as a cook or a laundress, while his father, Ricaurte Noriega, was an accountant. Neither had a lengthy presence in his life: his mother died of tuberculosis <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a child. Noriega was brought up by a godmother in a one-room apartment in the slum area of Terraplén. Authors and journalists have suggested that Noriega {{was in fact the}} illegitimate son of his father and his father's domestic worker, whose family name was Moreno.|$|E
5|$|Obama is a {{supporter}} of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E

40|$|Inspiration is {{necessary}} for the processes of discovery not to run down and come to a dead stop. Inspiration comes along with, or as a result of, insight: the power of seeing into an event. It often comes to a man <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> and far away from tumult and excessive agitation, whether physical (such as loud music, crowds), mental (excitement, thoughts whizzing madly away, daydreams), or spiritual (hatred, jealousy, criticism).

5|$|Sephiroth is {{revealed}} in Final Fantasy VII {{to be the result}} of an experiment by the megacorporation Shinra, in which they injected him with cells from the extraterrestrial lifeform Jenova <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a fetus. Upon discovering this, Sephiroth decides to follow what he believes to be his destiny and take control of the Planet, whilst Cloud and the game's other protagonists attempt to stop him.

5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of coins {{deposited}} {{at the beginning of}} Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|E

5|$|After {{only one}} {{professional}} fight, Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, signing for Rushden & Diamonds, who were {{playing in the}} Conference National, the highest-tier of non-league football. His boxing licence was suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control, following a conviction for assaulting a police officer whilst drunk and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> playing for Grimsby Town, and not under the BBBofC's jurisdiction {{at the time of}} the incident. He was ordered to pay £100 compensation to PC Andrew Whitehead and £350 in costs. Woodhouse chose to play for Rushden & Diamonds to fulfil a promise he made to someone who was part of the consortium that took over the Irthlingborough based club. He made his debut against Aldershot Town on 25 November 2006, in a 1–0 defeat. He made five appearances in the Conference National for Rushden, before deciding to leave to concentrate on his boxing career.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E

He changed his name to Masutatsu Oyama (大山倍達) and went across the country, defeating martial artists one after another. This film concentrates on the period <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> young, and developing his famous karate style, Kyokushin. The film was the seventh highest grossing Korean film of 2004 with 2,346,446 admissions sold nationwide.|$|R

5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E
5|$|Hafizullah Amin {{was born}} to a Ghilzai Pashtun family in Paghman on 1 August 1929. His father, a civil servant, died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both primary and {{secondary}} school, which in turn allowed him to attend Kabul University (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the Darul Mualimeen Teachers College in Kabul, and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious Avesina High School, and in 1957 left Afghanistan for Columbia University in New York City, where he earned M. A. in education. It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to Marxism, and in 1958 he {{became a member of}} the university's Socialist Progressive Club. When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School. During this period Amin became acquainted with Nur Muhammad Taraki, a communist. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> trying to find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E
