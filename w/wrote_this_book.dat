25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} article Hogg <b>wrote,</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> covered periods of Shelley's life that Hogg had only learned about secondhand. The Shelley family helped him by providing Percy Shelley's papers {{to him for}} use in his research. Percy Shelley's sisters Helen and Margaret also contributed accounts of childhood memories involving their brother. Hogg was known for the strength and clarity of his memory, {{and was able to}} recall minor details from the time that he spent with Percy Shelley. The initial plan was to release a four-volume work and the first two volumes of the book were published in 1858 by Edward Moxon. The text of Shelley at Oxford was included in the work, and comprised roughly one sixth of the final document.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
25|$|Ryerson's major {{contribution}} {{was as a}} Marxist historian and {{it was here that}} Ryerson was to find his voice. The Canadian bourgeoisie's dismissal of Communism generally states that it is an alien importation and as such has no basis within Canadian society. By stressing the progressive nature of the Canadian past, the CPC hoped to prove the validity of its existence within Canadian society. During this period, numerous articles and pamphlets were published by the CPC, {{but it was not until}} the 1937 publication of Stanley Ryerson's 1837-The Birth of Canadian Democracy, that the full Marxist analysis of the on the 1837 Rebellions would appear. 1837 should be viewed as a work of Marxist historiography written for a working-class audience and not for academia; since Ryerson <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> so it could be used as a weapon in the struggle of working people to build a qualitatively different and better world. Ryerson's rationale for writing this book, as was the rationale for all his works, can be best summarised as an exploration of Canadian history with the hopes of educating the working-class, in a sense it was an exercise in the raising of class consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{also criticized}} {{scientific}} types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, {{when asked about}} his newly published book , Wilson commented: I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college....|$|E

2500|$|His {{approach}} was something new. There had been criticisms of Shakespeare before, but either {{they were not}} comprehensive or they were not aimed at the general reading public. As Ralph Wardle put it, before Hazlitt <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> [...] "no one had ever attempted a comprehensive study of all of Shakespeare, play by play, that readers could read and reread with pleasure {{as a guide to}} their understanding and appreciation". Somewhat loosely organised, and even rambling, the studies offer personal appreciations of the plays that are unashamedly enthusiastic. Hazlitt does not present a measured account of the plays' strengths and weaknesses, as did Dr. Johnson, or view them in terms of a [...] "mystical" [...] theory, as Hazlitt thought his contemporary A.W. Schlegel did (though he approves of many of Schlegel's judgements and quotes him liberally). Without apology, he addresses his readers as fellow lovers of Shakespeare and shares with them the beauties of what he thought the finest passages of the plays he liked best.|$|E
