5|$|The 10-minute {{murder scene}} which forms the film's climax is scored with almost {{the whole of}} the Act II duet between Otello and Iago from Giuseppe Verdi's Otello.

Thus the astute spectator <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> with two dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.|$|E
