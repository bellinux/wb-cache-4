5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him {{trying to get back}} to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in {{the last part of the}} lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at all during the session.|$|E

25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{virtually}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.|$|E

25|$|Artists at the {{forefront}} of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further. A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907. By 1907, representational form gave <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.|$|E
25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{practically}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Salon des Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, representational form gave <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.|$|E
25|$|Planning and {{architecture}} {{went through a}} paradigm shift {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s many African {{students}} were studying in British universities, and they produced {{a demand for}} new scholarship, and started themselves to supply it as well. Oxford University became the main center for African studies, with activity as well at Cambridge University and the London School of Economics. The perspective of British government policymakers or international business operations slowly gave <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> interest {{in the activities of}} the natives, especially nationalistic movements and the growing demand for independence. The major breakthrough came from Ronald Robinson and John Andrew Gallagher, especially with their studies of the impact of free trade on Africa. In 1985 The Oxford History of South Africa (2 vols.) was published, attempting to synthesize the available materials. In 2013, The Oxford Handbook of Modern African History was published, bringing the scholarship up to date.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand won the toss {{and elected}} to bat, {{immediately}} demonstrating a reshuffling of their batting order, with Guptill facing the first ball from Anderson, presumably to protect Ronchi, who fell so {{quickly in the}} previous match. However, Ronchi was soon on strike and just as soon {{on his way back}} to the pavilion, Anderson clean-bowling him with the last ball of the third over. Guptill was almost out himself on 13 in the 10th over, but his low pull shot was dropped by Trott at midwicket. It was a mistake that would prove costly for England, as Guptill went on to put on successive 100-run stands for the second and third wickets with Williamson (55) and Taylor (60) on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> Zealand record 189 not out off 155 balls. Captain Brendon McCullum put on 40 runs himself to close out New Zealand's 50 overs with the team on 359/3.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, in {{testimony}} before Congress, Shoup made {{many of the}} same points as he had in his 1966 speech, saying he felt opposition to the war had likely increased since then. In April 1969, along with retired Colonel James Donovan, he broadened his criticism to national security policy. In an article published in Atlantic Monthly, he accused America of becoming militaristic and aggressive, and was a country ready to [...] "execute military contingency plans and to seek military solutions to problems of political disorder and potential Communist threats in areas of our interest." [...] He said that anticommunism had given <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> aggressive defense establishment in the United States.|$|E

After five hours, most of the attendees had become bored and left; workmen arrived to dismantle the stage, despite Mellor's protests {{that he was on}} his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> record. According to Adrian Tame of the Sunday Herald Sun, Mellor retired after that experience, [...] "disillusioned and broken-hearted," [...] but with his dignity and manhood intact. Mellor had hoped to organise an annual national competition held in his home town of Barnsley, and offered a prize of £100 to anyone who could beat him.|$|E
500|$|The first Western Australian to win Olympic gold, O'Halloran learnt {{to swim in}} his {{hometown}} of Katanning. He moved to Perth to attend secondary schooling at Guildford Grammar School, where he became more committed to swimming. Competitive swimming was not well developed in Western Australia; races were held in muddy river pools. So in late 1955, O'Halloran moved to the east coast to support his attempt to qualify for the Olympics. His new coach, Frank Guthrie, overhauled his training regimen, and within a year O'Halloran had reduced his times by approximately ten percent. He gained Olympic selection in the relay and the 400-metre freestyle. O'Halloran led off the Australian quartet on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> world record, before placing sixth in the 400-metre.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} combat system was more {{responsive}} {{than in previous}} games, particularly praising {{the addition of the}} cover system. Justin Calvert of GameSpot wrote that the cover system makes the game's combat a [...] "huge improvement" [...] over previous games. Reiner of Game Informer agreed, writing that the targeting system makes players feel responsible for all deaths. IGN's Goldstein praised the fluidity of the cover system, and felt that the auto aim mechanic is a [...] "great help in larger battles". GamesRadar's Walter wrote that the cover system has [...] "paved the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> style of mission". David McComb of Empire called the combat [...] "sharp and instinctive", and Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the cover system allows players to execute an attack plan. In addition to the combat system, most reviewers noted the vehicle handling was more realistic than in previous games. Robinson of Computer and Video Games felt that the vehicle handling echoed realism, while Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine called the vehicle selection [...] "excellent". Costantino of Game Revolution praised the improvement of the game's mechanics, particularly the physics engine's advanced vehicle and character animations.|$|E

500|$|While {{traveling}} to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where his family would stay while {{he returned to}} combat in Vietnam, Jabara and his 16-year-old daughter Carol Anne {{died in a car}} accident in Delray Beach, Florida, on 17 November 1966. The Jabara family were in two cars that day, on their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> home in South Carolina where his wife Nina and their children—James Jr., Carol Anne, Jeanne, and Cathy—would reside during Jabara's combat tour. Carol Anne was driving a Volkswagen with her father as a passenger in the back seat. She lost control of the car going through a construction zone, when she initially veered onto a grass median. She swerved back onto the highway but during the rapid turn, she lost control and the vehicle returned to the median where it rolled several times. Jabara sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at a Delray hospital, and Carol Anne died two days later. A memorial service was held for Jabara at Homestead Air Force Base with a missing man formation fly-by. Jabara and his daughter were buried together in a single grave at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{the first}} quarter of the 19th century, {{religious}} instruction in Sunday schools took the form of rote memorization of extensive passages from the Bible or the catechism; pupils might be tasked with memorizing as many as 300 verses a week.
