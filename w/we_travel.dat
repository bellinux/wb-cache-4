500|$|With rare praise, Johnson said of Pennant [...] "... he's {{the best}} {{traveller}} I ever read; he observes more things {{than anyone else}} does." [...] And in 1777, Johnson said to Boswell [...] "Our ramble in the islands hangs upon my imagination. I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again. Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see. When <b>we</b> <b>travel</b> again let us look better about us." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{elsewhere in}} Latin America was also enthusiastic. One of the book's first reviewers was María Rosa Oliver, {{writing in the}} influential Argentine journal Sur shortly after the novel's second edition was produced in Buenos Aires. She particularly praises the plot: {{the fact that the}} novel is more than simply a lyrical still life. Rather, she argues, [...] "stirs our five senses." [...] And her conclusion stresses the book's Latin American qualities, arguing that it [...] "enchants us, stirs us, moves us, and softens us all at the same time, producing much the same effect as when <b>we</b> <b>travel,</b> eyes and heart wide open, around these Latin American lands or the pages that tell their history." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 6, to {{determine}} the stress components [...] acting on a plane [...] at an angle [...] counterclockwise to the plane [...] on which [...] acts, <b>we</b> <b>travel</b> an angle [...] in the same counterclockwise direction around the circle from the known stress point [...] to point , i.e., an angle [...] between lines [...] and [...] in the Mohr circle.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>travelled</b> {{two days}} towards those hills, and still they seemed as far off {{as they did}} at first, {{and it was the}} fifth day before we got to them; indeed, <b>we</b> <b>travelled</b> but softly, for it was {{excessively}} hot; and we were much about the very equinoctial line, we hardly knew whether to the south or the north of it.|$|R
6000|$|Thus, {{because of}} our ancient prescience of each other's trail of thought, <b>we</b> <b>travelled</b> ambiguously {{to the point where}} Kansas Bill's story began: ...|$|R

2500|$|Examining {{the frame}} above, {{we can see}} that the {{coordinate}} [...] is inessential; our spacetime is the direct product of a factor R with a signature -++ three-manifold.

2500|$|As he speaks, we {{transfer}} to the Sun, and watching a sunspot spin into view, we dive into and pass through the chromosphere, and head toward the center. The mentor lays down {{the basis of our}} story as <b>we</b> <b>travel</b> through the Sun. He explains that the [...] "man in the sun is called the Core (voiced by William Shatner)" [...] and spins a story how he is good and that his children [...] "photons" [...] are sent out to chase away the darkness, and bring life, warmth, and knowledge to Earth. He adds that the only being who does not like the Core is a creature called the [...] "Void" [...] (voiced by Mark Hamill) who is an ancient, malevolent, being who existed before the Big Bang, and who sits {{at the edge of the}} solar system, scheming to stop the Core.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first period}} {{occurred}} in the 1950s when Sun Ra's music evolved from big band swing into the outer-space-themed [...] "cosmic jazz" [...] {{for which he was}} best known. Music critics and jazz historians say some of his best work was recorded during this period and it is also some of his most accessible music. Sun Ra's music in this era was often tightly arranged and sometimes reminiscent of Duke Ellington's, Count Basie's, or other important swing music ensembles. However, there was a strong influence from post-swing styles like bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, and touches of the exotic and hints of the experimentalism that dominated his later music. Notable Sun Ra albums from the 1950s include Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth, Interstellar Low Ways, Super-Sonic Jazz, <b>We</b> <b>Travel</b> the Space Ways, The Nubians of Plutonia and Jazz In Silhouette.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do we come here?" [...] Roger asked. [...] "It {{would surely}} have been much shorter had <b>we</b> <b>travelled</b> through Berwick, and along the coast road." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>travelled</b> for {{the most}} part alone and {{generally}} in complete silence, for I was too far in advance to have any conversation with my partner.|$|R

2500|$|Deng Ai had a {{different}} opinion. He said, [...] "The defeat at {{the west of the}} Tao River wasn't an insignificant loss. The loss of troops and officers, depletion of stores and reserves, and displacement of refugees are signs pointing towards imminent destruction. I shall explain the situation. First, the enemy is riding on a wave of victories, while we're actually weak. Second, the enemy forces are well-trained and battle-ready, while ours are newly recruited and not well-equipped. Third, the enemy is less tired than us because <b>we</b> <b>travel</b> by land while they travel by water. Fourth, the enemy focuses on attacking Didao only, while we spread our defences across four locations – Didao, Longxi (隴西), Nan'an (南安; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu). Fifth, Nan'an and Longxi have grain produced by the Qiang people, while there are fields of wheat beyond Mount Qi. The enemy is cunning. They'll definitely come for the wheat." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus <b>we</b> <b>travelled</b> {{for several}} days without {{anything}} particular occurring, and at length arrived at a native village which lay {{on the banks of}} a noble stream.|$|R
6000|$|And on that morning, {{through the}} grass, [...] And by the {{steaming}} rills, [...] 10 [...] <b>We</b> <b>travelled</b> merrily, to pass [...] A day among the hills.|$|R
