40|$|Executive Summary *The {{success of}} the company should be {{understood}} as the {{success of the}} business enterprise which it conducts. *Qualifying employees should be recognised by statute as members of the company and any group that employs them. The company can then be understood as the legal reflection of the human community of enterprise that produces goods and services and serves customers and society as a whole. Deemed employee membership would empower directors to pursue {{the success of the}} enterprise in which long-term shareholders and workers have a common interest. Without it, s. 172 is a dead letter. *Such recognition would not be sufficient without some transfer of sovereignty over takeover decisions from shareholders to <b>directors</b> and <b>workers.</b> <b>Directors</b> need to be free to pursue the success of the enterprise without the threat of hostile takeover. Furthermore, since an enterprise may be worth more to shareholders dead than alive, the consent of workers as well as of long-term shareholders should be required for takeovers recommended by the directors. *The election of <b>worker</b> <b>directors</b> follows naturally from the recognition of deemed membership and this understanding of success helps to overcome the conflicts of interest. Trade unions should play a complementary but separate role...|$|R

40|$|This {{synoptic}} paper accompanies refereed articles, {{chapters in}} books and books published between 1977 and 2001 by the author {{on the theme of}} trade union, managerial, and employee perceptions of organisational participation and democracy at work and is submitted for a PhD by Publication. It shows how these eleven publications represent a "substantial, continuous and coherentb ody of work" on the theme and demonstratesh ow they, both individually and collectively, have made an original contribution to knowledge in this specific field. The author distinguishes between direct participation and indirect or representative forms of organisational participation and claims to have made a contribution to both. During the period spanned by these twelve publications, perceptions of trade unions, management and employees about organisational participation and democracy at work have undergone great changes. In the 1970 s, trade union perceptions of organisational participation and democracy at work led the TUC among others to campaign for worker directors as a form of industrial democracy to influence boardroom decisions outside the scope of collective bargaining. The Labour government of the day supported the TUC initiative with the Committee of Inquiry on Industrial Democracy chaired by Lord Bullock. The author contributed to the national debate on worker directors with the publication of his book on the British Steel Worker Directors. He also researched direct forms of employee participation such as job enrichment, job enlargement, and autonomous working groups internationally, arguing for their incorporation in industry. When the Conservative Party came to power, the <b>worker</b> <b>director</b> avenue to indirect employee participation at boardroom level was effectively blocked. The author then turned his research attention to management-led forms of direct employee participation, namely Quality Circles and Total Quality Management with their forms of employee empowerment. His publications also foster participation for leavers and survivors in corporate downsizing. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

I also conduct an event study of stockholders’ reactions to required changes in the board size and composition of German firms over the last 20 years.

We recount the theoretical arguments for and against this form of codetermination, and survey the evolving empirical evidence as to its economic impact. Even if theory and the more recent empirical findings hold out the prospect that the apparatus of good corporate governance might include employee representation on company boards, caveats attach {{to the extent of}} representation and the composition of the worker side. But even if the entity has performed better than its external reputation might indicate, it is clearly in the process of adapting to change. In particular, the availability of alternative forms of corporate governance will increasingly shape the German institution. codetermination, <b>worker</b> <b>directors,</b> board-level employee representation, firm performance, legal arbitrage, Germany...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} solidarity in {{the sense}} of social solidarity. The debate relates to issues of social inclusion and belonging. Departing from a critique of the economization of society, it considers solidarity in a sense that is broader than that of economic form. The paper refers to ideology and organization of labour in socialism, to meanings attributed to work {{as well as to the}} factor, to its role in constructing a community, its infrastructure, the social- and symbol-scape, to the changing relations between economy, market and state in the context of contemporary political and economic reconfigurations, to social transformations, and to processes of individualization within the self-responsibility paradigm. The paper is based on material gathered through field work (at the spinning factory of Litija) and interviews conducted with blue and white collar <b>workers,</b> <b>directors</b> and managers inSlovenia(between 2000 and 2011). The aim is to seek spaces for solidarity in socialism and in post-socialist time, and to see possibilities for thinking about it in the future...|$|R

It evaluates the educational experience and performance of a sample of `difficult' adolescents living in foster families, residential children's homes and residential special schools for pupils with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD). The book addresses factors such as the failure to prioritise education {{for children in}} care, placement instability and disrupted schooling. It investigates care environments, policy changes and young people's background experiences - as well as the costs of services - in order to gauge the effectiveness of targeted initiatives. The authors adopt a multidisciplinary approach to suggest how best to support children in care in educational settings. This book will be essential reading for professionals supporting children in care, including social <b>workers,</b> <b>directors</b> of children's services, policy makers, school leaders, teachers and managers in the public, voluntary and private sectors.
