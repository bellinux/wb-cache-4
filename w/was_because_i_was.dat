500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Michael said he {{had hidden}} the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. In 2009 Michael said: [...] "My {{depression}} {{at the end of}} Wham! <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> beginning to realize I was gay, not bisexual." ...|$|E

"If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> and you <b>are</b> you <b>because</b> you <b>are</b> you, then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> and you <b>are</b> you. But if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>because</b> you <b>are</b> {{you and you}} <b>are</b> you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>I</b> and you <b>are</b> not you!" ...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} there were few Jews in the NYPD, and as of 1950 there were none above the rank of captain. Seedman {{recalled}} later in his life {{that there was some}} attendant bias. [...] "I didn't get the choice assignments", he said. [...] "I think it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Jewish." [...] But he persevered, rising through the ranks nevertheless and became a detective. He also earned graduate degrees in public administration during this time.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 30, Akram was {{diagnosed}} with diabetes. [...] "I remember what a shock it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a healthy sportsman with no history of diabetes in my family, so I didn't expect it at all. It seemed strange that {{it happened to me}} when I was 30, but it was a very stressful time and doctors said that can trigger it." [...] Since then he has actively sought to be involved in various awareness campaigns for diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} McAvennie's {{success on the}} pitch came to the {{attention}} of TV producers. He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying [...] "Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who was I to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a footballer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I do," [...] he admitted. [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more {{concerned}} {{to think of}} Dick and Terence and yourself. Sit down, Una." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Grace," [...] he declared, [...] "you spoil me. Perhaps it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going away. Every one is kind to {{the people}} who go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am always}} busy," [...] she answered. [...] "Perhaps it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so lazy. <b>I</b> never do anything, {{so there is}} always so much to do." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make the leap from film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a concert}} in October 2002, at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, someone in the {{audience}} yelled out a request for [...] "Summer of '69," [...] a hit by the similarly-named Bryan Adams. Ryan reacted with a stream of expletives, and ordered the house lights turned on, The Tennessean newspaper reported. He eventually found the fan who made the joke request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, {{and said he would}} not play another note until he had left. In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience member was asked to leave [...] "for screaming a Bryan Adams song", but rather because the man was drunk: [...] "The reason why the guy ever was asked to leave by me <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing an a capella three-piece with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, and myself of ‘Bartering Lines,’ and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming." [...] In April 2015, Ryan, who had since become friends with Bryan, played [...] "Summer of '69" [...] at the end of another performance at the Ryman, an act described by Rolling Stone as [...] "an olive branch to the city that was once his home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alvarez put his finely-shaped hand on Adam's arm. [...] "My friend, {{if it is}} possible, {{you will}} be paid. If not, it will <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I think <b>I</b> know. It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Leslie Gray's daughter, isn't it? I {{know that}} father loved you--his brother, Uncle Willis, {{told me all}} about it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{did write}} you a letter,' she admitted, with misgiving, now {{beginning}} to see her mistake. 'It <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry I had blamed you.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a lady's man," [...] he said carelessly, [...] "but I {{must admit that}} all girls' voices sound pretty much alike to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{forget you}} {{wrote to me}} as one person," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "So <b>I</b> did. That <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the chemist; and I must ask you, Thomas, for your certificate." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went on with}} my hair now, quite comfortably. I sobbed {{a little}} still, but that <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> crying, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crying then.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Bob, I {{was away}} {{one day last}} week. Well, I didn't tell you at the time where I <b>was,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ordered not to; but your uncle said to me, the evening before: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he is right. Oh! I {{know that}} he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{concerned}} in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} such a fool as to faint before," [...] she told Frank afterwards. [...] "I never counted on fainting. If a girl faints, of course she loses all her chance. It <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill. But poor Mr. Moss had the worst of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so {{wise and}} prudent. If {{you were to}} attempt to sell the {{diamonds}} they would stop you, and would not give you credit for the generous purpose afterwards." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} true," [...] I admitted, [...] "but I {{scarcely}} {{see that there}} was anything impertinent in that. Afterwards we spoke together for a little time.
