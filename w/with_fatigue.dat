5|$|A cold usually begins <b>with</b> <b>fatigue,</b> {{a feeling}} of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

5|$|Madhavan has {{appeared}} as host for television programmes on Hindi channels, {{while he has}} also been a host at film award functions. During his television career in the 1990s, Madhavan first worked as a host on Tol Mol Ke Bol. He was announced as the host of Sony Entertainment Television's Deal Ya No Deal, the Indian version of the American game show Deal Or No Deal, in October 2005. However, Madhavan quit as the lead anchor of the show in January 2006 claiming he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had {{made it clear that he}} would continue with his South Indian film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. Madhavan added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him <b>with</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Mandira Bedi subsequently replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show. In June 2010, Madhavan made a comeback to the game show format by accepting a contract with Imagine TV's Big Money show, signing on to host a single season, and then hosted an episode of the crime show Savdhaan India in January 2016. Furthermore, he has been a guest judge in the Indian television show, Fame Gurukul. In 2016, Madhavan stated that he would only take part in television commitments for money, while he does not consider his payment when signing on to appear in films. Madhavan has also hosted live events, notably the National Film Awards in 2013 with Huma Qureshi.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{difference}} between patients with normal and patients <b>with</b> abnormal <b>fatigue</b> on aspects of health status, and investigate the natural course of <b>fatigue</b> in patients <b>with</b> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). METHODS: Fatigue, physiological functioning, functional impairment, symptoms, and Quality of Life (QoL) were measured in 168 patients with COPD, and longitudinal data on fatigue of 77 patients were collected. RESULTS: Fifty percent of patients had abnormal <b>fatigue.</b> Patients <b>with</b> abnormal <b>fatigue</b> reported significantly more problems on the sub-domains of functional impairment (except actual physical activity), symptoms, and QoL as compared to patients <b>with</b> normal <b>fatigue.</b> <b>With</b> respect to physiological functioning patients <b>with</b> normal <b>fatigue</b> scores had better exercise capacity. Four years later the percentage of patients <b>with</b> abnormal <b>fatigue</b> was increased to 64 %. In 1 / 3 of the patients an increase of more than the minimal clinically important difference was found. CONCLUSION: Many COPD patients suffer from abnormal <b>fatigue.</b> Patients <b>with</b> abnormal <b>fatigue</b> have more limitations on many aspects of health status, especially on symptoms, functional impairment, and QoL.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} dynamic {{function}} of hypothalamic 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptors in patients <b>with</b> postviral <b>fatigue</b> syndrome. DESIGN [...] Prospective comparison of patients <b>with</b> postviral <b>fatigue</b> syndrome <b>with</b> two control groups. SETTING [...] Department of neurology, University of Glasgow, Southern General Hospital; department of psychiatry, St James's Hospital, Dublin. SUBJECTS [...] 15 patients <b>with</b> postviral <b>fatigue</b> syndrome, 13 {{age and sex}} matched healthy subjects, and 13 patients with primary depression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Serum prolactin concentrations before and one, two, and three hours after administration of buspirone. RESULTS [...] Because {{of the effects of}} sex hormones on prolactin secretion data for men and women were analysed separately. There {{was no significant difference in}} baseline prolactin concentrations between patients <b>with</b> postviral <b>fatigue</b> syndrome and healthy subjects or those with primary depression. However, the percentage difference between peak and baseline values was significantly higher in patients <b>with</b> postviral <b>fatigue</b> syndrome than the control groups (one way analysis of variance: women, p = 0. 003; men, p = 0. 004).

25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems <b>with</b> <b>fatigue</b> cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme Structural loads, resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue occurs {{frequently}} {{in patients with}} cancer, neurological diseases and chronic inflammatory diseases, but the biological mechanisms that lead to and regulate fatigue are largely unknown. When the innate immune system is activated, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are produced to protect cells. Some extracellular HSPs appear to recognize cellular targets in the brain, and we hypothesize that fatigue may be generated by specific HSPs signalling through neuronal or glial cells in the central nervous system. From a cohort of patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome, 20 patients with high and 20 patients <b>with</b> low <b>fatigue</b> were selected. <b>Fatigue</b> was evaluated <b>with</b> a <b>fatigue</b> visual analogue scale.

Furthermore, we sought to identify what types of barriers interfered with healthcare utilization and why they occurred. MethodsIn a cross-sectional population-based survey, 780 subjects, 112 of them <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome (CFS), completed a healthcare utilization questionnaire. Text analysis was used to create the emerging themes from verbatim responses regarding barriers to healthcare utilization. Multiple logistic regression was performed to examine the association between barriers to healthcare utilization and other factors. ResultsForty percent of subjects reported at least one barrier to healthcare utilization. Of 112 subjects with CFS, 55 % reported at least one barrier to healthcare utilization. Fatiguing status, reported duration of fatigue, insurance, and BMI were significant risk factors for barriers to healthcare utilization. After adjusting for socio-demographics, medication use, the number of health problems, and frequency of healthcare utilization, fatiguing status remained significantly associated with barriers to healthcare utilization. Subjects with CFS were nearly 4 times more likely to forego needed healthcare during the preceding year than non-fatigued subjects while those <b>with</b> insufficient <b>fatigue</b> (ISF) were nearly 3 times more likely. ConclusionBarriers to healthcare utilization pose a significant problem in persons <b>with</b> <b>fatiguing</b> illnesses.

Those meeting the 1994 chronic fatigue syndrome case definition, as determined {{on the basis of their}} telephone responses, were invited for clinical evaluation to confirm a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. For this analysis, we evaluated unemployment due to fatigue, number of hours per week spent on work, chores, and other activities (currently and prior to the onset of fatigue), and energy level.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> {{syndrome}} {{complain of}} physical and mental fatigue that is worsened by exertion. It was predicted that the cognitive and motor responses to vigorous exercise in patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome would differ from those in depressed and healthy controls.  METHODS—Ten patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome, 10 <b>with</b> depressive illness, and 10 healthy controls completed cognitive and muscle strength testing before and after a treadmill exercise test. Measures of cardiovascular functioning and perceived effort, fatigue, and mood were taken during each stage of testing.  RESULTS—Depressed patients performed worst on cognitive tests at baseline. During the treadmill test, patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome had higher ratings of perceived effort and fatigue than both control groups, whereas patients with depression reported lower mood. After exertion, patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome showed a greater decrease than healthy controls on everyday tests of focused (p= 0. 02) and sustained (p= 0. 001) attention, as well as greater deterioration than depressed patients on the focused attention task (p= 0. 03). No between group {{differences were found in}} cardiovascular or symptom measures taken during the cognitive testing.  CONCLUSIONS—Patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome show a specific sensitivity to the effects of exertion on effortful cognitive functioning. This occurs despite subjective and objective evidence of effort allocation in chronic fatigue syndrome, suggesting that patients have reduced working memory capacity, or a greater demand to monitor cognitive processes, or both. Further insight into the pathophysiology of the core complaints in chronic fatigue syndrome is likely to be realised by studying the effects of exercise on other aspects of everyday functioning. ...|$|R
