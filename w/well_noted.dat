5|$|The DWS has functioned {{successfully}} {{since its}} initial operation in 2007. The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Xinshi Tainan (台南新市) and six trains were {{stopped on the}} track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was <b>well</b> <b>noted,</b> and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global railway industry.|$|E
25|$|The Paramount Arts Center, an Art Deco style {{movie theater}} built in 1930, {{is located on}} Winchester Avenue. The {{converted}} theater serves as an important venue {{for the arts in}} eastern Kentucky and the neighboring sections of Ohio and West Virginia. It is <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> for its Festival of Trees event during the winter season. The Paramount is also devoted to teaching children the importance of the arts. Summer classes are offered for school-age children.|$|E
25|$|Mizraab is <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> {{for being}} one of the early {{progenitors}} of the progressive metal genre in Pakistan. The founder, vocalist, lead guitarist and songwriter, Faraz Anwar has strong influences from bands such as Rush, America, Iron Maiden, Kansas and Dio. The band sound is aimed to combine distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music is focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. Mizraab's music has also been compared by some critics with the likes of Dream Theater.|$|E

Wells showed that the US money supply actually grew over the period of the deflation. <b>Wells</b> <b>noted</b> that deflation lowered the cost of only goods that benefited from improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by craftsmen and many services did not decrease in value, and the cost of labor actually increased. [...] Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did not have modern manufacturing, transportation, and communications.|$|R
25|$|The {{autochthonous}} Vlachian {{theory was}} proposed by Bogumil Hrabak (1956) and Marian Wenzel (1962), {{and more recently}} {{was supported by the}} archeological and anthropological researches of skeleton remains from the graves under stećci. However, the theory is much older and was first proposed by Arthur Evans in his work Antiquarian Researches in Illyricum (1883). While doing research with Felix von Luschan on stećak graves around Konavle found out {{that a large number of}} skulls weren't of Slavic origin yet similar to older Illyrian and Arbanasi tribes, as <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> that Dubrovnik memorials recorded those parts to be inhabited by the Vlachs until the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|The band is <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> {{for being}} one of the early {{progenitors}} of the progressive metal genre. The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as Rush, Yes, and Pink Floyd, heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, various speed metal bands, and even the glam metal of the day. This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band's music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots.|$|E
25|$|Basketball {{and golf}} were covered {{to a much}} lesser extent, but they did receive mention due to the show's strong {{relationship}} with Jim Nantz, an acclaimed golf and college basketball broadcaster, plus a few noted college coaches and NBA coaches, reporters, and broadcasters. It is <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> that Russo is {{a big fan of}} tennis; and tennis did get some play on their show (much to Francesa's chagrin) generally leading into and then during the four majors. Francesa is an admirer of horse racing, and the program devoted time to racing talk during the Triple Crown season, the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York, and the Breeders' Cup.|$|E

25|$|Kathmandu is {{a center}} for art in Nepal, {{displaying}} the work of contemporary artists {{in the country and}} also collections of historical artists. Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet, closely linked to the country's religious history {{and on the other hand}} the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> for. Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.|$|E
25|$|His {{method of}} work {{typically}} entailed careful {{preparation for the}} shoot, with the lighting and studio props (of which he used many) arranged in advance. His instructions to models are remembered as being brief and to the point. His published work uses lighting {{to pick out the}} subject; he frequently used four spotlights, often one of them pointing down from the ceiling. Only rarely do his photos include shadows falling on the background of the set. Horst rarely, if ever, used filters. While most of his work is in black & white, much of his color photography includes largely monochromatic settings to set off a colorful fashion. Horst's color photography did include documentation of society interior design, <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> in the volume Horst Interiors. He photographed a number of interiors designed by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade of Denning & Fourcade and often visited their homes on Manhattan and Long Island. After making the photograph, Horst generally left it up to others to develop, print, crop, and edit his work.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> for its unity, as he {{has brought}} a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you come to understand the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the mid-late 1980s, {{the rise}} of the {{so-called}} Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers brought increased popularity of Chinese cinema abroad. Most of the filmmakers who made up the Fifth Generation had graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982 and included Zhang Yimou, Tian Zhuangzhuang, Chen Kaige, Zhang Junzhao and others. These graduates constituted the first group of filmmakers to graduate since the Cultural Revolution and they soon jettisoned traditional methods of storytelling and opted for a more free and unorthodox approach. After the so-called scar literature in fiction had paved the way for frank discussion, Zhang Junzhao's One and Eight (1983) and Chen Kaige's Yellow Earth (1984) in particular were taken to mark the beginnings of the Fifth Generation. The most famous of the Fifth Generation directors, Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, went on to produce celebrated works such as King of the Children (1987), Ju Dou (1989), Farewell My Concubine (1993) and Raise the Red Lantern (1991), which were not only acclaimed by Chinese cinema-goers but by the Western arthouse audience. Tian Zhuangzhuang's films, though less well known by Western viewers, were <b>well</b> <b>noted</b> by directors such as Martin Scorsese. It was during this period that Chinese cinema began reaping the rewards of international attention, including the 1988 Golden Bear for Red Sorghum, the 1992 Golden Lion for The Story of Qiu Ju, the 1993 Palme d'Or for Farewell My Concubine, and three Best Foreign Language Film nominations from the Academy Awards. All these award-winning films starred actress Gong Li, who became the Fifth Generation's most recognizable star, especially to international audiences.|$|E

There is a spoil heap-like feature immediately west of the castle, consisting of pieces of sandstone. This may have been a by-product from the construction of the castle. Today, nothing remains of Buckton Castle above ground and until the late 20th century the overgrowth disguised the fact that it was a stone structure.|$|E
