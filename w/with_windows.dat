5|$|BitLocker {{is a full}} disk {{encryption}} feature included <b>with</b> <b>Windows</b> Vista and later. It {{is designed}} to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default it uses the AES encryption algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. CBC is not used over the whole disk; it is applied to each individual sector.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{graphical}} BitLocker interface in Windows Vista {{could only}} encrypt {{the operating system}} volume. Starting <b>with</b> <b>Windows</b> Vista with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008, volumes other than the operating system volume could be encrypted using the graphical tool. Still, {{some aspects of the}} BitLocker (such as turning autolocking on or off) had to be managed through a command-line tool called manage-bde.wsf.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) systems {{the reduction of}} out-of-band radiations is an essential topic. To design a successful OFDM based overlay systems, {{it is important to}} reduce the sidelobes in OFDM systems. In this paper we consider three approaches: Subcarrier weighting (SW) which is based on the multiplication of the used subcarriers with real-valued weighting factors, second approach we consider is multiple choice sequence (MCS) which is based on producing set of sequences and selecting the one sequence which has lowest power in sidelobes and third approach we consider is the conventional windowing of OFDM signal in time domain. We combine MCS <b>with</b> <b>windowing</b> technique and SW <b>with</b> <b>windowing</b> technique. Simulation results show that by combining MCS <b>with</b> <b>windowing</b> technique and SW <b>with</b> <b>windowing</b> technique, the out-of-band radiations in OFDM system can be significantly suppressed.

5|$|Starting <b>with</b> <b>Windows</b> Server 2012 and Windows 8, Microsoft has complemented BitLocker {{with the}} Microsoft Encrypted Hard Drive specification, {{which allows the}} {{cryptographic}} operations of BitLocker encryption to be offloaded to the storage device's hardware. In addition, BitLocker can now be managed through Windows PowerShell. Finally, Windows 8 introduced Windows To Go in its Enterprise edition, which BitLocker can protect.|$|E
5|$|Steve Kleynhans from Gartner urged {{enterprises}} {{to avoid}} migrating to Windows 8.1.

Furthermore, he recommended to downgrade devices installed <b>with</b> <b>Windows</b> 8.1 to Windows 7 until Windows 10 is available.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires (AoE) is a history-based {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Ensemble Studios {{and published by}} Microsoft, and the first game in the Age of Empires series. The game uses the Genie, a 2D sprite-based game engine. The game allows the user to act {{as the leader of}} an ancient civilization by advancing it through four ages (the Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron Ages), gaining access to new and improved units with each advance. It was later ported to Pocket PCs <b>with</b> <b>Windows,</b> resulting in a version very similar to the PC game.|$|E
5|$|As part of Microsoft's {{unification}} strategies, Windows {{products that}} are based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as Windows 10 Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems, along <b>with</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 IoT Core, which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar to Windows Embedded.|$|E

A supported infrared-illuminated camera is required for Windows Hello face authentication. Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third-party certificates loaded, and CPU virtualization extensions (including SLAT and IOMMU) enabled in firmware.|$|E
