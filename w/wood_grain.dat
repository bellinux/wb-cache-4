5|$|Prodigy: Building onto {{what the}} AT-X offers, the semi-luxury Prodigy, branded the Touring in New Zealand and the Middle East, {{features}} an electrically adjustable driver's seat, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, parking sensors, <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> interior and full leather upholstery. The Prodigy also sees a chrome grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels along with {{front fog lamps}} as standard.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for use when towing a boat or trailer for example.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E

25|$|Wooden {{movable type}} was also first {{developed}} around 1040 AD by Bi Sheng (990–1051), {{as described by}} the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due {{to the presence of}} <b>wood</b> <b>grains</b> and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.|$|R
25|$|The 1969 {{model year}} brought few modifications. Exterior changes {{included}} a new grille with a center divider and new longitudinal taillights, both designed by Harvey J. Winn. A new trim line called the Special Edition (SE) was added. This could be available by itself or {{together with the}} R/T, thus making an R/T-SE. The SE added leather inserts to the front seats only, chrome rocker moldings, a <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> steering wheel, and <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> inserts on the instrument panel. A sunroof {{was added to the}} option list, but was ordered on only 260 Chargers. The bumble bee stripes returned as well, but were changed slightly. Instead of four stripes, it now consisted of a wide stripe framed by two smaller stripes. In the middle of the stripe, an R/T cutout was placed. If the stripe was deleted, a metal R/T emblem was placed where the R/T cutout was. Total production was around 89,199 units.|$|E
25|$|Inside were revised {{interiors}} {{featuring a}} two-spoke cushioned {{steering wheel and}} new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer and instrument placement similar to previous full-sized Chevrolets. Caprices continued with higher grade interiors than their Impala counterparts with luxurious cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> trim on dash, steering wheel and door panels plus carpeting on lower door panels on both sedans and coupes. A center front seat armrest was also featured on sedans.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} <b>wood</b> <b>grain.</b> Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E

25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> trim from floor to ceiling, with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the <b>wood</b> <b>grain.</b> They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of the Campbell House photo album allowed for accurate restoration of the interior rooms. Using the photographs, the first room to be restored was the morning room beginning in 1980. During the mid-1980s the dining room was partially restored. False <b>wood</b> <b>graining</b> was restored or recreated in both rooms. In the morning room, wallpaper was recreated to match the pattern in the photos. In the dining room, the elaborate painted ceiling was recreated.|$|R

The audio player display takes the same design as the 2009 Hyundai Sonata, and the controls for the audio player have been redesigned. An auxiliary input jack and iPod integration system is now standard, though deleted {{in the case}} of the LG Navigation system on the Limited trim level. A wood-trimmed steering wheel is once again standard for the Limited, and Limited models receive special hyper-silver finished alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|From October 1995, the V6 {{models were}} simply {{known as the}} Vienta—losing the Camry {{identity}} altogether. The availability of manual transmission on the CSi and Touring Series V6 sedan variants coincided with the update, while the V6 Grande superseded the V6 Ultima. Perforated leather upholstery and <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> trim on the Grande was optional. Towards {{the end of the}} model run, special edition Getaway (October 1996) and Intrigue (April 1997) sedan models were launched. Based on the CSi, the Getaway was further equipped with 14-inch alloy wheels, a CD player and air conditioning. Also based on the CSi, the Intrigue added air conditioning, CD player, Jacquard upholstery, extra seat-back map pockets, and 15-inch wheels. Toyota fitted the four-cylinder Intrigue with the same wheel covers as the Vienta CSi, with the Vienta Intrigue upgraded to alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|Between 1915 and 1917 {{approximately}} 300,000 M1895's were manufactured for {{the army}} of the Russian Empire, accounting for about 70% of total production of the rifles prior to 1936 when the M1895 was discontinued. Chambered in 7.62×54mmR, these versions were unusual for a lever-action rifle in that they also had a charger guide, allowing the M1895 rifle to be reloaded by the same charger clips used in the Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifle. Rifles made for the Russian contract had a longer than standard barrel fitted with an extended forestock and bayonet lug. Initial delivery of the rifles was delayed because adaptation to Russian standards, particularly the charger guide, proved more difficult than expected. Additional delays resulted from incompetent and obstructive Russian inspectors, who refused to use Winchester-made test gauges despite no Russian gauges existing, insisted that test ammunition be shipped from Russia (instead of using readily available Winchester ammunition made on Russian contract), and often rejected rifles for irrelevant flaws such as <b>wood</b> <b>grain</b> in the stock being insufficiently straight. Winchester later sold these rejected rifles on the US commercial market. Russia issued many of their Winchester Model 1895 rifles to troops from Finland and the Baltic states, especially the Latvian Riflemen. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the Soviet Union in 1936 to the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
