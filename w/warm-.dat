5|$|The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters {{are thought}} to have {{migrated}} to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a <b>warm-</b> or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the rate of {{temperature}} change with increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is amplified at high latitudes, but there is growing evidence that the rate of <b>warm-ing</b> is also amplified with elevation, such as in mountain environ-ments. This elevation-dependent warming (EDW) has important implications for the mass balance of the high-altitude cryosphere and associated runoff; for ecosystems and farming communities in high-mountain environments; and also for species that reside in restricted altitudinal zones within a mountain range. However, because of sparse high-elevation observations, there is a danger that we may not be monitoring some regions of the globe that are <b>warm-ing</b> the most. Here we review the evidence for EDW and examine the mechanisms that may account for this phenomenon. We conclude with a strategy for future research to reduce current uncertainties and to ensure that the changes taking place in remote high-elevation regions of the planet are adequately observed and accounted for.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, we show {{evidence}} of sig-nificant stratospheric warming over Southern Hemisphere high latitudes and {{large portions of}} the Antarctic polar re-gion in winter and spring seasons, with a maximum <b>warm-ing</b> of 7 – 8 ◦C in September and October, using satellite Mi-crowave Sounding Unit observations for 1979 – 2006. It is found that this warming is associated with increasing wave activity from the troposphere into the stratosphere, suggest-ing that the warming is caused by enhanced wave-driven adiabatic heating. We show that the stratospheric <b>warm-ing</b> in Southern Hemisphere high latitudes has close corre-lations with sea surface temperature (SST) increases, and that general circulation model simulations forced with ob-served time-varying SSTs reproduce similar warming trend patterns in the Antarctic stratosphere. The simulated strato-spheric warming {{is closely related to}} increasing wave activ-ity in the Southern Hemisphere. These findings suggest that the stratospheric warming is likely induced by SST warming. As SST warming continues as a consequence of greenhouse gas increases due to anthropogenic activity, the stratospheric warming would also continue, which has important implica-tions to the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Roots are key {{components}} of C cycling in terres-trial ecosystems and {{play an important role}} in the regulation of response of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate <b>warm-ing,</b> which is predicted to occur with greater warming mag-nitudes at night than during daytime across different regions on the Earth. However, there has been no detailed study to investigate the effect of asymmetrical warming on root dy-namics at the level of terrestrial ecosystems. To understand the effects of day and night warming on root lifespan in the semiarid temperate steppe in northern China, a field study with a full factorial design including control, day warming, night warming and continuous warming was conducted using modified rhizotron technique during three growing seasons in 2007 – 2009. Our results show that day, night and continu-ous warming had different effects on longevity of roots born in spring, summer and autumn, and that day warming sig-nificantly prolonged overall lifespan for the roots born in the three growing seasons, while night warning had no effect on overall lifespan. Day and night warming had different ef-fects on root non-structural carbohydrate content, suggesting that allocation of photoassimilate may account for the dif-ferential responses of root lifespan to day and night <b>warm-ing.</b> These results differ from other processes associated with ecosystems C cycle such as total ecosystem produc-tivity, net ecosystem productivity and soil respiration. Our findings highlight that it is essential to incorporate the dif-ferential effects of day and night warming on root dynamics into simulating and predicting the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems C cycling to global warming. ...|$|R
