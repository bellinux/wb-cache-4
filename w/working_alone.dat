5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was {{suspended}} in June 1831 before {{the building has}} risen from its foundations. This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> {{may not have been}} an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{when she}} was {{finishing}} writing up her thesis, she was the youngest and last of Mulliken's pre-war students, and was <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> because all her fellow students had become involved with war work. She met Herbert Anderson, who was working for Enrico Fermi. The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, {{and as soon as}} her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully, <b>working</b> <b>alone,</b> pursues a cult that worship a slug-like organism and {{believe it to be}} the Second Coming of Jesus Christ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head.|$|E

5|$|At Imageworks, as per Leon, he {{was asked}} to develop an {{improved}} digital film review software as an alternative to a then existing software. Leon released the initial version within two months of having been assigned the job; after receiving positive feedback from the artists using the software, Leon kept updating various functionalities of the software over the years. This digital 3D film review software, itView, led Leon to get an Academy Award in 2016. Leon mentions <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> on the project for many years, and that he was over time given a team when the project achieved significant growth. In a 2016 media interview, Leon says that he worked on the itView technology for eight years as the chief contributor.|$|E
5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|After the Báb was {{executed}} in 1850, {{a group of}} Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah Nasser-al-Din Shah, {{in retaliation for the}} Báb's execution. Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan; however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished in June 1851 when he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's request, returning only after Amir Kabir's fall from power. On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were <b>working</b> <b>alone,</b> the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the Bábí community that were encouraged and orchestrated by the government. During this time many Bábís were killed, and many more, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál ("black pit"), an underground dungeon of Tehran.|$|E

From a village with 200 <b>working</b> stone-cutters <b>alone,</b> Furnace in 2008 has a total population of little over 200, many retired or semi-retired. A significant source of work is fish farming, but this employs fewer people than locals had initially hoped.|$|R

As a screenwriter, his best-known films are The Man in the White Suit (for which he received a 1952 Academy Award nomination) and The Mouse That Roared. He was a cousin of Alexander Mackendrick.|$|R
5|$|PFC Guy Gabaldon (1926–2006) went to {{live with}} the parents of his Japanese-American friend at the age of 12. At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, his adoptive family was placed in a relocation camp. Gabaldon joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded in not only obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians to surrender. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star instead. His medal was later upgraded to the Navy Cross. He turned in more enemy soldiers than Sergeant Alvin York, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers. Gabaldon's actions on Saipan were later memorialized in the film Hell to Eternity, in which he was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Hunter.|$|E
5|$|Rudy's {{attraction}} to the veterinarian's wife leads to them having consensual sex {{in front of her}} husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in a motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E
5|$|True Detective was {{intended}} to be a novel, but once the project took definite form, Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of Galveston, and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the True Detective pilot script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter. He wrote a second True Detective script soon after his departure from The Killing thanks to the support of production company and manager Anonymous Content, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of True Detective. Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.|$|E
50|$|Dalton {{suggested}} that {{everything in the}} universe was made of atoms, {{and that there are}} as many kinds of atoms as there are elements, each one with its own signature weight. Based on these ideas, <b>working</b> completely <b>alone,</b> Dalton attempted to impose some order on the elements by drawing up a list, where each element was represented by an alchemical-looking symbol, ordered by atomic weight.|$|R

50|$|Lenin, {{in light}} of the Marx's theory of the state (which views the state as an oppressive organ of the ruling class), had no qualms of forcing change upon the country. He viewed the {{dictatorship}} of the proletariat, in contrast to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, as the dictatorship of the majority. The repressive powers of the state were to be used to transform the country, and to strip of the former ruling class of their wealth. Lenin believed that the transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production would last for a long period. According to some authors, Leninism was by definition authoritarian. In contrast to Karl Marx, who believed that the socialist revolution would be composed of and led by the <b>working</b> class <b>alone,</b> Lenin argued that a socialist revolution did not necessarily need to be led by or composed of the <b>working</b> class <b>alone,</b> instead contending that a revolution needed to be led by the oppressed classes of society, which in the case of Russia was the peasant class.|$|R
25|$|In February 2013, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{warned that}} at least 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure.

25|$|While a few {{writers and}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} assign such a retrospective diagnosis to Turing, {{and it is true}} that he had his share of eccentricities, the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film – social awkwardness, difficulty working cooperatively with others, and tendency to take things too literally – bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing, who, despite enjoying <b>working</b> <b>alone,</b> was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.|$|E
50|$|Each {{production}} in the series focuses {{on the work of}} one individual composer, <b>working</b> either <b>alone</b> or with a lyricist (or lyricists) by creating songs for the stage, screen, radio, or television. Composers saluted in the series so far include Milton Ager, Harold Arlen, Nacio Herb Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Sammy Fain, Ray Henderson, Victor Herbert, James V. Monaco, Richard Rodgers (who required three separate shows to include his vast catalogue), Jule Styne, and Harry Warren.|$|R

50|$|The {{collaboration}} between the artists lasted {{only a few years}} with Henderson <b>working</b> on designs <b>alone</b> until 1962. The artists continued to receive royalties on their design work from Cole & Son and Hull Traders until the company was dissolved in 1975.|$|R
25|$|After 7 days of loading, the {{crankshaft}} of {{the compressor}} broke, damaging the machine's casing and causing {{the loss of}} the 643 sheep stowed. It took a month for a local machinist to rebuild the crankshaft and associated machinery. The frozen carcasses were resold locally during this time, and, encouragingly, they were considered to be indistinguishable from fresh meat. On 15 February 1882, the Dunedin sailed with 4331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 250 kegs of butter, hare, pheasant, turkey, chicken and 2226 sheep tongues. Sparks from the compressor's boiler created a fire hazard, and Captain Whitson at one point developed hypothermia while <b>working</b> <b>alone</b> in the air duct.|$|E
25|$|By May 2011, {{the police}} had put up wanted posters seeking {{information}} about Jaishankar, in public places across Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

25|$|In 1852, {{two years}} after the {{execution}} of the Báb, a fringe element in the Bábí community made an unskilled plot against the Shah, Nasser-al-Din Shah, in retaliation for the Báb's execution. While Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan strongly, and renounced the movement's early anti-Qajar stance, on August 15, 1852 the radicalized Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were <b>working</b> <b>alone,</b> and that Bahá'u'lláh had not participated in the assassination attempt, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed. From that time Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar always remained suspicious of the Bábís and Baha'is and viewed them as agitators similar to the European anarchists.|$|E
