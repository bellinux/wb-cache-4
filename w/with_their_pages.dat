6000|$|And here {{it would}} be easy to {{describe}} the company which arrived, and make display of antiquarian lore. Now we would represent a cavalcade of knights arriving, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>pages</b> carrying their shining helms of gold, and the stout esquires, bearers of lance and banner. Anon would arrive a fat abbot on his ambling pad, surrounded by the white-robed companions of his convent. Here should come the gleemen and jonglers, the minstrels, the mountebanks, the party-colored gipsies, the dark-eyed, nut-brown Zigeunerinnen; then a troop of peasants chanting Rhine-songs, and leading in their ox-drawn carts the peach-cheeked girls from the vine-lands. Next we would depict the litters blazoned with armorial bearings, from between the broidered curtains of which peeped out the swan-like necks and the haughty faces of the blond ladies of the castles. But for these descriptions we have not space; and the reader is referred to the account of the tournament in the ingenious novel of [...] "Ivanhoe," [...] where the above phenomena are described at length. Suffice it to say, that Otto and his companions arrived at the town of Cleves, and, hastening to a hostel, reposed themselves after the day's march, and prepared them for the encounter of the morrow.|$|E

40|$|Nearly {{two and a}} half centuries {{have passed}} since the first British Gothic novels began to attract {{attention}} <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>pages</b> full of monstrous characters, excessive violence, explicit sexual content and all kinds of horrific scenes. For the most part, the reception of this type of literature has been very positive, though not exempt from controversies. This paper seeks to show how, beyond the alluring mystery, inventive plots and attraction of the dark side, British horror fiction appeals to the reader’s inner desires and imagination by means of transgressive political, religious or sexual contents that often defy taboos and social decorum. To illustrate this argument, three well-known authors and texts from three different periods will be discussed: Matthew Gregory Lewis’s The Monk (1796), Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu’s “Carmilla” (1872) and Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange (1962) ...|$|E

40|$|These {{works were}} made to mark the Tercentenary {{of the birth of}} Samuel Johnson, and in {{response}} to the house where he compiled one of the first English Dictionaries. Samuel Johnson, 1709 - 1784, was hard on books, capable of tearing the heart out of them and leaving them – as if discarded – on table or floor as soon as they had served his immediate purpose. But these specimens, <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>pages</b> precisely laser-cut, are clearly not the result of careless treatment. Prophet is interested in the way familiar objects can be adopted as symbols, for example, the use of the oak tree as shorthand for Englishness. With these works she has transformed standard dictionaries by designing computer fonts to facilitate the laser cutting of shapes, of words and objects that evoke ideas of Johnson’s life and work. Collectively the books symbolize his achievements as the leading literary figure of his time and the incisive intelligence he brought to his undertakings as a poet, biographer, lexicographer, essayist, editor and reviewer. A commemorative Jasperware medallion of Johnson was issued by Wedgwood in 1784 and is thought to have been modeled by the celebrated sculptor John Flaxman shortly before Johnson’s death the same year. Jane Prophet’s Portrait of Samuel Johnson, a dictionary in which a profile of Samuel Johnson is cut through the pages (produced in an edition of 10) offers a comparable, though perhaps more apposite, memento...|$|E
