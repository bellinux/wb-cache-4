COSTFORD strongly believes in preservation of the environmental resources and promotes the use of energy-efficient materials and which minimize the use of energy-intensive materials such as cement, steel, and glass. They use fired bricks or mud blocks stabilized with lime and rice husks for masonry. They also experiment with renewable building materials such as bamboo, which they use as reinforcement for the foundations with lime concrete or for slabs where they use bamboo as an exposed form with concrete on top.|$|R

The experimental load-displacement curves and observation of the crushed sections of filled tubes have shown that partial foam filling reduced the fold length and hence increased the average crushing loads of tubes, proving the interaction effect between tube <b>wall</b> and <b>filler.</b> The interaction coefficients for the partial foam filling were further calculated {{to be in the}} level and/or higher than that of the foam plateau load of transverse direction...|$|R
50|$|Urea-formaldehyde foam {{insulation}} (UFFI) was used {{extensively in the}} 1970s. Homeowners used UFFI as a <b>wall</b> cavity <b>filler</b> {{at the time in}} order to conserve energy. In the 1980s, concerns began to develop about formaldehyde vapor emitted in the curing process, {{as well as from the}} breakdown of old foam. Emission rates exceeding 3.0 - 5.0 parts per million (ppm) cause a variety of adverse health effects impacting the eyes, nose, and respiratory system. Consequently, its use was discontinued. The urea-formaldehyde emissions decline over time and significant levels should no longer be present in the homes today. Modern replacement options for UFFI include melamine formaldehyde resin, low-emission UF insulation materials, polycarbonate and polyurethane. The curing temperature is unknown.|$|R

The rib beams and the rib columns can share parts of the vertical and horizontal loads which the structure should bear and work together with the frame beams and the specially shaped columns, so make the lateral stiffness of the structure is increased and the ultimate strength, ductility and seismic performance of the structure are improved. Moreover, Phosphorus gypsum will be poured to enclose concrete beams and columns and become the <b>filler</b> <b>wall</b> among them. At the same time, phosphorus gypsum wallboards are used as the middle <b>filler</b> <b>walls</b> to separated rooms flexibly. By doing so, the building is more energy saving.

Utilizing energy dissipation theory analyzes the building energy consumption. Conclusion: The glass bead thermal insulation concrete frame structure of fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete block <b>filler</b> <b>wall</b> meets the requirement of Sichuan residential building energy-saving code. China is the biggest coal producing and consumptive country. Recently, with the steady development of energy industries, the fly ash produced by coal increased annually, resulting in serious environmental pollution and stress to economics. As the relevant data shown, in 2013, only 3 cities met the tier 2 standard among 74 cities under the air quality monitoring. The disposition and recycle of fly ash have drawn the wide concern of publics. Producing the fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete block opened up a new approach for power plant fly ash. 1 m 3 fly ash NALC can consume 350 kg fly ash; therefore, production of autoclaved aerated concrete block is significant by improving environmental pollution and energy-saving.

Owing to the negative pressure being great at the sealed wall at the end of the retained roadway, the drainage rate and concentration are higher than those at the buried pipes in <b>filler</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
40|$|Addition of low {{amounts of}} {{additives}} {{is necessary to}} guarantee dimensional stability of low-density flexible polyethylene foam after extrusion. It is expected that the additives form a layer on the foam cell walls. However, the physical phenomena responsible for the stability improvement are not well understood. Using low-frequency dielectric spectroscopy, we show the occurrence of interfacial polarization in these low-density polyethylene foams. We hypothesize and prove that a stabilized low-density, closed cell polyethylene foam {{can be regarded as}} a three-phase system with a polyethylene matrix forming the cell <b>walls,</b> a <b>filler</b> being the gas phase, and an intermediate additive layer. At elevated temperatures the additive layer will become conductive resulting in interfacial polarization, thereby excluding the entire filler volume from the electrical field. This is reflected in an increase of the dielectric constant of the foam from initially 1. 0 to about 300 at the melting point of the additive. The frequency-independent position of the peaks suggests that the additive layer is crystalline...|$|R

To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} <b>filler</b> <b>walls</b> on lateral rigidity of steel frame, Some methods such as theoretical analysis, finite elements calculation and experiment study were carried out to do research on the resistant-lateral effectiveness and the steel consumption of the three different structural systems, namely steel frame, frame-bracing and frame-board. The {{results show that the}} frame-board system can improve the structural lateral rigidity effectively, and will enhance the structural fundamental natural frequency sharply as well as reducing the structural steel consumption. It is an effective method for improving structural lateral rigidity to utilize the frame filled with wall panel.

30|$|Usually, the infill {{walls of}} a {{building}} are not considered as elements of the force-resisting system. In many instances, structural walls are assumed to resist racking loads due to wind and earthquake. Such walls are generally known as shear walls and can also carry vertical loads and are designed {{as an integral part}} of the structures. Other types of <b>walls</b> are called <b>filler</b> panels, which are used to partition space or to enclose structures. Such panels occupy a rectangular space between two adjacent columns and two successive stories. But these filler panels can have considerable influences on the lateral response of a building. Nowadays, soft story in buildings is common at the parking level as there is absence of infill walls, whereas the stories above are filled with partition walls. Such frames have less capacity to bear lateral loads. Portal frames tested up to collapse have drawn attention of several investigators in the recent past for inherent structural advantage of such frames.|$|R

Some analytic solution formulas of bending moment about beams acted on symmetric load are deduced. Table of equivalent uniform load coefficient according {{to the principle of}} bending moment equivalency is listed. The feasibility and beware are also discussed. General During {{the process of}} structure design, the situation that a wall with a door or window is common encountered. When we use the software to do design work, such <b>filler</b> <b>wall</b> is considered as load on the beam, shown with Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Since the load is non uniform, the work will be heavy if we input the load as the matter of fact. Usually we input such load as equivalent uniform load, and consider the load as 0. 8 times the load of wall without a door or a window. The accuracy of such method is notable...|$|R
40|$|The Semi Interlocking Masonry (SIM) bricks were {{designed}} and {{developed at the}} Univer- sity of Newcastle as {{a new type of}} energy dissipation device in buildings for use as wall panels in seismic regions. The interlocking features of SIM prevent the relative out-of-plane movement of bricks in the panel; however permit limited longitudinal movement along the bed-joint. Dry stacked SIM wall could have some gaps in both bedding and perpend joints which reduce thermal insulation efficiency. In this study non-adhesive gap-fillers were employed to improve the thermal insulation of SIM walls. The objec- tive {{of this study is to}} examine thermal properties of SIM walls by use of standard testing methodology (ASTM C 1363) and suitability of selected gap fillers for intended application. The results of thermal tests showed that, the thermal properties of SIM <b>walls</b> with gap <b>fillers</b> are equal of normal concrete wall and also, it was concluded that, the type of gap fillers has an insignificant effect on the thermal performance of SIM walls...|$|R
40|$|Steady state {{shear flow}} of wood/high density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) composites is investigated through capillary rheometry to gain better insight into rheology, extrudate distortions and wall slip phenomena of wood/polymer composite melts. Effects of filler content and temperature on onset {{and end of}} stick-slip transition, in terms of shear rate and shear stress, are also studied. Results show that shear rates at stick-slip transition decrease while corresponding shear stresses increase {{with the addition of}} filler. Furthermore, temperature raises the shear rate and the shear stress at which the transition occurs. It is observed a log-linear relationship in the plots of wall slip versus the shear stress, in particular, increasing the filler content and decreasing the temperature, these plots are shifted to higher shear stress, as a consequence of viscosity increment. <b>Wall</b> slip and <b>filler</b> content play a fundamental role in surface morphology; specifically, extrudates become smoother with increasing filler content and shear rate, whose increment always results in a rise of the wall slip...|$|R
40|$|Three {{full scale}} wall {{elements}} were cast {{with three different}} concretes: an unstable SCC, one stabilized by adding filler, and one stabilized by adding chemical stabilizer. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of the stabilization on the rheology of the SCC and on the final surface quality. All delivered SCC's were rather stone rich and unstable, even the stabilized ones. This was most likely caused by a change in the fines and water content of the sand for which the concrete recipe was not corrected. Even though the SCC's were not as expected certain conclusions could be drawn. All three mixes had a low viscosity and relatively high yield stress indicating segregation. The questionable stability was confirmed by the sieve segregation test, but not by the visual segregation index on the flow board. Stability assed on a hardened concrete cylinder indicated good stability for the unstable and filler stabilized SCC. However, the chemically stabilized concrete showed clear signs of bleeding. Regarding the surface quality of the wall elements, it can be concluded that all surfaces had a similar grey level independent of the type of SCC used or whether or not formwork agent was applied. It is not possible to come to clear conclusions as to how the SCC type or the surface treatment affects the amount of pores. However, there is an indication that the chemical stabilizers can lead to large bleeding pores in the lower part of the surface of the concrete <b>wall,</b> whereas <b>filler</b> stabilization can gives rise to the formation of very fine pores. The fact that all SCC's were on the verge of instability, did not allow for clear rheological differences nor clear differences in final surface quality. 3 D 00594...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2003 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 82 - 86) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiv, 86 leavesThe strengthening {{effect of}} foam filling {{and the effect}} of foam filling on the crushing properties of the light weight foam filled circular tubes were investigated through the polystyrene foam filled thin-walled Al tubes of 16 and 25 mm in diameter. The empty tubes crushed progressively in asymmetric (diamond) mode. The foam filling however turned the deformation mode into progressive axisymmetric (concertina) mode in 25 mm Al tube, while the deformation mode in foam filled 16 mm Al tube remained to be the same with that of the empty tube. The strengthening coefficients of foam-filling defined as the ratio between the increase in the average crushing load of the filled tube with respect to empty tube and plateau load (load corresponding to the plateau stress of the foam) were found to be 1. 8 and 3. 2 for the concertina and diamond mode of deformation, respectively. The higher value of strengthening in diamond mode of deformation was attributed to the filler deformation beyond the densification region. This was also confirmed by the microscopic observation of the partially crushed sections of the filled tubes. The interaction effect between tube and filler was assessed by the compression testing of the partially foam filled tubes. The effects of filler density, deformation rate (in the range between 0. 001 - 0. 04 s- 1) and the use of adhesive between the tube <b>wall</b> and <b>filler</b> on the average crushing load, stroke efficiency and specific absorbed energy of the tubes were determined. The specific absorbed energy of the filled tube was compared with that of the empty tubes of wall thickening on the equal mass basis. Finally, two modes of deformation modes were proposed for the crushing behavior of the foam filled thin-walled Al tubes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: On 12 May 2008, {{a violent}} {{earthquake}} with a magnitude of 8. 0 occurred in Wenchuan, Sichuan Province, China. The earthquake {{resulted in a}} large number of collapses and damages of buildings, and brought huge loss to the people’s lives and properties. This paper gathers the building seismic damage data in major disaster area. The data are classified according to structural type, construction time and occupancies. It is learned that the strict implementation of seismic design codes is the prerequisite to guarantee the seismic capacity of building structures. For masonry structures, the design of structural system and earthquake-resistant measures should be emphasized and the construction quality should be ensured. For RC frame structures, the construction measure of the connections between enclosure and <b>filler</b> <b>walls</b> and the main structure should be carefully designed. Measures to ensure the strong column-weak beam damage mode should be revised and improved. Furthermore, methods to increase the integral aseismic capacity of building structures are discussed in the framework of system theory. It is shown that the safety margin of building structural systems can be divided into three levels, say fundamental, integral and unexpected safety margins. The overall seismic capacity and collapse prevention of building structures are mainly determined by the integral safety margin and unexpected safety margin. Lack of unexpected safety margin {{is one of the main}} reasons of the severe building damage in the Sichuan earthquake. The unexpected safety margin of a structural system mainly comes from its robustness, stability and firmness. Researches on the integral and unexpected safety margins of building structures are still very limited. Corresponding requirements and specifications in current design code for building structures are to be improved...|$|R
