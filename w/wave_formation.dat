The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock <b>wave</b> <b>formation.</b> This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

50|$|Sea water wave is {{generated}} by many kinds of disturbances such as Seismic events, gravity, and crossing wind. The generation of wind wave is initiated by the disturbances of cross wind field {{on the surface of}} the sea water. Two major mechanisms of surface <b>wave</b> <b>formation</b> by winds (a.k.a.‘The Miles-Phillips Mechanism’) and other sources (ex. earthquakes) of <b>wave</b> <b>formation</b> can explain the generation of wind waves. However, if one set a flat water surface (Beaufort Point,0) and abrupt cross wind flows {{on the surface of the}} water, then the generation of surface wind waves can be explained by following two mechanisms which are initiated by normal pressure fluctuations of turbulent winds and parallel wind shear flows.|$|E

For {{the most part}} NbSe3 follows this trend except two anomalies exist where {{electrical resistivity}} reaches two local maxima at 145 K and 59 K. The maxima result in a sharp decrease in electrical conductivity. This observation is explained by the charge density wave formations that open the gaps in the Fermi surface. The opening causes the 1-D linear system to behave more like a semiconductor and less like a metal, a transition commonly known as Peierls transition. NbSe3 continues to be metallic despite the Peierls transition because the charge density <b>wave</b> <b>formation</b> does not completely remove the Fermi surface, a phenomenon known as imperfect Fermi surface nesting.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} ENSO-related wind forcing contribution to off-equatorial Rossby <b>wave</b> <b>formations</b> {{in the eastern}} tropical regions of the North and South Pacific using satellite altimeter data and atmospheric reanalysis data {{during the period of}} 1993 – 2013. After mature phases of ENSO events, the sea surface height anomaly fields showed that off-equatorial Rossby waves propagated westward along 11 °N and 8 °S from the eastern Pacific. Starting longitudes of the westward propagation were distant from the eastern coast, especially for weak El Niño events in the 2000 s, in contrast to the strong 1997 / 98 El Niño event in which the propagations started from the coast. Based on observational data, it was hypothesized that the Rossby waves could be formed by off-equatorial zonal belts of wind stress curl anomalies (WSCAs) in 135 °– 90 °W rather than by wave emissions from the eastern coast. A numerical model forced only by WSCAs, that is, without wave emissions from the coast, successfully reproduced observed features of the Rossby waves in 180 °– 120 °W, supporting the study’s hypothesis. During mature phases of El Niño events, equatorially symmetric negative sea level pressure anomalies (SLPAs) resulting from hydrostatic adjustment to the underlying warm sea surface temperature anomalies dominated over the eastern tropical Pacific. Anomalous surface easterlies blowing around the negative SLPA area as geostrophic winds were a major contributor in forming the anticyclonic WSCAs. The polarity of the anomalies is reversed during La Niña events. Therefore, spatial patterns of the SLPAs associated with the ENSO events are necessary to understand the Rossby <b>wave</b> <b>formations...</b>|$|R
