5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children.
