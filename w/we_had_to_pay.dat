500|$|The {{decision}} in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade. [...] According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, [...] "Just to fight the injunction, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{at least half a}} million dollars in legal fees." [...] On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.|$|E
