5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels {{as she made}} for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
5|$|Highbury was {{the venue}} for twelve FA Cup semi-finals as a neutral ground, {{the first in}} 1929 and the last in 1997, {{although}} between 1984 and 1992 it <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> FA's list of approved venues, after Arsenal's refusal to install perimeter fencing following a pitch invasion by Everton fans during their semi-final against Southampton. It also hosted the London XI's home leg against Lausanne Sports in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals; London won 2–0 on the night and 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|While Gloria <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{east coast}} of Florida, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Henry, Virginia, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1000 UTC on September 26, or 19.5 hours before landfall. By later that day, a hurricane watch was issued {{for the rest of}} the eastern United States to Eastport, Maine. By two hours before Gloria's landfall on Long Island, a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area, after warnings were gradually extended further north. Officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than what occurred, due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the ninth inning. While he <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. Levant was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered Levant to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed Levant to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and Levant was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard Levant, with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow his car to be removed from the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's nose cone in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after departing Bodrum, UB-14 {{had just}} cleared the Greek island of Kos and <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> nearby island of Kandeloussa when von Heimburg sighted several {{potential}} victims. The first ship seen was the British hospital ship , headed to Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the properly identified hospital ship, allowed Soudan to pass unmolested. The next ship {{was not so}} lucky, however. It was the unescorted , a Canadian ocean liner pressed into troopship duties. Royal Edward was headed {{in the opposite direction}} from Soudan: from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with reinforcements for the British 29th Infantry and a small group with the Royal Army Medical Corps, all of whom were destined for Gallipoli. Von Heimburg launched one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2km) away and hit Royal Edward in the stern; the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with a large loss of life. Soudan and several other ships were able to rescue nearly 700 men, but over 900 died. Royal Edward, at , was also among the largest ships hit by U-boats during the war. While evading the rescue ships, which included two French destroyers, UB-14s compass broke down again, forcing a return to Bodrum {{on the morning of the}} 15th.|$|E
5|$|When Gravel {{joined the}} Senate in January 1969, he {{requested}} {{and received a}} seat on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, which had direct relevance to Alaskan issues. He also got a spot on the Public Works Committee, which he held throughout his time in the Senate. Finally, {{he was a member of}} the Select Committee on Small Business. In 1971 he became chair of the Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, then by 1973 he was chair of its Subcommittee on Water Resources, then later its Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution. Gravel was also initially named to the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations. By 1973 Gravel <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the Select Small Business Committee and instead a member of the Finance Committee, and by 1977 was chair of that body's Subcommittee on Energy and Foundations. By 1973 he had also been on the ad hoc Special Committee to Study Secret and Confidential Government Documents.|$|E

5|$|With warm {{waters and}} {{favorable}} upper-level conditions, Helinda attained cyclone status on February1, and the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), slightly below its estimate for the cyclone's peak winds in the Australian region. Due to a powerful ridge near Île Amsterdam, Helinda {{turned to the}} southeast on February2, where cooler water temperatures induced weakening. Two days later, strong wind shear contributed to further weakening, and the storm deteriorated to tropical depression status. Turning back to the west, the circulation was declared dissipated by the MFR on February7, although the JTWC continued tracking Helinda until February14 when the system <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> northeast coast of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding <b>was</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that it was because of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen <b>was</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
