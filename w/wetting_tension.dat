Semiquantitative agreement between predicted and experimentally-measured cell adhesion obtained for three different cell types (MDCK, RBL- 1, and HCT- 15) in two different liquid phase compositions of surfactants (Tween- 80 and fetal bovine serum) supports concepts and approximations utilized in development of theory.

The added salt controls the electric double layer formation as well as affects the zeta (ζ) potential at the air-water and solid-water interfaces. The resulting electrostatic <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> acts in conjunction with the air-water surface tension (analogous to electrowetting scenarios), thereby affecting the nanobubble morphologies. Weak ζ potential of the water-HOPG interface or the water-OTS-silicon interface at acidic pH ensures that the added salt will have imperceptible effect on the corresponding preformed surface nanobubbles, validating the experimental observations. However, at alkaline buffer pH for the OTS-silicon substrate, under certain system conditions, salt-induced ζ potential can be substantially high so that the properties of preformed surface nanobubbles will be affected. This paper will thus readdress the long-held universal notion that added salt, no matter in what concentration, will not influence the properties of preformed surface nanobubble...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) fibers {{are interesting}} alternatives to carbon fibers as fibrous reinforcement. However, good interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the matrix {{is difficult to}} control. Wetting of the fiber reinforcement with the matrix strongly determines the interfacial strength. Therefore, accurate characterization of the wettability of CNT fibers {{is one of the}} most important cornerstones to improve the interfacial adhesion. In this work, dynamic contact angle measurements were conducted on individual CNT fibers by using a modified tensiometric method based on the Wilhelmy method combined with a synchronized optical observation. The CNT fiber-liquid interactions were monitored in-situ, and accurate measurements of the contact angles were achieved. Contact angles on CNTs were estimated through a modified Cassie-Baxter model on the basis of the experimental contact angle values of CNT fibers. Subsequently, the non-polar and polar surface energy components of the CNTs were obtained. Then, the wetting parameters (work of adhesion, spreading coefficient and <b>wetting</b> <b>tension)</b> were predicted by using the surface energy values of both the CNTs and a series of polymers (PP, MAPP, PET, PVDF, and PVA).

Quatre tambours en acier inoxydable, en polychlorure de vinyle, en polypropylène et en dérivé fluorocarboné de {{tensions}} critiques de mouillage différentes sont testés comparativement {{en fonction}} de l'histoire de leur expositionvis-à-vis de phases hydrocarbure (kérosène) et eau. Les essais réalisés montrent que seuls les tambours en dérivé fluorocarboné de très faible tension critique de mouillage s'avèrent intéressants pour des utilisations industrielles. En effet, ils présentent un comportement indépendant de l'histoire de leur exposition ce qui les rend très faciles à utiliser, sans précautions particulières, du fait de leur très grande sélectivité vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures. Par contre, les autres tambours, qui présentent des contributions polaires non négligeables à leur énergie de surface, ont des comportements vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures fonction de l'histoire de leur exposition et ne s'avèrent pas sélectifs vis-à-vis des hydrocarbures à récupérer. The {{aim of this}} article is to analyze the influence of the surface energy of a deoiling drum on its gathering efficiency and selectivity. The project consists in testing drums having the same size but made of materials having different surface energies so as to evaluate the influence of this key parameter that had previously been poorly analyzed. Four materials were chosen : stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and a fluorocarbon derivative. These materials are representative, a priori, of the behavior of most materials because of the position of their critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> (gamma c) compared to the superficial tension values of water (72 dyn/cm) and the hydrocarbon phases to be gathered (25 to 35 dyn/cm) (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the fluorocarbon derivative drum tested was patented by our laboratory and is currently marketed by Société Elf. To simulate industrial conditions of the use of deoiling drums, we chose a tangential rotation speed of 0. 24 m/s, appreciably corresponding to the rotation speed of Elf drums. Likewise, the pollution sequences performed in the laboratory were examined to simulate the different working conditions of an industrial drum. Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show the volumes of kerosine and water gathered for each of the four drums as a function of time, together with the cumulative volumes of kerosine added to the test tank (Fig. 2) to simulate sequential pollution. The experimental results obtained reveal the different types of behavior by deoiling drums according to the nature of the material making them up : 1) If all the drums tested were first immersed in and imbibed by the kerosine phase before being immersed in water, they were able to recover the polluting kerosine phase under excellent conditions. No appreciable difference in behavior was found among the different materials (Fig. 17). 2) At the end of the recovery of the initial pollution, with the drums rotating in water, three different types of behavior could be seen as a function of time. The steel drum immediately forms a very large film of water over its entire surface area (Fig. 5). The PVC and polypropylene drums are not immediately covered by water after the disappearance of the kerosine film. However, after several hours, a slight rise in the water film can be seen in preferential areas of the drums. This dynamic phenomenon increased in time, and after 24 hours of operating the entire surface area of the drums was covered by a homogeneous water film (Figs. 6 c and 7 c). Only the fluorocarbon-derivative drum, after having entirely recovered the hydrocarbon phase, was not covered by water after 24 hours. It thus proves to be very advantageous from the industrial standpoint since it is highly selective with regard to hydrocarbons. 3) After this conditioning phase in water during 24 hours, recovery of the second pollution phase led to two very different behaviors between the steel drum and the three plastic drums. The stainless-steel drum continued, despite the presence of a layer of 3 cm of kerosine on the surface, to bring up the same amount of water. On the contrary, the three other drums immediately raised a very large film of kerosine. To conclude, these tests reveal three types of extreme behaviors that are representative, a priori, of the materials as a whole. Materials with high surface energy of the metal type cannot raise a hydrocarbon phase under good conditions unless they are previously wetted hence conditioned by this hydrocarbon phase. Such materials are thus of little interest for the continuous specific recovery of hydrocarbon phases. Materials with low surface energy such as plastics can be classified in two groups :- Standard plastics with a critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> of greater than 30 dyn/cm, and which often have appreciable polar contributions to the surface energy to be recovered without prior conditioning of the drum by a hydrocarbon phase. However, after prolonged contact with water, such drums take up large amount of water. In effect, they are suitable only for sequential operating under the control of an operator. - On the other hand, drums made of fluorocarbon derivatives with very low critical <b>wetting</b> <b>tension</b> proved to be highly selective with regard to hydrocarbons, and above all they do not take up water. Such drums marketed on a large scale by Société Elf thus lend themselves to continuous autonomous operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{adhesion}} between polymers {{and concrete}} {{is complex and}} needs to be studied with adequate methods. One problem is about the best test to determine adhesion strength. The use of traditional tests like direct tension, flexure or shear, normally does not enable the correct determination of the adhesion strength. If the adhesive is good and the substrate’s surfaces are well prepared, the failure is in the substrate. With this kind of faitures it is possible to say that adhesion strength is higher than the failure stress. It is not possible to give a numerical value of adhesion strength. A test based on fracture mechanics makes the determination of adhesion strength easier. The use of a notched specimen concentrates the stresses in the poliymer/substrate joint and adhesive failures are more frequent. With adhesive failures, it is possibie to determine the numerical value of the adhesion strength. The results’ analysis of adhesion tests needs to be made using appropriate methods. The presentation of the results is made in accordance with a square optimisation method where the adhesion in tension and the failure mode are taken into consideration. The use of this method is exemplified with results of adhesion tests for concrete/epoxies resins.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} {{experimental studies of}} the interfacial behaviour of surfactants and enzymes at model surfaces. The main technique used throughout the work was ellipsometry. Studies of surfactant adsorption in static and dynamic wetting situations were performed to investigate adsorption behaviour close to the three-phase contact line (tpl) during dynamic wetting. It was demonstrated for a hydrophobic substrate and a non-ionic surfactant that the dynamic wetting behaviour is strongly affected by surfactant transport over the advancing tpl. This transport route appears to determine the adsorption at the interfaces joining in the tpl and thus also the dynamic <b>wetting</b> <b>tension.</b> It was concluded that the adsorption rate-determining step was the diffusion of surfactant from the bulk solution to the liquid/vapour interface. In contrast to the hydrophobic substrate surfactant carry-over across the tpl to hydrophilic silica substrates was much less efficient. Apparently the reassembly into the surface bilayer/micellar structures which form at the hydrophilic surface is a slower process than simply transferring surfactants from one monolayer at the liquid-vapour interface to another at the hydrophobic solid-liquid interface. Binary surfactant systems comprising cationic and non-ionic surfactants were also studied at hydrophobic solid surfaces in static and dynamic wetting situations. Adsorption isotherms indicated that below the cmc the surface layer consisted almost exclusively of the low solubility non-ionic surfactant. At higher surfactant concentrations the cationic surfactant mixes into the layer. Furthermore, the equilibrium adsorption behaviour was mirrored in the kinetics of desorption. The measured desorption curves indicated a transitional compositional changes and back-diffusion of the non-ionic surfactant due {{to changes in the}} concentration gradients of the two components within the diffusion zone. Adsorption and wetting force measurements, measured during substrate immersion were found to correlate to the equilibrium adsorption behaviour. In a comparison of surfactant adsorption measurements performed by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and ellipsometry, the question of consistency and complementary of the two techniques were addressed. It was shown that the frequency shift obtained from the QCM experiments results in an overestimation of the adsorbed mass, due to the presence of water coupled to or trapped within the adsorbed layer. This effect was shown to be larger for a hydrophilic surface than for a hydrophobic substrate consistent with less dense surface layers and/or surface bound water. In order to facilitate studies of the interfacial behaviour of cellulose active enzymes, different methods for producing model surfaces was assessed and elaborated. The substrates produced by our modified spin-coating procedure fulfilled the demands of being chemically pure, stable in aqueous solutions, smooth and reflecting thereby allowing studies of surfactant and polymer adsorption as well as enzymatic degradation. Investigation of a commercial cellulase mixture at the cellulose model surface, showed that subsequent to an initial adsorption phase the cellulose film began to degrade with time in a concentration dependent manner. In a study where the structure of the enzyme was varied the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of the enzyme was shown {{to play a major role}} for the binding at the cellulose interface, as well as for the subsequent degradation process. Removing the CBM resulted in a lower adsorption of the cellulase and a slower rate of degradation.

40|$|Natural fibres are a {{realistic}} and ecological alternative to synthetic fibres as reinforcement for polymer composite materials {{due to their}} low cost, environmental friendliness, natural abundance, and mechanical properties. The latter allows the design of composite materials to meet specific mechanical properties. For instance, bamboo exhibits a combination of low density (~ 1. 4 g/cm³) and high stiffness (~ 43 GPa) and strength (~ 800 MPa), while coir fibres are not very strong and stiff, but exhibit high strain to failure (approximately 40 %). However, their potential as reinforcing agent is reduced when compatibility problems with polymer matrices arise at the interface. The generally hydrophilic nature of natural fibres produces low interfacial interactions with certain important hydrophobic thermoplastic matrices, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, leading to a poor interfacial strength. Mechanical properties of composite materials can be greatly affected by the bond strength at the fibre-matrix interface. When a composite structure is loaded, the load is transferred from the matrix to the fibres mainly through shear stresses at the interface. Load transfer increases with increasing interfacial (shear) stresses, thus improving the composite strength. The adhesion at the interface {{can be described as}} a combination of physical adhesion (related to wettability), chemical bonding, and mechanical interlocking. In this study, the wettability and compatibility of the fibre and the matrix is assessed by the analysis of their surface energies. This is done by measuring contact angles, which is a quantitative measure of solid-liquid molecular interactions and thus provides information on the surface energy of solids. This dissertation develops an interdisciplinary and integrated approach that deals with the physical, chemical, and mechanical aspects of natural bamboo fibre composite interfaces. The wetting and mechanical behaviour at the interface of smooth and isotropic synthetic fibres (glass, polyethylene terephthalate) are compared with that of a rough and anisotropic natural fibre (bamboo). Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and optical profilometry techniques were used to study the fibres topography and chemistry. A new approach, based on an autoclave treatment, to reduce the noise in performing contact angle measurements on rough natural fibre surfaces is presented. The results indicate that the high concentration of lignin on the surface of bamboo fibres is responsible for their surface wetting properties. The wetting dynamics of various test liquids on bamboo fibres is analysed by applying the molecular-kinetic theory of wetting. The surface free energy components are calculated according to the acidbase theory. These values are then used to calculate the theoretical work of adhesion, spreading coefficient, <b>wetting</b> <b>tension,</b> and interfacial energy for analysing the fibre-matrix compatibility. Additionally, a novel way to measure equilibrium contact angles by using sound excitation is proposed. This way it is possible to better take into account both polar and dispersive surface energy components. The findings suggest that the contact angle obtained by forcing relaxation through acoustic vibration is a reliable method to study the wetting behaviour of natural fibres. Moreover, understanding of the stress state in the composite after processing and during mechanical testing is required for a correct analysis of adhesion properties. The mechanical strength of the interfaces was assessed by single fibre pull-out tests, and transverse 3 -point bending tests. The fibre matrix interfacial bond strength was characterized by the critical local value of interfacial shear stress. Since during crack initiation in the pull-out test, the crack surfaces move directly apart, it is possible to correctly relate the theoretical work of adhesion with the normal stress at the debond point. This radial normal stress at the interface at the moment of crack initiation is also used in this study as a parameter for correlating thermodynamic work of adhesion and practical adhesion. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  <w:latentstyles=""  status: publishe...|$|E

They present {{a wide range}} of petrographic characteristics that provide degrees of connectivity, porosities, pore size distributions, water absorption coefficients by capillarity and water permeabilities. A statistical analysis shows strong correlations among the petrophysical parameters of the studied rocks. Several fundamental properties are fitted into different linear and multiple expressions where water permeability is expressed as a generalized function of the properties. Some practical aspects of these correlations are highlighted in order to use capillary imbibition tests to estimate permeability. The permeability–porosity relation is discussed {{in the context of the}} influence of pore connectivity and wettability. As a consequence, we propose a generalized model for permeability that includes information about water fluid rate (water absorption coefficient by capillarity), water properties (density and viscosity), <b>wetting</b> (interfacial <b>tension</b> and contact angle) and pore structure (pore radius and porosity). Its application is examined in terms of the type of pores that contribute to water transport and wettability.

The first study (covered in three papers) presents results from characterisation of a matrix of water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface <b>tension,</b> <b>wetting,</b> and fulltone printing performance on PE-coated board. The commercial water-based inks used vary in type of pigment and acrylic vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. For all mixing proportions, the inks were shear thinning, with viscosity increasing strongly with content of solution (versus emulsion) polymer in the vehicle. Increasing amount of solution polymer also gave the indirect consequence of lower surface <b>tension</b> values. The <b>wet</b> ink amount transferred to the board and the resulting print uniformity responded sensitively to ink formulation and could be correlated to the corresponding changes in these two ink properties. Transferred amount correlated well with ink plastic viscosity and static surface tension, exhibiting a maximum at intermediate values of both. Print mottle decreased with increasing content of solution polymer, principally due to the associated increase in low-shear viscosity and decreased surface tension, both serving to reduce substrate dewetting. In the second study, the effect of corona discharge treatment of PE-coated board on its surface chemistry and print resistance properties was evaluated. The increase in total surface energy, due to its polar component, with increasing corona level was strongly correlated to surface oxidation fraction from XPS. AFM revealed oxidised material nano-mounds, which increased in size and substrate coverage with corona level. Wet rub resistance (with water) first increased for lower corona dosages before decreasing at higher dosages. This worsened water resistance at higher dosages is presumably due to the oxidised material dissolved and dispersed in the ink film. The third study presents results from another set of water-based acrylic inks printed on boards coated with PE, OPP and PP. Print quality and resistance properties, though dependent on the polymer type, were strongly influenced by the choice of emulsion polymer and presence of silicone additive in the vehicle, with corona treatment level playing a lesser role. The emulsion polymer giving best resistance performance was generally found to give poorest press performance and visual appearance. Again the trends could be understood in terms of <b>wet</b> ink surface <b>tension</b> (versus substrate surface energy), dictating print uniformity, and dry print surface energy (and swellability), dictating resistance properties.

A large number of commercial and some novel Brunel synthesised surfactants have been studied {{with a view to}} their potential usefulness for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application. Ethoxylated phenols and their sulphonated derivatives were given especially high priority. The surfactants were well-characterised in order to understand their EOR potential. High pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and other quantitative techniques were used. Aspects of their behaviour (as single components and as blends with co-surfactants and co-solvents) which have been considered in terms of: (i) phase behaviour with brine and hydrocarbons (ii) adsorption onto various oxide surfaces (iii) interfacial properties such as surface <b>tension,</b> <b>wetting,</b> contact angles and viscosity (iv) stability Three different blends using sulphonated surfactants which: (i) produce a microeinulsion which is stable to high salinity brines over a large temperature range (ii) exhibit low adsorption onto reservoir rock (iii) interfacial tension as low as 10 - 2 mNm- 1 have been subsequently optimised.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is {{concerned}} with thestructure-property relationships in nonionic surfactantsystems. The main aim was to investigate how the surfactantstructure influences the adsorption at interfaces andinteractions between surfactant coated interfaces. Particularly, the effect {{of the structure of the}} surfactantheadgroups was investigated. These were sugar-based headgroupwith varying size and flexibility and poly(ethylene oxide) based headgroups with or without an additional amide or estergroup. The hydrophobic part of the surfactant consisted mostlyof straight alkyl chains, except for one type of poly(ethyleneoxide) based surfactant with a dehydroabietic hydrophobe. The main technique that was used is the surface forcetechnique, with which the forces acting between two adsorbedsurfactant layers on hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces can bemeasured. These forces are important for e. g. the stability ofdispersions. The hydrophilic surfaces employed were glass andmica, whereas the hydrophobic surfaces were silanized glass andhydrophobized mica. The adsorption behavior on hydrophilicsurfaces is highly dependent on the type of headgroup andsurface, whereas similar results were obtained on the two typesof hydrophobic surfaces. To better understand how the surfaceforces are affected by the surfactant structure, measurementsof adsorbed amount and theoretical mean-field latticecalculations were carried out. The results show that the sugarsurfactant layers and poly(ethylene oxide) surfactant layersgive rise to very different surface forces, but that the forcesare more similar within each group. The structure-propertyrelationships for many other physical properties have beenstudied as well. These include equilibrium and dynamicadsorption at the liquid-vapor interface, micelle size, micelledynamics, and wetting. The second part in this thesis is about the aggregationbetween cationic polyelectrolytes and an anionic surfactant. The surface force technique was used to study the adsorption ofa low charged cationic polyelectrolyte on mica, and theaggregation between the adsorbed polyelectrolyte with theanionic surfactant. The aggregation in bulk was studied withturbidimetry, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and smallangle x-ray scattering (SAXS). An internal hexagonal aggregatestructure was found for some of the bulk aggregates.

40|$|Wood shear {{walls are}} the main lateral force-resisting system for wood-frame construction. Water {{intrusion}} and subsequent decay around connections can significantly impact shear wall behavior, but these problems are seldom studied. In this study, effects of water intrusion and fungal attack on shear wall capacity were examined using small-scale (610 - x 610 -mm) shear walls that were monitored with time using destructive monotonic tests. Results were compared with tests of dry and water control samples. Although fungal colonization was not successful under the conditions tested, wetting (with or without fungal inoculation) produced interesting effects on shear wall capacity. Wetting alone initially increased shear wall capacity, possibly because of fastener corrosion. Observations and digital image correlation data suggest that tensile forces in the uplift corner of the shear walls governed failure modes, which were primarily nail withdrawal, nail pull-through, flake debonding, and cross-grain <b>tension.</b> <b>Wetting</b> affected rigidity of oriented strandboard and led to more frequent nail pull-through. Although failure loads did not differ between the groups, failure modes and displacement at maximum load suggested decreased performance of wetted shear walls. The results suggest that slight amounts (8 % overall) of wetting do not negatively affect shear wall performance. However, the effects of prolonged wetting on capacity merit further study...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the use of}} oil-in-water (O/W) {{emulsions}} as metalworking fluids is widespread, {{the mechanisms}} of emulsion lubrication are not yet well understood. Several theories have been proposed {{but there is not}} a clear agreement about the effect of different operating conditions and emulsion properties on the lubricating performance of O/W emulsions. In the present study, the film forming ability of O/W emulsions as a function of emulsifier concentration is studied. The emulsifier content exerts a strong influence on all the emulsion properties, such as stability, droplet size distribution, surface and interfacial <b>tension,</b> <b>wetting</b> ability, etc., {{as well as on the}} lubricating behaviour, so it has been used to ascertain the relationship between all the properties involved. Three different emulsifiers—anionic, nonionic and cationic—were used at different concentrations in the design of lubricant O/W emulsions. Experimental results show that the work of adhesion of oil droplets on the metal surface is a valuable parameter to predict the ability of emulsions to form thick films in elastohydrodynamic (EHD) contacts. The influence of pH value of O/W emulsions on their lubricating behaviour is also verified. The overall conclusion is that the interactions between metal and oil droplets rule the mechanism of lubrication and that this interaction is primarily controlled by emulsifier concentration...|$|R

40|$|In {{the waste}} water {{treatment}} industry, a novel gas sparger based on flexible membranes {{has been used for}} the last ten years. The objective of the present work is to study the bubble formation generated from a flexible orifice (membrane). Firstly, the membranes are characterised with regard to their properties: <b>wetting</b> critical surface <b>tension,</b> expanding hole diameter, orifice coefficients, flexibility, critical and elastic pressures. The bubble formation phenomenon in an inviscid liquid at rest is studied experimentally for different membranes and gas flow rates. The variation in the bubble diameter, the bubble centre of gravity and the bubble spread on the membrane are determined as a function of time. An analytic model is proposed to describe the bubble growth and its detachment at a flexible orifice. This theoretical approach, developed by Teresaka & Tsuge (1990) for rigid orifices, is adapted {{to take into account the}} membrane features (elastic behaviour and wettability). The predicted bubble diameters at detachment agree with the experimental measurements; however, the model underestimates slightly the bubble formation times. The calculation of the various forces acting on the bubble in the vertical direction indicates that the real forces governing the bubble growth are the buoyancy force, the surface tension force, and near detachment the inertial force...|$|R
40|$|The Landau-de Gennes {{free energy}} {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the interaction between long cylindrical colloids and the nematic-isotropic (NI) interface. This interaction has two contributions: one is specific of liquid crystals and results from the deformation of the director field close to the particles or to the interface, while the other is generic and results from <b>wetting</b> and surface <b>tension</b> effects. Deep in the nematic phase the director field of long cylindrical colloids, with strong homeotropic anchoring, exhibits two half-integer defect lines. As the colloid moves towards the interface, the director configuration changes through a series of discontinuous transitions, where {{one or two of the}} defects are annihilated. In addition, the NI interface bends towards the colloid in order to minimize the elastic free energy in the nematic. In the isotropic phase, the colloid is surrounded by a thin nematic layer that reduces the surface free energy under favorable wetting conditions. The interaction has a well-defined minimum near the interface. In this region the director and interfacial structures are complex and cannot be described analytically. Using the numerical results for the Landau-de Gennes free energy in the harmonic region, we obtained simple scaling laws for the (linear) force on the colloid...|$|R
