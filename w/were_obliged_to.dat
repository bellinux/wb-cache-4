5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> push their trains out of the station before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E

5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> submit to Roman rule.|$|E

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E

5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25March 1959 following the departure of the last coal wagon.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{inception}} of the program in 1955, around 20,000 CIP licenses were granted, but it was determined that the progress was too unwieldy to manage, so the number of licenses was decreased and people <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> assemble into conglomerates to access the scheme. At first, inflation was regarded as such a pressing concern that there were very few limitations on what could be imported, the most notable restrictions being alcohol and jewellery. It was reasoned that more restrictions on imports would cause a lack of supply of goods, causing price increases. However, restrictions were increased in the next three years to an average of 75.|$|E

These came from 32 countries. 41 riders – approximately a fifth of the peloton – were French; no other nation had more than 20 riders in the race. Merhawi Kudus and Daniel Teklehaimanot were the first ever Eritrean riders to participate in the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|At the Country Disc Jockey Convention {{in early}} November, Presley was voted the year's most {{promising}} male artist. Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him. After three major labels made offers {{of up to}} $25,000, Parker and Phillips {{struck a deal with}} RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000. Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract. Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters <b>were</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions. By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.|$|E
