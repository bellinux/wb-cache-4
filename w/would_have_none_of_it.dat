5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E

25|$|Sacken <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Against {{the advice}} of his own staff who urged him to move closer to Yorck, the Russian {{commander}} deployed his army corps with its main weight to the south. Strictly following his orders, Sacken determined to smash his way east through Montmirail. At the start of the battle Napoleon was significantly outnumbered and could only defend with 5,000 Old Guard infantry, 4,500 cavalry, Ricard's division and 36 guns. Because of the bad condition of the roads and the exhaustion of the soldiers, it was not clear whether French reinforcements or Yorck's Prussians would first arrive on the field. Napoleon was taking a huge risk.|$|E
500|$|While Madero {{was ready}} to {{negotiate}} with Díaz and hold off from attacking, Villa and Orozco <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> On May 8 the two generals launched {{an assault on the}} city without consulting Madero and blamed it on a [...] "spontaneous" [...] outbreak in fighting. The incident that served as an excuse for the offensive occurred when a federal officer insulted a female rebel on a bridge between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. Madero attempted to halt the violence but Orozco and Villa pressed on. Both of them {{went to great lengths to}} avoid Madero so they wouldn't have to disobey a direct order. Even when Villa was eventually confronted by Castulo Herrera with explicit instructions to stop fighting, he simply ignored him. Likewise, when Madero finally managed to see Orozco in person, he was simply told that the battle was already raging and it was too late to stop it.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had been}} {{expected}} to adhere to Whig Party policies and to defer to party congressional leaders, particularly Clay. When Tyler succeeded him, he initially concurred with the new Whig Congress, signing into law the preemption bill granting [...] "squatters' sovereignty" [...] to settlers on public land, a Distribution Act (discussed below), a new bankruptcy law, and {{the repeal of the}} Independent Treasury. But {{when it came to the}} great banking question, Tyler was soon at odds with the Congressional Whigs, and twice vetoed Clay's legislation for a national banking act. Although the second bill was originally tailored to meet his objections in the first veto, its final version did not. This practice, designed to protect Clay from having a successful incumbent president as a rival for the Whig nomination in 1844, became known as [...] "heading Captain Tyler", a term coined by Whig Representative John Minor Botts of Virginia. Tyler proposed an alternative fiscal plan known as the [...] "Exchequer", but Clay's friends who controlled the Congress <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|Devers {{conceded that}} he would {{only be able to}} supply Patton with [...] per day from 15 November, which only {{increased}} Eisenhower's resolve to give priority to opening the port of Antwerp in the north. Devers was ordered to clear the Germans from {{the west bank of the}} Rhine in his sector. His offensive went well; the French 1st Armored Division reached the Rhine on 19 November, and Leclerc captured Strasbourg on 23 November. Devers inflicted a crushing defeat on General Friedrich Wiese's Nineteenth Army, nearly destroying six of its eight divisions. A large German presence remained west of the Rhine, which came to be called the Colmar Pocket. When Eisenhower and Bradley visited 6th Army Group on 24 November, they were astonished to find Devers, Patch and Haislip energetically planning a crossing of the Rhine in early December. Bradley drew attention to the formidable defenses on the far bank, and Devers told him that he had spoken to patrols that had found them empty. Eisenhower <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> His strategy remained to destroy the German forces on the west bank before attempting a crossing. The official historians described this decision as [...] "difficult to understand".|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's term {{as mayor}} was spent {{fighting}} the entrenched {{interests of the}} party machines. Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council. The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> His veto message said, [...] "I regard it as {{the culmination of a}} most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money." [...] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted. For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.|$|E
500|$|Brunner was {{disappointed}} at {{the condition of}} the land {{along the banks of the}} Buller River as it neared the coast. [...] He had briefly scouted the area on his previous journey and believed it had potential for pastoral farming. He now found it too damp and mossy to be cultivated. The party reached the mouth of the Buller on 1 June and made their way to the pā that Brunner and Heaphy had stayed at on their last journey but on arrival, found that it had been abandoned. They continued on down to the Arahura River and reached the Taramakau Pā where they stayed for three months over the worst of the winter months. On 12 October, Brunner continued south with some local Māori. He went as far south as Tititira Head, near Paringa where in December he severely sprained his ankle. After recovering, he decided to make his way back to Taramakau Pā. From here he along with his companions, journeyed up the Arahura River and in late January 1848, discovered the coalfield and lake which now bears his name. He wanted to continue on this route to Canterbury but Kehu and Pitewate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The party began to make their way back to Nelson.|$|E

Guderian reached Marle, 80 kilometres from Sedan, Rommel crossed the river Sambre at Le Cateau, a hundred kilometres from his bridgehead, Dinant. While nobody knew the whereabouts of Rommel (he had advanced so quickly that he was out of range for radio contact, earning his 7th Panzer Division the nickname Gespenster-Division, [...] "Ghost Division"), an enraged von Kleist flew to Guderian on the morning of the 17 and after a heated argument relieved him of all duties.

2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from Somerset, Close {{continued to play}} at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the wicket-keeper and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay, but Close <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> – he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: [...] "It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up." [...] Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches.|$|E
2500|$|The Middle Paleolithic in {{the modern}} sense made its {{appearance}} in 1911 in the 1st edition of William Johnson Sollas' Ancient Hunters. It {{had been used in}} varying senses before then. Sollas associates the period with the Mousterian technology and the relevant modern people with the Tasmanians. In the 2nd edition of 1915 he has changed his mind for reasons that are not clear. The Mousterian has been moved to the Lower Paleolithic and the people changed to the Australian aborigines; furthermore, the association has been made with Neanderthals and the Levalloisian added. Sollas says wistfully that they are in [...] "the very middle of the Palaeolithic epoch." [...] Whatever his reasons, the public <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> From 1911 on, Mousterian was Middle Paleolithic, except for holdouts. Alfred L. Kroeber in 1920, Three essays on the antiquity and races of man, reverting to Lower Paleolithic, explains that he is following Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet. The English-speaking public remained with Middle Paleolithic.|$|E

2500|$|The President {{may require}} the [...] "principal officer" [...] of any {{executive}} department to tender his advice in writing. While the Constitution nowhere requires a formal Cabinet, it does authorize {{the president to}} seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as he (or she) performs their official duties. George Washington found it prudent to organize his principal officers into a Cabinet, {{and it has been}} part of the executive branch structure ever since. Presidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government to President Abraham Lincoln, but was rebuffed. Later, Woodrow Wilson advocated use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet while he was a professor, but as President he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in his administration. In recent administrations, cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven subcabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent Presidents have followed that practice.|$|E
2500|$|Bismarck had {{at first}} tried to rouse the peasants of his estate into an army to march on Berlin in the King's name. He {{travelled}} to Berlin in disguise {{to offer his}} services, but was instead told to make himself useful by arranging food supplies for the Army from his estates in case they were needed. The King's brother, Prince Wilhelm, had fled to England, and Bismarck intrigued with Wilhelm's wife Augusta to place their teenage son Frederick William on the Prussian throne in Frederick William IV's place. Augusta <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and detested Bismarck thereafter, {{despite the fact that}} he later helped restore a working relationship between the King and his brother Wilhelm. Bismarck was not yet a member of the Landtag, the lower house of the new Prussian legislature. The liberal movement perished by the end of 1848 amid internal fighting. Meanwhile, the conservatives regrouped, formed an inner group of advisers—including the Gerlach brothers, known as the [...] "Camarilla"—around the King, and retook control of Berlin. Although a constitution was granted, its provisions fell far short of the demands of the revolutionaries.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} how Governor Milan, his sick body racked with fever almost from the first, restlessly {{suspicious}} and ofttimes with reason of his fellow men, jealous of his official power and position, administered the affairs of St. Thomas during his sixteen months' incumbency may be dealt with rather briefly. In Captain Meyer's attempt to provide the Fortuna, [...] with a good return cargo, the governor took but an indifferent interest, and as to the Esmits' returning on the Fortuna, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Just why he should deliberately keep with him persons who could not but {{be a source of}} trouble {{as long as they were}} near, is difficult to explain on other grounds than cupidity. Milan had been unable to lay his hands on Esmit's gains. In his relations with his council, he showed his arbitrariness and wilfulness. In place of Lieutenant Heins, who happened to be absent on the company's business when Milan arrived, the governor promptly appointed his son, Felix. Instead of selecting permanent councilors from among the planters as he had been instructed to do under certain specified conditions, he put in now one, now another, until fourteen planters had taken part in the government with him.|$|E
2500|$|When Pope Paul III died on 10 November 1549, {{at the age}} of eighty-one, Cardinal de Tournon {{and seven}} other {{cardinals}} set out for Rome and the Conclave.

[...] Another French Cardinal, Georges d'Armagnac, arrived on 28 December. [...] Cardinal Louis de Bourbon de Vendôme, who was the French candidate (or so Cardinal de Guise had been advised by the King) was one of the latest arrivals, not reaching Rome until 14 January 1550. [...] Tournon's name had been given to Guise as an alternate, if Bourbon de Vendome's candidacy should falter. In fact neither had a chance. Queen Catherine apparently favored Cardinal Ridolfi (who died on 31 January 1550) and then Cardinal d'Este (who was [...] a non-starter). [...] The leading candidates in the voting were Reginald Pole (the Imperial favorite), Giovanni Morone, and Gian Pietro Carafa. [...] As happened so frequently, the French and the Imperialists excluded each other's candidates. It would be Cardinal Farnese, or rather, whichever party could make an arrangement with Farnese for his votes, who would decide the election. [...] Farnese knew that he could not become pope himself, but he was determined that a member of his group would. The French and Farnese tried Marcello Cervini, but the Imperialists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] It had come down to a choice between two unpalatable candidates: Cervini and del Monte.
