2500|$|Glutathione {{plays an}} {{important}} role in preventing oxidative damage to the skin. In addition to its many recognized biological functions, glutathione has also been associated with skin lightening ability. The role of glutathione as a skin whitener was discovered as a side effect of large doses of glutathione. Glutathione utilizes different mechanisms to exert its action as a skin <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> at various levels of melanogenesis. It inhibits melanin synthesis by means of stopping the neurotransmitter precursor L-DOPA's ability to interact with tyrosinase in the process of melanin production. Glutathione inhibits the actual production as well as agglutination of melanin by interrupting the function of L-DOPA. Another study found that glutathione inhibits melanin formation by direct inactivation of the enzyme tyrosinase by binding and chelating copper within the enzyme's active site. Glutathione's antioxidant property allows it to inhibit melanin synthesis by quenching of free radicals and peroxides that contribute to tyrosinase activation and melanin formation. [...] Its antioxidant property also protects the skin from UV radiation and other environmental as well as internal stressors that generate free radicals that cause skin damage and hyperpigmentation. In most mammals, melanin formation consists of eumelanin (brown-black pigment) and pheomelanin ( [...] yellow-red pigment) as either mixtures or co-polymers. Increase in glutathione level may induce the pigment cell to produce pheomelanin instead of eumelanin pigments. A research by Te-Sheng Chang found lowest levels of reduced glutathione to be associated with eumelanin type pigmentation, whereas the highest ones were associated with the pheomelanin. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that depletion of glutathione would result in eumelanin formation. Prota [...] observed that decreased glutathione concentration led to the conversion of L-Dopaquinone to Dopachrome, increasing the formation of brown-black pigment (eumelanin).|$|E

40|$|Zircon is {{the main}} {{opacifier}} in the ceramic sector, however its high cost limits its wide use and {{has led to the}} search of alternative materials.

50|$|Melanosome transfer: Melanosomes {{along with}} the melanin they contain is {{transferred}} from melanocytes to keratinocytes when keratinocytes are low in the epidermis.

5000|$|Internal {{staining}} of dentin can discolor {{the teeth}} from inside out. Internal bleaching can remedy this on root canal treated teeth. Internal bleaching procedures are performed on devitalized teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment (root canal treatment) but are discolored due to internal staining of the tooth structure by blood and other fluids that leaked in. Unlike external bleaching, which brightens teeth {{from the outside}} in, internal bleaching brightens teeth from the inside out. Bleaching the tooth internally involves drilling a hole to the pulp chamber, cleaning, sealing, and filling the root canal with gutta-percha points, and placing a peroxide gel or sodium perborate tetrahydrate into the pulp chamber so they can work directly inside the tooth on the dentin layer. In this variation of whitening the <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> is sealed within the tooth {{over a period of}} some days and replaced as needed, the so-called [...] "walking bleach" [...] technique.. A seal should be placed over the root filling material to minimise microleakage. There is a small risk of external resorption.|$|E

Scanning electron microscopy provided images of the cylindrical fibers with dimensions of 3. 5 cm (length) and 13. 3 mu m (thickness), with empty cores of 1 mu m diameter and a smooth surface. Atomic force microscopy showed a fiber surface with disoriented nanometric domains using both tapping-mode height and phase image modes.
