25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his <b>weight</b> <b>supported</b> by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee's judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) causes damage to nerve roots and fibers that carry {{messages}} {{to and from}} the brain. Spinal cord injuries can result from physical trauma, tumors, developmental disorders or a number of different diseases. In 1995, Christopher Reeve, known for his role in all three Superman movies, was thrown from his horse and landed headfirst into a fence shattering his first and second vertebrae. Reeve’s cervical spinal injury paralyzed him from the neck down. Reeve sought the aid of Dr. John McDonald, who was working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. After extensive activity-based therapies, Reeve was able to wiggle his toes and move a couple of fingers. Christopher Reeve died in 2004, however his achievements shined light on everyone affected by spinal cord injuries. Dr. McDonald left St. Louis and officially opened the International Center for Spinal Cord Injury (ICSCI) at Kennedy Krieger Institute on June 14, 2005. ICSCI {{is one of the first}} centers to have a focus specifically on children with chronic spinal cord injuries and paralysis. The center utilizes innovative activity-based therapies such as FES cycling, aquatic therapy, and partial <b>weight</b> <b>supported</b> walking to help patients regain sensation and feeling in their bodies. The center combines clinical research with a focus on restoration and rehabilitation for children and adults with chronic paralysis.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> influences the stride length (SL) –velocity as well as leg impact acceleration relationship during running. Methods: Subjects (n =  10, 21. 4  ±  2. 0 years, 72. 4  ±  10. 3  kg, 1. 76  ±  0. 09  m) completed 16 run conditions consisting of specific body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> and velocity combinations. Velocities tested were 100 %, 110 %, 120 %, and 130 % of the preferred velocity (2. 75  ±  0. 36  m/s). Body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> conditions consisted of 0, 60 %, 70 %, and 80 % body <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> SL and leg impact accelerations were determined using a light-weight accelerometer mounted on the surface of the anterior-distal aspect of the tibia. A 4  ×  4 (velocity × body <b>weight</b> <b>support)</b> repeated measures ANOVA was used for each dependent variable (α =  0. 05). Results: Neither SL nor leg impact acceleration were influenced by the interaction of body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> and velocity (p >  0. 05). SL was least during no body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (p    0. 05). Leg impact acceleration was greatest during no body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (p    0. 05).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> on the gait of hemiparetic subjects walking on a treadmill. Design: Survey. Patients: Eleven nonambulatory hemi-paretic subjects. Methods: Subjects walked on the treadmill with full weight bearing and with 15 %, 30 %, 45 %, and 60 % body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> at constant walking veloc-ity. Cycle parameters, symmetry ratios, and the kinematic EMG of several lower limb muscles of the affected leg were recorded. Video-analysis served for assessment of pos-ture and hip and knee angle displacement. Results: With body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> the rel-ative double support time decreased, the relative single stance period of the affected limb increased, and the functional activity of the vastus and soleus diminished. The activity of the gluteus tended to increase. Patients walked more upright and with less hip and knee flexion. The extensor spasticity did not change and the qualitative acti-vation pattern of all recorded muscles remained unchanged. Conclusion: Body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> did not facilitate a less physiological gait. By reducing double <b>support</b> dura-tion, body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> resulted in a greater stimulus for balance training. The facil-itation of gluteus medius is favorable with respect to training pelvic alignment. The reduction of the activity of other antigravity muscles suggests a limit of 30 % BWS not be exceeded.

25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body <b>weight</b> <b>supported</b> treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and foot, and a third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E

40|$|Unlike adult spinalized rats, {{approximately}} 20 % of rats spinalized as postnatal day 1 or 2 (P 1 /P 2) neonates achieve autonomous hindlimb <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> Cortical {{representations of}} mid/low trunk occur only in such rats with high <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> However, {{the importance of}} hindlimb/trunk motor cortex in function of spinalized rats remains unclear. We tested the importance of trunk sensorimotor cortex in their locomotion using lesions guided by cortical microstimulation in P 1 /P 2 weight-supporting neonatal spinalized rats and controls. In four intact control rats, lesions of hindlimb/trunk cortex caused no treadmill deficits. All spinalized rats lesioned in trunk cortex (n = 16 : 4 transplant, 6 transect, 6 transect + fibrin glue) lost {{an average of about}} 40 % of their <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> Intact trunk cortex was essential to their level of function. Lesion of trunk cortex substantially increased roll of the hindquarters, which correlated to diminished <b>weight</b> <b>support,</b> but other kinematic stepping parameters showed little change.

We tested the role of novel relay circuits arising from the grafts in such cortical representations in E 14 transplants using the rats that received (noncellular) fibrin glue grafting at P 1 /P 2 (8 allografts and 32 xenografts). Fibrin-repaired rats with autonomous <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> also had trunk cortical representations similar to those of E 14 transplant rats.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has shown that body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (BWS) has the potential to improve gait speed for individuals post-stroke. However, body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> also reduces the optimal walking speed at which energy use is minimized over the gait cycle indicating that BWS should reduce walking speed capability. Methods Nonimpaired subjects and subjects post-stroke walked at a self-selected speed over a 15 m walkway. Body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (BWS) was provided to subjects at 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % of the subject's weight while they walked overground using a robotic body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> system. Gait speed, cadence, and average step length were calculated for each subject using recorded data on their time to walk 10 m and the number of steps taken. Results When subjected to greater levels of BWS, self-selected walking speed decreased for the nonimpaired subjects. However, subjects post-stroke showed an average increase of 17 % in self-selected walking speed when subjected to some level of BWS compared to the 0 % BWS condition. Most subjects showed this increase at the 10 % BWS level. Gait speed increases corresponded to an increase in step length, but not cadence. Conclusions The BWS training environment results in decreased self-selected walking speed in nonimpaired individuals, however self-selected overground walking speed is facilitated when provided with a small percentage of body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> for people post-stroke. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background To provide body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> during {{walking and}} balance training, one can employ two {{distinct}} embodiments: support through a harness hanging from an overhead system or support through a saddle/seat type. This paper presents {{a comparison of}} these two approaches. Ultimately, this comparison determined our selection of the body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> system employed in the MIT-Skywalker, a robotic device developed for the rehabilitation/habilitation of gait and balance after a neurological injury. Method Here we will summarize our results with eight healthy subjects walking on the treadmill without any support, with 30 % unloading supported by a harness hanging from an overhead system, and with a saddle/seat-like support system. We compared the center of mass as well as vertical and mediolateral trunk displacements across different walking speeds and support. Results The bicycle/saddle system had the highest values for the mediolateral inclination, while the overhead harness body <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> showed the lowest values at all speeds. The differences were statistically significant. Conclusion We selected the bicycle/saddle system for the MIT-Skywalker. It allows faster don-and-doff, better centers the patient to the split treadmill, and allows all forms of training.

40|$|Falls {{frequently}} cause injury-related hospitalization {{or death}} among older adults. This article reviews a new conceptual framework on dynamic stability and <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> {{in reducing the}} risk for falls resulting from a forward slip, based {{on the principles of}} motor control and learning, in the context of adaptation and longer-term retention induced by repeated-slip training. Although an unexpected slip is severely destabi-lizing, a recovery step often is adequate for regaining stability, regardless of age. Consequently, poor <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> (quantified by reduction in hip height), rather than instability, is the major determinant of slip-related fall risk. Promisingly, a single session of repeated-slip training can enhance neuromechanical control of dynamic stability and <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> to prevent falls, which can be retained for several months or longer. These principles provide the theoretical basis for establishing task-specific adaptive training that facilitates the development of protective strategies to reduce falls among older adults...|$|R

40|$|The ankle plantar flexor muscles, {{gastrocnemius}} (Gas) and soleus (Sol), {{have been}} shown to play important roles in providing body support and forward propulsion during human walking. However, there has been disagreement about the relative contributions of Gas and Sol to these functional tasks. In this study, using independent manipulations of body weight and body mass, we examined the relative contribution of the individual plantar flexors to support and propulsion. We hypothesized that Gas and Sol contribute to body support, whereas Sol is the primary contributor to forward trunk propulsion. We tested this hypothesis by measuring muscle activity while experimentally manipulating body weight and mass by 1) decreasing body weight using a <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> system, 2) increasing body mass alone using a combination of equal added trunk load and <b>weight</b> <b>support,</b> and 3) increasing trunk loads (increasing body weight and mass). The rationale for this study was that muscles that provide body support would be sensitive to changes in body weight, whereas muscles that provide forward propulsion would be sensitive to changes in body mass. Gas activity increased with added loads and decreased with <b>weight</b> <b>support</b> but showed only a small increase relative to control trials when mass alone was increased. Sol activity showed a similar increase with added loads and with added mass alone and decreased in early stance with <b>weight</b> <b>support.</b> Therefore, we accepted the hypothesis that Sol and Gas contribute to body support, whereas Sol is the primary contributor to forward trunk propulsion...|$|R
