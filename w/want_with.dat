5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from <b>Want</b> <b>with</b> a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E

500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do what you want, what you <b>want</b> <b>with</b> my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u <b>want</b> <b>with</b> my body/ Do what u want/ What u <b>want</b> <b>with</b> my body/ Write what you want, say what you want about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles. She wanted [...] "Cry" [...] to be released instead, but conceded that, [...] "in the end, they’re releasing it without my consent. It sucks, but it's one of those things I have no control over... At this point, the record company can do whatever they <b>want</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Tedder, however, was pleased that the song was released, saying that he likes it more than [...] "Halo". The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11, 2009. In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they <b>want</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|The first {{track on}} the EP, [...] "Smokin'", was {{commissioned}} by British television station Channel 4 for a programme about sloth presented by Howard Marks {{as part of a}} series on the seven deadly sins. The band went into Grassroots, a community recording studio in Cardiff, in June 1997 and looped a sample of the Black Uhuru track [...] "I Love King Selassie", playing along and writing [...] "Smokin'" [...] "completely spontaneously". According to singer Gruff Rhys the song is [...] "really light and up" [...] as a result of being recorded in the summer. The track's lyrics refer to smoking cannabis, with Rhys stating that it [...] "seems ridiculous that you can't do what you <b>want</b> <b>with</b> a plant that grows naturally" [...] in reference to the drug's illegal status in many countries. Rhys has claimed that he does not consider the track to be subversive, however — it is about the band's own drug use and he doesn't [...] "expect everyone who buys the record to do the same. They'd be quite sad if they did".|$|E

They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would <b>want</b> <b>with</b> him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we <b>want</b> <b>with</b> them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic", Skaff {{said that}} the song's title—a {{reference}} to Tails and Sonic from the video game series—had [...] "really came out of nowhere." [...] McKinnon said the song is a [...] "more personal song [...] It discusses how the choices I've made to put my best foot forward in my career, in a sense, have really done damage to my personal life." [...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I <b>want</b> <b>with</b> my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did something that really affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person." [...] On being asked whether he knew it would be the final song on the album, McKinnon said [...] "It just felt right [...] seemed like a good ending".|$|E

500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you <b>want</b> <b>with</b> a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, too lazy to crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E
500|$|Peng made regular {{inspection}} {{tours of}} the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks {{all the time about}} more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he <b>want</b> <b>with</b> chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] was {{released}} for streaming on Gaga's Vevo channel from September 16, 2014. Preceding the release, Gaga tweeted about {{the background of}} the song, about the death of flautist Horn, as well as about ahbez, saying [...] "This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance". Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review, saying that [...] "This song sounds like what you imagine a smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like." [...] Grow praised it as [...] "sublime", describing the track as a [...] "loungier" [...] version Gaga and Bennett's collaboration. Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the [...] "magic" [...] of the song really happened once Bennett's vocals were heard, following Gaga's singing and the orchestration. Lewis said that [...] "It's not exactly 'Do What You <b>Want</b> <b>with</b> My Body', but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was [...] "treated with the greatest delicacy". He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga's [...] "vulnerable" [...] vocals and Bennett's [...] "assured" [...] one. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that her timbre in [...] "Nature Boy" [...] appeared inconsistent, [...] "shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical, often within just a few short bars." [...] "Nature Boy" [...] debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and within a few hours, rose to number one. It also debuted at number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart. In Russia, it peaked at number 259 on the official Tophit airplay chart.|$|E

500|$|Inevitably {{linked with}} Roosevelt, Taft {{generally}} {{falls in the}} shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider, who chose him to be president, and who took it away. Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, [...] "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?" [...] Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation. Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence in talking to reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the <b>want</b> <b>with</b> a quote from a Taft opponent. And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor. While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.|$|E
