500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I found {{wreckage}} {{scattered all}} over the place. I saw many bodies, and a helmet like the ones used by paratroops coloured bright red. Some of them looked as if they had tried to jump. I could see collapsed parachutes with the cords at full stretch. I could see there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> for anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|IDF forces {{then began}} mopping up the final {{resistance}} in the Hawashin neighborhood. At 7:00 AM on April 11, the Palestinians began to surrender. Qabha refused to surrender and was killed, being among the last to die. Zakaria Zubeidi was among the only fighters who did not surrender. He {{slipped out of the}} area surrounded by the IDF, moved through the houses and left. Mardawi surrendered along with Ali Suleiman al-Saadi, known as [...] "Safouri", and thirty-nine others. He later said that [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> against that bulldozer".|$|E
2500|$|ESPN's Dan Rafael {{score the}} fight 114-111 {{in favour of}} Khan. HBO's {{unofficial}} scorer, Harold Lederman, scored it 113-112, also for Khan. After the fight Khan said, [...] "It was like I was against two people, the referee and Lamont himself. I was the cleaner fighter; he was so wild. The referee wasn't giving me a chance. I heard the referee give me a warning , but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> He kept coming in with his head. There hasn't been [...] boxing in D.C. for the last [...] years {{because this is what}} happens." [...] Khan earned a base purse of [...] $1.1 million, while Peterson earned a career-high $650,000 purse.|$|E

2500|$|McCloy [...] "became very {{dizzy and}} lightheaded. Some drifted off into what {{appeared}} to be a deep sleep, and one person sitting near me collapsed and fell off his bucket, not moving. It was clear that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to help him. The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God’s will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else. I have no idea how much time went by before I also passed out from the gas and smoke, awaiting rescue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moskvin {{lived in}} Nizhny Novgorod, the fifth {{largest city in}} Russia. Moskvin said he began {{wandering}} through cemeteries with friends when still a schoolboy. In particular, they visited the Krasnaya Etna Cemetery located in the Leninsky district of Nizhny Novgorod. In an article written shortly before his arrest, Moskvin explained {{his interest in the}} dead, attributing it to a childhood incident during which he witnessed a funeral procession for an eleven-year-old girl. Moskvin alleged that the participants forced him to kiss the dead girl's face, writing that [...] "an adult pushed my face down to the waxy forehead of the girl in an embroidered cap, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> but kiss her as ordered." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Torrance {{looked at}} her with a curious smile. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. Larry and the rabble are our masters now; but I will see her once before I go away. Is there any other thing--that would be a little easier--I could do to please you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E

There's a reason for that--I was in a very tight place once, left without money in a desolate {{settlement}} where there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> when Mr. Vane helped me. But perhaps that wouldn't interest you." ...|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> To cry out or {{to attempt}} to reason with him would only have drawn the mutineers' attention.

I swear that clear to the 'midship- house I heard the dragging age-lag of his feet. Then that ceased, and that was all.|$|E
5000|$|Plaschke {{states that}} by 2003 [...] "it {{was obvious to}} me...(and) Dodger {{management}} that...(he was) probably on steroids. We would even talk about it while watching their bulging, straining bodies from the dugout during batting practice. But the players would admit <b>nothing,</b> so there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write.". [...] Brown's temper tantrums, he notes, may have in fact been [...] "'roid rage." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{talks with}} Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the {{negotiations}} set off unrest in the colony.

60|$|But, {{what with}} {{brooding}} on Jeeves and brooding on Motty, I {{was in a}} pretty reduced sort of state. The more I examined the situation, the more blighted it became. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> If I slung Motty out, he would report to his mother, and she would {{pass it on to}} Aunt Agatha, and I didn't like to think what would happen then. Sooner or later, I should be wanting to go back to England, and I didn't want to get there and find Aunt Agatha waiting on the quay for me with a stuffed eelskin. There was absolutely nothing for it but to put the fellow up and make the best of it.|$|E

One of the ranchers said he'd make sure there were no beasts inside it, and {{the prisoner}} and the rest went along. They found Wilkins with some bones broken, and got him and the horses out between them. Then, when the place was burnt out, Sergeant Mackay rode up. I was homeless; but none of the ranchers would take me in. Somebody said he wasn't sorry, and I'd got my deserts. Believe it was the prisoner; but can't be certain. That's all I know except that before I turned in I saw all the lamps out and fixed up the stove. Am certain the fire didn't start from them.|$|E

At last, finding that I {{was not to be}} moved, she asked me to let her see the girl--she did not wish her daughters to see her. I declined, and that brought us to a deadlock. She {{informed}} me that there was nothing more to be said, but she couldn't help saying more, and asked me what I intended doing about it. Nothing, I answered; since she refused to countenance Fan, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> Not quite satisfied, she asked whether this disagreement between us would make any difference. I said that it would make {{all the difference in the}} world. She was angry at that, but got over it by the time my visit came to an end, and she asked me very sweetly when I was going to see her again. I laughed, and said that after she had turned me, quixotic ideas and all, out of her house, I could not very well return. It distressed her very much; for she knows that I am not all softness, that I can sometimes stick to a resolution.
