She was sold in 1960 and her ultimate fate is unknown.|$|R
60|$|Of waders and water-birds I {{was able}} to get only eleven kinds, and of these only three (including a rail {{confined}} to the damp summits of the islands) are new species. Considering the wandering habits of the gulls, I {{was surprised to find that}} the species inhabiting these islands is peculiar, but allied to one from the southern parts of South America. The far greater peculiarity of the land-birds, namely, twenty-five out of twenty-six being new species, or at least new races, compared with the waders and <b>web-footed</b> <b>birds,</b> is in accordance with the greater range which these latter orders have in all parts of the world. We shall hereafter see this law of aquatic forms, whether marine or fresh water, being less peculiar at any given point of the earth's surface than the terrestrial forms of the same classes, strikingly illustrated in the shells, and in a lesser degree in the insects of this archipelago.|$|R

6000|$|The {{polygamous}} Ruff (Machetes pugnax, fig. 37) is {{notorious for}} his extreme pugnacity; {{and in the}} spring, the males, which are considerably larger than the females, congregate day after day at a particular spot, where the females propose to lay their eggs. The fowlers discover these spots by the turf being trampled somewhat bare. Here they fight very much like game-cocks, seizing each other with their beaks and striking with their wings. The great ruff of feathers round the neck is then erected, and according to Col. Montagu “sweeps the ground as a shield to defend the more tender parts;” {{and this is the}} only instance known to me in the case of birds, of any structure serving as a shield. The ruff of feathers, however, from its varied and rich colours probably serves in chief part as an ornament. Like most pugnacious birds, they seem always ready to fight, and when closely confined often kill each other; but Montagu observed that their pugnacity becomes greater during the spring, when the long feathers on their necks are fully developed; and at this period the least movement by any one bird provokes a general battle.[65] Of the pugnacity of <b>web-footed</b> <b>birds,</b> two instances will suffice: in Guiana “bloody fights occur during the breeding-season between the males of the wild musk-duck (Cairina moschata); and where these fights have occurred the river is covered for some distance with feathers.”[66] Birds which seem ill-adapted for fighting engage in fierce conflicts; thus with the pelican the stronger males drive away the weaker ones, snapping with their huge beaks and giving heavy blows with their wings. Male snipes fight together, “tugging and pushing each other with their bills in the most curious manner imaginable.” Some few species are believed never to fight; this is the case, according to Audubon, with one of the woodpeckers of the United States (Picus auratus), although “the hens are followed by even half a dozen of their gay suitors.”[67] ...|$|R

60|$|The vocal {{organs of}} various <b>web-footed</b> and wading <b>birds</b> are {{extraordinarily}} complex, and differ {{to a certain}} extent in the two sexes. In some cases the trachea is convoluted, like a French horn, and is deeply embedded in the sternum. In the wild swan (Cygnus ferus) it is more deeply embedded in the adult male than in the female or young male. In the male Merganser the enlarged portion of the trachea is furnished with an additional pair of muscles.[103] But the meaning of these differences between the sexes of many Anatidæ is not at all understood; for the male is not always the more vociferous; thus with the common duck, the male hisses, whilst the female utters a loud quack.[104] In both sexes of one of the cranes (Grus virgo) the trachea penetrates the sternum, but presents “certain sexual modifications.” In the male of the black stork there is also a well-marked sexual difference in the length and curvature of the bronchi.[105] So that highly important structures have in these cases been modified according to sex.|$|R

"Since {{her coming}} to this Country, she has, by every method in her power, {{endeavored}} to gain the affections of the Nation: she applied herself with diligence to study their language; and speaks it at present, as the Russians tell me, in the greatest perfection. She has also succeeded in her other aim; for she is esteemed and beloved here in a high degree. Her person is very advantageous, and her manners very captivating. She has great knowledge of this Empire; and makes it her only study. She has parts; and Great-Chancellor [brute Bestuchef] tells me that nobody has more steadiness and resolution.
