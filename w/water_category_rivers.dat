In this exercise, {{significant differences in}} status classification among Member States are harmonized by comparing and, if necessary, adjusting the good status boundaries of the national assessment methods. Intercalibration is performed for rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters, focusing on selected types of water bodies (intercalibration types), anthropogenic pressures and Biological Quality Elements. Intercalibration exercises were carried out in Geographical Intercalibration Groups - larger geographical units including Member States with similar water body types - and followed the procedure described in the WFD Common Implementation Strategy Guidance document on the intercalibration process (European Commission, 2011). In a first phase, the intercalibration exercise started in 2003 and extended until 2008. The results from this exercise were agreed on by Member States and then published in a Commission Decision, consequently becoming legally binding (EC, 2008). A second intercalibration phase extended from 2009 to 2012, and {{the results from this}} exercise were agreed on by Member States and laid down in a new Commission Decision (EC, 2013) repealing the previous decision. Member States should apply the results of the intercalibration exercise to their national classification systems in order to set the boundaries between high and good status and between good and moderate status for all their national types. Annex 1 to this Decision sets out the results of the intercalibration exercise for which intercalibration is successfully achieved, within the limits of what is technically feasible at this point in time. The Technical report on the Water Framework Directive intercalibration describes in detail how the intercalibration exercise has been carried out for the water categories and biological quality elements included in that Annex. The Technical report is organized in volumes according to the <b>water</b> <b>category</b> (<b>rivers,</b> lakes, coastal and transitional waters), Biological Quality Element and Geographical Intercalibration group. This volume addresses the intercalibration of the cross-GIG phytobenthos ecological assessment methods. One of the key actions identified by the Water Framework Directive (WFD; 2000 / 60 /EC) is to develop ecological assessment tools and carry out a European intercalibration (IC) exercise. The aim of the Intercalibration is to ensure that the values assigned by each Member State to the good ecological class boundaries are consistent with the Directive?s generic description of these boundaries and comparable to the boundaries proposed by other MS. In total, 83 lake assessment methods were submitted for the 2 nd phase of the WFD intercalibration (2008 - 2012) and 62 intercalibrated and included in the EC Decision on Intercalibration (EC 2013). The intercalibration was carried out in the 13 Lake Geographical Intercalibration Groups according to the ecoregion and biological quality element.

30|$|Determination of {{salinity}} hazard is {{very important}} in irrigation water, as high salt content renders the soil saline. This also affects the salt intake capacity of the plants through the roots. Electrical conductivity (EC) is a measure of water capacity to convey electric current. It signifies the amount of total dissolved salts (TDS). Thus, in the present study, the salinity hazard was evaluated by EC and TDS, their amounts varied from 415 to 1475 μmhoscm− 1 and 246 – 916  ppm with an average value of 1, 057.5 μmhoscm− 1 and 661.5  ppm, respectively. Based on the classification of TDS as suggested by USSL (1954), most of the water samples (85  %) are classified as moderate <b>water</b> <b>category.</b> According to the EC grading standards as suggested by Wilcox (1955), most of the water samples (85  %) are classified as permissible <b>water</b> <b>category.</b> Therefore, the continuation use of this moderate saline water for irrigation in the long term may increase the salinity hazard in the soils of the studied area.|$|R
