5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow, and he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and <b>winterization</b> of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
25|$|The H-21 was {{originally}} developed by Piasecki as an Arctic rescue helicopter. The H-21 had <b>winterization</b> features permitting operation at temperatures {{as low as}} , and could be routinely maintained in severe cold weather environments.|$|E
25|$|It had a {{rear area}} {{where it could}} carry {{ammunition}}, since {{it could be used}} in ammunition dumps to carry ammunition around the dump. The M6 also was equipped with a <b>winterization</b> kit that included: an insulated battery box with a heating coil, a gasoline heater to heat the battery, and a petcock for the bottom of the fuel tank (for easy releasing of cold air and pressure from the gasoline tank).|$|E
25|$|Night fighter versions. A nacelle {{beneath the}} center-wing that housed radar {{equipment}} (F-82F's AN/APG28 and F-82G's SCR-720C18); automatic pilot; and a radar operator replacing the second pilot. When <b>winterization</b> {{was added to}} the F or G, it became an F-82H. Entered operational service in September 1948. One F-82G was accepted in fiscal year 1948 (February 1948), all other F-82s (F, G, and H models) in fiscal year 1949. The last F-82G and six winterized F-82Hs were received in March 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the changes were internal. While the module-based design of the engine room, pioneered by the SA-15 class ships, reduced the amount of working hours while building the ship, the piping was completely redesigned to reduce its overall length and make basic maintenance easier. The fifth auxiliary engine was also left out as it was rarely used in actual operation. <b>Winterization</b> was improved by installing heating elements in the double bottom tanks, improving the heating in other ballast water tanks and increasing ice strengthening {{in some parts of}} the hull.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} classes among the New Haven units noting some {{differences}} between the manufacture of each batch. The DER-1a (Diesel-Electric Road) units #0700#0709 had the original design with a mass of vents on the roof, while the DER-1b (#0710#0749) and DER-1c (#0750#0759) had the simplified <b>winterization</b> hatches instead. The New Haven DL-109s could be found hauling passenger trains {{during the day and}} freight trains at night. The class was rebuilt once, replacing the plywood sides, removing the decorative side windows in favor of a steel screen, and several other changes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} {{semester}} of 2015, University Officials stated that they are seeking options to renovate or replace Beaver Stadium in the next 10 years. Officials state {{that there is a}} recognized need in an upgrade in the facilities. The stadium remains antiquated, despite multiple expansions and the additions of luxury boxes and high-definition scoreboards. Outdated plumbing requires complete <b>winterization</b> each November. Elevators are small and sluggish while concourses are narrow. The stadium lacks concession options and still uses bleachers. The limitations prevent wider use of the venue; the university would like to expand the number of events held at Beaver Stadium, such as major concerts and a long-discussed potential hosting of the NHL Winter Classic. Many fans are opposed to replacing Beaver Stadium due to the history and tradition but many agree {{that there is a need}} for renovation.|$|E
25|$|Across the country, Victoria Day {{serves as}} the {{unofficial}} marker {{of the end of}} the winter social season, and thus the beginning of the summer social calendar. Banff, Alberta's Sunshine Village ends its lengthy ski season on Victoria Day and, likewise, it is during this long weekend that many summer businesses—such as parks, outdoor restaurants, bicycle rentals, city tour operators, etc.—will open. Victoria Day is also a mark of the beginning of the cottage season, when cottage owners may reverse the <b>winterization</b> of their property. Gardeners in Canada will similarly regard Victoria Day as the beginning of spring, as it falls at a time when one can be fairly certain that frost will not return until the next autumn. There is also a change in fashion: lighter-coloured summer clothing was traditionally worn from Victoria Day through until Labour Day.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} was rebuilt at the Sacramento General Shops as an SD7R in 1980 and renumbered to #1518, and {{was released}} for service on 2/5/80. In this rebuild, it lost its dual control stands, dual horns and <b>winterization</b> hatch.|$|E
50|$|In the New England area, many wealthy {{families}} living in cities during the 19th century had summer {{homes in the}} mountains. This was to flee the onset of yellow fever and other epidemics which often struck in the summer months, when city plumbing problems and stagnant horse manure in the streets caused a health hazard. <b>Winterization</b> would take place each Fall when the families returned to the cities (often when school started). In those days, <b>winterization</b> just referred to a lock-down of all movable parts as protection from winter storms. An {{example of such a}} summer home that needs to be winterized each fall is the scene of the movie On Golden Pond, which was filmed on Squam Lake.|$|E
5000|$|In {{emergency}} or disaster response situations, such as {{managed by}} the UNHCR, <b>winterization</b> activities include the distribution of items including blankets, quilts, kerosene, heating stoves, jerry cans, as well as thermal floor mats and insulation to make tents warmer and more resistant to harsh winter conditions.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, these summer {{mountain}} {{homes in}} turn were winterized to enable winter holidays, as {{the popularity of}} skiing in the mountains increased that of summer camping. In this sense, <b>winterization</b> refers to the addition of modern amenities such as heating and insulation, often entailing a complete rebuild of the cottage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winterization</b> of oil is {{a process}} of {{removing}} the higher melting point parts from oil like waxes or triglycerides by slowly cooling vegetable oils and felling saturated glycerides from the solvent.Used primarily for oils in salad dressings.Mainly applied in bioindustry. The most common oil that is winterized is rice bran oil which has a high content of waxes, fatty acids and lipids.|$|E
50|$|It had a {{rear area}} {{where it could}} carry {{ammunition}}, since {{it could be used}} in ammunition dumps to carry ammunition around the dump.

5000|$|Almost all {{corn oil}} is expeller-pressed, then solvent-extracted using hexane or {{2-methylpentane}} (isohexane). [...] The solvent is evaporated from the corn oil, recovered, and re-used. After extraction, the corn oil is then refined by degumming and/or alkali treatment, {{both of which}} remove phosphatides. Alkali treatment also neutralizes free fatty acids and removes color (bleaching). Final steps in refining include <b>winterization</b> (the removal of waxes), and deodorization by steam distillation of the oil at [...] under a high vacuum.|$|E

50|$|Modern IMR vessels {{concentrate}} on a bigger operational window, {{being able to}} operate in the harshest of weather conditions, including the arctic environment. Many new vessels have an ice class notation and carry <b>winterization</b> equipment. New vessels are designed to be more environmental friendly and energy efficient by reducing emissions, using less or alternative fuel (LNG) and noise reduction. Designers and operators focus on a comfortable environment for crewmembers. IMR vessels often have a gymnasium, a solarium, a movie theatre and a high-quality kitchen.|$|E
50|$|This elegant two-story brick Georgian Revival {{house was}} {{designed}} by R. Clipston Sturgis and built in 1922 for Harold Anthony, son of David M. Anthony, on land subdivided from a larger property purchased by the elder Anthony in 1883. It is rare in Swansea both as a brick house, and as one designed by a major architect. Unlike his father's house, which {{was intended as a}} summer property, Harold's was designed for year-round occupation, and started a trend of <b>winterization</b> of summer houses on Gardner's Neck.|$|E

50|$|In 2016, public {{buildings}} were rehabilitated as collective short- and mid-term shelters for 24,000 persons. For example, of the 90,000 people from east Aleppo registered by the UN, {{the vast majority}} live in houses, but 4,250 remain in the Jibreen collective shelter, as of January 2017. Shelter and <b>winterization</b> kits (light construction materials and tools and clothes, blankets, etc.) were distributed to 26,000 people, while 40,000 benefited from private building upgrades. Only since recently the situation allows for implementing more durable solutions: full, long-term rehabilitation of damaged houses to basic living conditions, light infrastructure repair and legal help.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the results and {{responses}} produced from the trials performed using the pre-production aircraft, Hunting Percival proceeded to develop and incorporate several different improvements upon the design. Amongst the changes made was an overall smoothening of the fuselage lines, hydraulic systems being substituted for pneumatic counterparts, and the addition of a dorsal fillet; the new model was designated as the Jet Provost T2. On 1 September 1955, the first Jet Provost T2 made its first flight. This variant was used only for development work; in addition to seeing use at Hullavington, three Jet Provost T2s were dispatched overseas for <b>winterization</b> trials in Scandinavia and a series of sales tours across Europe, Canada, the United States of America, and Latin America.|$|E
