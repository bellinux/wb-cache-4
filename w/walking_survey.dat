There were initially two varieties discovered, now called the Cordillera ground warbler (robsonius rabori) and the Bicol ground warbler (robsonius sorsogonensis). The latter was first observed in 1961. The physical distinctions between them are mainly different coloration and geographic range. Originally, they had been classified {{as a member of}} the Nathopera genus because it was believed they were closely related to southeast Asian Napothera blabbers. They were later lumped into the same species, but afterwards morphological evidence, behavioral observations, and the phylogeny of these birds led to their reclassification into a different genus, Robsonius, within the Timaliidae family. In 2013, a new species was discovered: the Sierra Madre ground warbler (robsonius thompsoni). There are two other subspecies of the ground warbler: mesoluzonica and another from the Camarines Sur.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Niger River Valley in the Republic of Benin is an archaeologically rich landscape, where {{hundreds}} of sites line the river’s tributaries. Before this doctoral research was conducted in the region, the landscape here was a terra-incognita. In order to archaeologically investigate the area, several methods were used consisting of a field <b>walking</b> <b>survey,</b> {{and the use of}} satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). An integration of these methods, which are commonly used in research out of Africa, showed the diverse nature of archaeology in this region. The field <b>walking</b> <b>survey</b> revealed the position of over 300 sites and around 50, 000 material culture artefacts, comprising of mainly ceramic vessel sherds. The field survey was undertaken over 45 days and covered a total area of 25 km 2 within four geographical zones in the study area. A comprehensive gazetteer was produced from the data collected. Remote sensing methods that manipulate multispectral satellite imagery were used to identify sites from the air, because the archaeology of this region is not visible from standard air photographs. The mapping of sites using GIS facilitated in establishing fundamental landscape patterns, which helped substantiate theories surrounding West African urbanism and human-environment interactions. The results conveyed that settlements in this region favour areas where water is available, mainly close to perennial and ephemeral fluvial systems. Furthermore, the archaeological sites identified display strong evidence of spatial clustering, which has been shown in other West African contexts to be indicative of early urbanisation...|$|E

Winter ticks occur throughout moose range south of 60 º N, but {{little is known}} about how habitat influences tick density in Minnesota. Adult female winter ticks drop off moose in the spring to lay eggs and larvae attach to moose in the fall. The habitat that a tick drops off into could increase or decrease either survival or reproduction. Moose select different cover types for foraging and for bedding. We used locations of moose wearing GPS collars to identify tick sampling locations. Moose GPS locations could be identified as either movement or bedding. Targeted sampling at moose GPS locations allowed us to evaluate flag and <b>walking</b> <b>surveys</b> for winter tick collection. Bed sites and movement paths were identified from the 2013 and 2014 spring tracks to assess the effect of moose behavior and habitat characteristics on tick density. Moose GPS locations had more ticks than random sites (p = 0. 001). Tick densities at moose sites were higher in 2013 (10. 8 ± 2. 9 ticks/m 2) than in 2014 (2. 8 ± 1. 2 ticks/m 2; p= 0. 0003). Ticks were found at 52 % of 2013 sites and at 27 % of 2014 sites. More movement paths than bed sites had ticks in 2013 (p = 0. 01), but tick densities were similar in bed sites (11. 2 ± 6. 3 ticks/m 2) and movement paths (10. 7 ± 7. 5 ticks/m 2). In both years, tick density was higher in areas with litter depths < 3 cm (p < 0. 06) and with canopy closures < 50 % (p < 0. 008). A high percentage of sites in lowland conifer, mixedwood, and regenerating forests had ticks present, but no upland conifer sites had ticks present (p = 0. 0001). Spring locations from GPS collared moose were converted to paths. These paths were areas where ticks would have dropped off of moose. We created paths of moose in the fall by connecting GPS locations. Fall paths were overlaid with spring movement paths to identify areas where moose could acquire ticks. Overlaps of the 2011 - 2012 spring and fall path accounted for 6 and 13 % (3. 1 ± 0. 4 ha and 2. 2 ± 0. 5 ha) of the paths. All moose overlapped with their own path in the fall for about 4 % of their spring paths (1. 1 ha). The greatest areas of overlap occurred in mixedwood and wet cover types (p = 0. 0002). Mixedwood and wet cover types, especially with open canopies and shallow litter depths, have the highest potential to produce high larval tick densities. Mixedwood and wet cover types also have the greatest area of overlap between spring and fall paths and could be the areas with the highest tick transfer. Tick densities estimated from <b>walking</b> <b>surveys</b> and tick densities estimated from flag surveys were similar (p= 0. 9). Walking surveys with chaps allowed us to identify the height of winter ticks on the vegetation. The largest clumps of ticks were found at 38. 2 ± 3. 4 cm, but ticks were found from 0 - 100 cm. When more ticks were collected with <b>walking</b> <b>surveys,</b> ticks were generally found below 66 cm.

40|$|Strong {{evidence}} for {{the health benefits of}} physical activity (PA) and low U. S. prevalence of PA has resulted in an increased focus on promoting moderate intensity PA such as walking. Dog owners represent 40 % of the population and may be a promising audience to increase population levels of physical activity. Therefore, understanding correlates of dog walking is crucial for designing effective PA interventions to encourage dog walking. For this dissertation, the researcher developed and tested the psychometric properties of a new instrument, the Dogs and <b>WalkinG</b> <b>Survey</b> (DAWGS), which assesses social cognitive factors related to dog walking. In addition to the DAWGS items, environmental correlates of dog walking were examined. Dog owners (N = 431) completed the Dogs and <b>WalkinG</b> <b>Survey</b> (Mage = 43. 6 ± 12. 3 years). Using logistic regression, linear regression, and structural equation modeling, individual, intrapersonal, and environmental correlates of dog walking status and weekly minutes of dog walking were examined. The association of dog walking with overall PA was also examined with linear and logistic regression. ^ In the first study, DAWGS items demonstrated moderate test-retest reliability. Results also supported the factorial validity and invariance of DAWGS scales. In the second study it was found that self-efficacy for dog walking, dog-related outcome expectancies, family and dog social support, and neighborhood walking environment were positively associated with being a dog walker. Adult dog walkers {{were significantly more likely to}} meet PA guidelines than non-dog walkers (60. 6 % and 36. 7 %, respectively). Every 30 minute increase in dog walking was associated with a 24 % greater odds of meeting PA guidelines by walking. In conclusion, current findings demonstrate that the DAWGS is a psychometrically sound tool to assess SCT constructs that may influence dog walking behaviors. In addition, multilevel factors consistent with a social ecological framework were positively associated with dog walking. Individuals are more likely to meet PA guidelines if they walk their dog(s) and engage in dog walking for longer duration. ...|$|E

The sampling techniques we experimented with consist of a multi-scale sampling plot developed in plant ecology {{and the use of}} a nested-intensity survey design. We present results from the initial application of these methods. The sampling technique we borrowed from plant ecology is the Modified-Whittaker multiscale sampling plot, which gathers observations at the spatial scales of 1 sq m, 10 sq m, 100 sq m, and 1000 sq m. Nested-intensity surveys gather observations on the same sample units at multiple resolutions. We compare the results of a closely-spaced <b>walking</b> <b>survey,</b> a crawling survey, and a test excavation to a depth of 10 cm. These techniques were applied to ten 20 × 50 m survey plots distributed over an area of 418 ha near the Hudson-Meng Bison Bonebed in NW Nebraska.

40|$|Riparian buffers in {{agricultural}} landscapes {{should be designed}} to trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough that concentrates overland flow. This study examines the occurrence of concentrated flow paths (CFPs) in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at ten field sites in southern Illinois. To assess the prevalence of CFPs at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for <b>walking</b> stream <b>surveys</b> along randomly selected 1, 000 m reaches. CFPs were identified in all topographic <b>surveys</b> and all <b>walking</b> stream <b>surveys.</b> Among field sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82. 5 – 100 % of the drainage leaving the agricultural fields. Sediment berm accumulation was identified at all field sites and {{was positively correlated with}} CFP size. At the watershed scale, CFPs were more abundant {{in agricultural}} areas compared to forested land. Results from this study indicate that concentrated flow was prevalent across all study sites at both the field and watershed scale. Thus, surface water quality may suffer in areas with poorly functioning buffers, and managers must consider the occurrence of CFPs when designing and maintaining riparian buffers to protect stream water quality...|$|R

Two research methods were utilised. The first explores locational and social factors influencing dog walkers’ behaviour in picking up and disposing of dog faeces. Dog waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in Lancashire. Secondly, the results were used to deliver an online national dog <b>walking</b> <b>survey.</b> Results of the audits suggested that availability of bins, path morphology, visibility, and path location are key factors in determining the occurrence of dog faeces. In the survey a key factor influencing behaviour was the belief that clearing up after dogs is the “right thing to do” and this was associated with an awareness of health risks. Typologies of dog walker are also proposed heuristically, ranging from those dog walkers that are ‘proud to pick up’ who will pick up in any location, through those who make contextual judgements about where and when it could be permissible to leave dog waste, to the ‘disengaged’ who will not pick up {{even if they are}} aware of the health and environmental consequences.

ResultsCommunity themes from the photovoice session were access to healthy food, restaurants, and prepared foods; food assistance programs; exercise facilities; and church. 20 Asset mapping identified 114 community assets including 22 food stores, 22 restaurants, and 5 exercise facilities. 20 Each diabetes hot spot contained at least 1 food store with 5 to 9 varieties of fruits and vegetables. 20 Only 1 of the exercise facilities had signage regarding hours or services. 20 Memberships ranged from free to 9. 95 per month. 20 Overall, these findings were inconsistent with participants 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 reports in the photovoice group. ConclusionWe identified a mismatch between perceptions of community assets and built environment and the objective reality of that environment. Incorporating photovoice and community asset mapping into a community-based diabetes intervention may bring awareness to underused neighborhood resources that can help people control their diabetes. 27513998 PMC 499311...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the {{calibration}} of a backpack radiation detection system (BPRDS) for evaluation of the external dose to a person staying in an environment contaminated by 137 Cs. A commercially available portable gamma-ray spectrometer-dosemeter based on a NaI(Tl) detector was used. By means of information in the pulse-height distribution, it has been possible to separate the technogenic and natural components of the ambient dose equivalent rate, H˙∗(10), (ADER). In situ measurements were made in the Bryansk region (Russia) and Gomel region (Belarus) in 2015 – 2016. Both regions had been severely contaminated by 137 Cs due to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. Background measurements were performed at those regions of Russia that received negligible amounts of Chernobyl fallout. Measurements were made inside and outside settlements at typical outdoor locations: street, yard, arable land, undisturbed grassland and forest. The ADER in the pack-back geometry for an operator with a body mass of about 70 kg and a height of 170 cm was 12 % lower than the ADER registered in the standard measurement geometry with the detector placed on a tripod at a height of 1 m above ground. The attenuation of the primary 662 keV photons from 137 Cs in the operator was measured as a 22 % reduction of ADER. Much smaller effect, on average 3 – 4 % reduction, was observed with respect to ADER due to scattered photons from 137 Cs in the environment. The BPRDS and calibration factors have been used during <b>walking</b> <b>surveys</b> in two Russian settlements with 137 Cs ground deposition densities in 1986 of about 80 kBq m− 2 (village of Zatishie) and 700 kBq m− 2 (town of Novozybkov). The ADER due to natural terrestrial radionuclides and 137 Cs were in the ranges 15 – 50 nSv h− 1 and 14 – 500 nSv h− 1, respectively. The man-made source dominates total ADER in forests, while contribution from the natural sources prevails in the ADER recorded above paved areas...|$|R
