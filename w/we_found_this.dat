Joel McIver stated: [...] "Soundgarden are one of the bands I've heard closest to the original Sabbath sound." [...] Soundgarden, like other early grunge bands, were also influenced by British post-punk bands such as Gang of Four and Bauhaus which were popular in the early 1980s Seattle scene. Cornell himself said: [...] "When Soundgarden formed we were post-punk – pretty quirky. Then somehow <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>this</b> neo-Sabbath psychedelic rock that fitted well with who we were." [...] Thayil described the band's sound as a [...] "Sabbath-influenced punk".|$|E

2500|$|On March 5, 2004, NASA {{announced}} that Spirit had found hints of water history on Mars {{in a rock}} dubbed [...] "Humphrey". Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, reported during a NASA press conference: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>this</b> rock on Earth, we would {{say it is a}} volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it." [...] In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover Opportunity, this one was formed from magma and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.|$|E

During the performance, the singer ripped open her top to expose a black bra underneath, and became highly controversial in the media for its provocative nature, considered to usher in [...] "a new age of sexual spontaneity." [...] It was viewed as the first [...] "shocking" [...] performance of her career due to Jackson having a virginal teenage image, in addition to the portrayal of female sexuality considered taboo at the time. MTV News explained halfway through her performance, Jackson [...] "Although this was no wardrobe malfunction, it was a nonetheless shocking move." [...] It was ranked among [...] "10 Amazing, Shocking Unscripted Moments From ’90s MTV," [...] saying [...] "Janet Jackson ushered in a new age of sexual spontaneity on live television [...] It seems tame now, but it was just the beginning of the more sexualized image she took on in the ’90s." [...] VH1 also called it a [...] "fiery rendition." [...] Regarding the performance, Jackson explained, [...] "In the concert, I normally open up my blouse, but for the MTV Awards <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>this</b> really neat top that had snaps instead of buttons.

Duff has described [...] "Fly" [...] as [...] "an uplifting song" [...] about [...] "how people are scared to open up and show who they are inside because they're afraid of what others are going to say". Her character performs [...] "Someone's Watching over Me" [...] at the film's climax and [...] "Jericho" [...] during the end credits, with the other characters performing the instruments. The album's release in Japan includes three bonus tracks: an acoustic version of [...] "Who's That Girl?", a cover of The Go-Go's' [...] "Our Lips Are Sealed" [...] recorded with Haylie for the soundtrack to Duff's film A Cinderella Story ("We really wanted to work together, and my label knew that, so <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>this</b> song and we're like, 'Yes!

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detailed}} current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of resistance switching in NiO thin films. In unipolar resistance switching, {{it is commonly}} believed that conducting filaments will rupture when NiO changes from a low resistance to a high resistance state. However, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> that <b>this</b> resistance switching can sometimes show abnormal behavior during voltage- and current-driven I-V measurements. We used the random circuit breaker network model to explain how abnormal switching behaviors could occur. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> that <b>this</b> resistance change can occur via a series of avalanche processes, where conducting filaments could be formed as well as ruptured.

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>this</b> guy {{that used to}} work in the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
