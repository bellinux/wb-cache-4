50|$|There {{are four}} sets of trikonasthanas (Trines).

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
