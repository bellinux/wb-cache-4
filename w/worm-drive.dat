50|$|These {{sprayers}} have a <b>worm-drive</b> pump like Utiform Quattro or Master that pumps {{the plaster}} up to a spray gun {{that has a}} large nozzle, usually 4 to 8 mm, that extrudes the plaster into a chamber {{on the end of}} the gun. In this chamber, compressed air is introduced to blast the plaster into a spray. <b>Worm-drive</b> pumps have a rubber stator which is not compatible with solvent-based materials.|$|E

50|$|The saw can be {{designed}} for the blade to mount directly to the motor's driveshaft known colloquially as a sidewinder, or be driven indirectly by a perpendicularly mounted motor via worm gears, garnering considerably higher torque called a <b>worm-drive</b> saw.|$|E
50|$|A plastic {{filament}} {{or metal}} wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which {{can turn the}} flow on and off. There is typically a <b>worm-drive</b> that pushes the filament into the nozzle at a controlled rate.|$|E

50|$|SKIL {{can trace}} its {{heritage}} to {{the invention of}} the circular saw by Edmond Michele in 1924, which {{led to the development of}} the SKILSAW circular saw Model 77 in 1937. Now referred to as “the saw that built America,” the Model 77 set the industry standard for handheld <b>worm-drive</b> circular saws which remains in production almost unchanged today. In an example of a genericized trademark, portable circular saws are often still called Skilsaws or Skil saws.|$|E
5000|$|In many countries, Jubilee Clips tend to {{be known}} almost {{exclusively}} by their brand name, but elsewhere (where the brand is not so well known for example), they are known by generic names such as <b>worm-drive</b> hose clip or hose clamp or hose clip. The Jubilee Clip dominated the market {{to the point where}} the brand name is often used instead of the generic term [...] "hose clamp", particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland and in some of the former British colonies. It remains the term used in everyday speech in the UK and Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Nash's slogan {{from the}} late 1920s and 1930s was [...] "Give the {{customer}} more than he has paid for" [...] and the cars lived up to it. Innovations included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930. The 1932 Ambassador Eight had synchromesh transmissions and free wheeling, automatic centralized chassis lubrication, a <b>worm-drive</b> rear end, and its suspension was adjustable inside the car. A long-time proponent of automotive safety, Nash was among the early mid- and low-priced cars to offer four-wheel brakes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>worm-drive</b> {{portable}} {{circular saw}} {{was invented in}} 1923 by Edmond Michel. In 1924 Michel formed a partnership with Joseph Sullivan, and together they started the Michel Electric Handsaw Company, with {{the sole purpose of}} manufacturing and marketing the saw invented by Michel. The company later renamed itself Skilsaw Inc., which today is a subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH. Portable circular saws are often still called Skilsaws or Skil saws. Its successor is still sold by Skil as the model 77. To get around the Skil patents, Art Emmons of Porter-Cable invented the direct-drive sidewinder saw in 1928. Recently smaller cordless circular saws with rechargeable batteries have become popular.|$|E
5000|$|In 1934 Sentinel {{launched}} a new and advanced steamer - the S type which had a single-acting 4-cylinder underfloor engine with longitudinal crankshaft and an overhead <b>worm-drive</b> axle. Their Sentinel Waggon Works' design of 1935 led {{to the production of}} 3,750 Sentinel 'Standards' in the seventeen years that followed, the biggest selling steam lorry ever. It was lighter and featured a modernised driver's cab with a set-back boiler and was available in four, six and eight-wheel form, designated S4, S6 and S8. In spite of its sophisticated design, however, it could not compete with contemporary diesel trucks for all-round convenience and payload capacity, and was phased out in the late 1930s. It was not the end of Sentinel's involvement with steam, however; the company built about 100 [...] "S" [...] type vehicles for export to Argentina as late as 1950, for use by the Río Turbio coal mine. It has been stated that Sentinel were never paid for the last batch of the Río Turbio production run. At least two of the Río Turbio waggons survive in Argentina to this day.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{rationalize}} {{the design of}} the <b>worm-drive,</b> the fuzzy reliability design method and robust design method were fully applied to develop the new model for fuzzy reliability optimization design of <b>worm-drive</b> with the minimum weight, minimum sliding-velocity, and minimum sensitivity as the objective function. The fuzzy optimization design result of the <b>worm-drive</b> was obtained by compiling MATLAB procedure. Compared with traditional design methods, the center distance was reduced by 33. 3 ％, the sliding speed is reduced by 10. 6 %. The life of the <b>worm-drive</b> was raised by 11. 5 ％,and the wear quantity of the <b>worm-drive</b> was decreased by 0. 1 ％after 100 hours ' running. Introduction. In order to raise the design rationality of machine product and avoid the existing problems of normal design, bin recent years, randomness of factor influencing product and fuzziness of limitation of product's losing efficiency {{are becoming more and more}} important. These design methods have become nowadays main means of improving the design level of products and ther...|$|E
30|$|Suprapatellar and {{anterior}} interval adhesions were simulated by consistently tightening adjustable <b>worm-drive</b> fasteners (1.25 -cm band-width) {{around the}} femur and tibia at {{the location of}} the respective suprapatellar pouch and anterior interval at each tested flexion angle. The fasteners were tightened to 1 in-lb. torque, such that the soft tissues were not over-constrained. As an experimental quality control step, a second “no adhesion” state was tested subsequent to the three adhesion states and compared with the first “no adhesion” state to confirm the fastener did not deform the tissue. Although fasteners do not perfectly re-create arthrofibrosis, extensive pilot testing confirmed adjustable <b>worm-drive</b> fasteners were the most reproducible biomechanical method for replicating intraarticular arthrofibrosis, especially when compared with other, less reproducible methods such as suture anchors. Furthermore, our experimental setup is analogous to a previously-validated knee arthrofibrosis model performed by Ahmad et al. 1998.|$|E
