2500|$|Many of {{the songs}} were {{composed}} over several years, both {{in the studio and}} on the road. Parker saved ideas using a voice recorder on his phone, and wrote many songs on a drum machine. Guitars are present in every song on Currents, but are used to accompany and answer other instruments. This was partially due to his gear being inaccessible: [...] "We'd finish one tour in say, Europe, go home for two weeks, and all our gear, including my guitars and pedals, would be on their way to South America." [...] He had a larger array of synthesizers at his home studio, which allowed them to become the prominent instrument. He said, [...] "It's really just whatever is sitting around <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song." [...] The album incorporates Parker's falsetto, as well as a vocoder.|$|E
2500|$|Shostakovich's {{plan was}} for a single-movement symphony, {{including}} a chorus and a requiem-like passage for a vocal soloist, with a text taken from the Psalms of David. With {{the help of his}} best friend, critic Ivan Sollertinsky, who was knowledgeable about the Bible, he selected excerpts from the Ninth Psalm. The idea of individual suffering became interwoven in Shostakovich's mind with the Lord God's vengeance for the taking of innocent blood (Verse 12, New King James Version). The theme not only conveyed his outrage over Stalin's oppression, but also may have inspired him to write the Seventh Symphony in the first place. [...] "I began writing it having been deeply moved by the Psalms of David; the symphony deals with more than that, but the Psalms were the impetus," [...] the composer said. [...] "David has some marvelous words on blood, that God takes revenge for blood, He doesn't forget the cries of victims, and so on. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Psalms, I become agitated." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 2, 2013, Hussle {{released}} two {{greatest hits}} compilation albums to iTunes, Nip Hussle the Great Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. On September 24, 2013, Nipsey Hussle and Karen Civil TV released the first trailer for the mixtape, featuring him driving around Crenshaw, Los Angeles, {{and talking about}} his upbringing in the city. On October 3, 2013, he released another second trailer for the mixtape, also revealing 1,000 hard copies of the mixtape would be sold for $100 each. He explained his decision to RapRadar saying, [...] "It’s 2013. Whether we accept it or not, buying music is a choice, not a requisite. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychology behind what makes me purchase an artists album, it’s always a form of reciprocation. Almost like a token of appreciation after I experience the product. The reason I chose to charge $100 dollars each copy and only start with 1000 units is because I tailor making my music {{for those who are}} listening. it's not about stepping outside of what I’m known for in hopes of new discovery. What that means less is fans that are better served. I'm more or less focused on fully serving the ones that have connected all ready. That being said its a value over volume thing. if I'm goin to offer a product made with no compromise or concession to the platforms (radio, A opinion, label bias) ect...ect..then the way we sale it has to change." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
