5|$|Gauguin {{asked that}} Oviri {{be placed on}} his grave, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to {{indicate}} that he saw the figure as his alter ego and the fox as changeable in its gender as he was (according to Mathews) and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality. A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering at the time from a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him.|$|E
5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|Isidore's Latin, {{replete with}} nonstandard Vulgar Latin, {{stands at the}} cusp of Latin and the local Romance {{language}} of Hispania. According to the prefatory letters, the work was composed {{at the urging of}} his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa, to whom Isidore, {{at the end of his}} life, sent his codex inemendatus ("unedited book"), <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have begun circulating before Braulio was able to revise and issue it with a dedication to the late Visigothic King Sisebut.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (<b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together {{for many years in}} Spain when in the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, the relationship of the picine genera has been largely clarified, and it was determined that the Antillean piculet is a surviving offshoot of proto-woodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of Picidae, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|While {{conventional}} English sonnet form {{described by}} Gascoigne {{is seen in}} Sonnet 86, the Petrarchan sonnet form, which requires a pause between the first eight lines and the last six lines is also evident. At the end of line eight Shakespeare uses a period to bring the sonnet to a stop, changing the sonnet's direction by moving away from rhetorical questions to a more decisive tone within the sestet, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to answer the distress of the octave.|$|E

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|After {{success with}} {{shooting}} down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, {{as well as}} interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages to also obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien be captured for interrogation. This also involves developing a specialized weapon capable of capturing a live alien, and constructing a facility in XCOM's subterranean base capable of safely holding a live alien prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory {{features}} in the ethics of many modern religions, including Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Christianity, {{as well as being}} a part of numerous older polytheistic religions. In ancient Athens, it was commonly held that moral truth was tied directly to divine commands, and religious piety was almost equivalent to morality. Although Christianity does not entail divine command theory, it is commonly associated with it. It can be a plausible theory to Christians because the traditional conception of God as the creator of the universe supports the idea that he created moral truths. The theory is supported by the Christian view that God is all-powerful because this implies that God creates moral truths, rather than moral truths existing independently of him, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> inconsistent with his omnipotence.|$|E

5|$|In Iron Age Britain around 700 BC, a {{settlement}} on the Head was established; also around this time, the headland {{was cut off}} from the mainland by the construction of two banks and ditches called the Double Dykes, similar to those found at Maiden Castle. The earthworks consisted of an inner bank three metres high, with a ditch three and a half metres deep. An outer ditch six metres wide and two metres in depth is now obscured due to wind-blown deposits of sand and a gradual silting process. These defences turned Hengistbury Head into a fortified settlement area <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have grown over succeeding centuries until it became an important port. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final site in a small chain of fortified earthworks, starting from Hambledon Hill, and also including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp.|$|E
5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, or at least not one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, {{it is also possible that}} Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.|$|E

5|$|Longchamp's {{ancestors}} {{originated in}} the village of Longchamps, Normandy, but he was born near the Norman village of Argenton. His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Hugh Nonant—one of Longchamp's opponents—declared that the elder Longchamp {{was the son of a}} peasant, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely, as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a knight's tenancy in Normandy. The family was originally of humble background, but rose through service to King Henry II. The elder Longchamp also held land in Herefordshire in England, including the manor of Wilton near Ross in Wales. Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the Lacy family. Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy, exiled by King William II in 1095 for rebellion.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} was teased in early in October 2014 on NZ radio and Fat Freddy's Drop released Slings and Arrows 17 October 2014. Starting with an 8-bit intro the song blossomed in {{to what they}} said was their most reggae track thus far. The subsequent album Bays was released the following year on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington where the majority of the album was written. Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in Wheels and Cortina Motors, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> like a true evolution, and more soulful moments in Makkan where Dallas already resides.|$|E
5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic sagas, in {{particular}} Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, claim that Sigurd, like Olaf's father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair {{in the male}} line. Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada's father, along with {{other parts of the}} Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada's lifetime) rather than historical reality. Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized that they actually evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, <b>which</b> <b>seems</b> to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E
