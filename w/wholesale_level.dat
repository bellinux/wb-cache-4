When given in terms of money, market size is often termed market value, but in a sense distinct from market value of individual products. For one and the same goods, there may be different (and generally increasing) market values at the production level, the <b>wholesale</b> <b>level</b> and the retail level. For example, the value of the global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was estimated by the United Nations to be US$13 billion at the production level, $94 billion at the <b>wholesale</b> <b>level</b> (taking seizures into account), and US$322 billion at the retail level (based on retail prices and taking seizures and other losses into account).|$|E

40|$|The {{established}} {{system of}} marketing potatoes in Sydney differs in many aspects from {{the methods of}} distributing other vegetables and fruit. An elaborate marketing system has grown up, comprising, {{in addition to the}} retail level, primary and secondary <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels.</b> This system is complemented by wholesalers in other States, so that, unlike the typical means of distributing other vegetables, where usually only one wholesaler (commission agent) is employed, in this case at least two, often three and sometimes even more <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels</b> are involved. In {{the first part of this}} article a demand relationship for potatoes is established with rather surprisingly high correlation coefficients on the <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels.</b> As could be expected, the elasticity of the curve increases as the potatoes move towards the consumer. From the calculated data, it would appear that when farmers increase the production of potatoes by 10 per cent the primary wholesale price declines by some 24 per cent. Provided that margins remain the same, this means that their gross income declines by roughly 16 per cent. Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impacts of {{alternative}} federal dairy policies on the U. S. dairy sector. In addition to the current dairy price support program, five alternatives are investigated: (1) immediate deregulation, (2) gradual deregulation, (3) target price-deficiency payment program without supply control, (4) target price-deficiency payment program with supply control, and (5) mandatory supply control. An econometric model of the national dairy industry is used to simulate quarterly equilibrium price and quantity values at the farm and <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels</b> for each policy over the period 1980 - 90. Consumers are better off under both immediate and gradual deregulation, {{as well as the}} target price-deficiency payment scenarios because prices are lower, enabling them to consume more dairy products.

The paper has taken a case of Onion ((Allium cepa L.) wholesale and retail markets in Tamil Nadu state, India. The paper used wholesale and retail prices data from secondary sources. The results show that high margin at retail and <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels</b> of prices points to possibility of distortion in prices which may lead to an asymmetric process in the vertical market. The speed and magnitude of price changes and also the type of asymmetry in the vertical market system has identified the presence of {{both positive and negative}} asymmetry. With respect to speed, where the markets have shown negative asymmetry, there is evidence of retail prices responding much faster to decrease in wholesale prices than to increases in wholesale prices.

40|$|Significant recent {{research}} has focused on the marriage of consumer preferences and engineering design in order to improve profitability. However, in many markets, the profitability of new products for manufacturers is also a significant function of the retail channel structure through which the new products reach the ultimate customer. At the crux of the issue is the fact that channel dominating retailers, like Home Depot, Toys R’ Us, Wal-Mart have significant power arising from their {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of sales revenue and have the ability to unilaterally control a manufacturer’s access to the customers. A product design methodology is proposed that accounts for this new and important power asymmetry. Manufacturer’s product success as defined by profit is affected by pricing at the retail and <b>wholesale</b> <b>levels</b> which in turn is dependent on the channel structure, i. e., retailer monopoly or duopoly. These channel structures are explored in this dissertation under an econometric or game theoretic framework and the results are shown to have important implications for designers.
