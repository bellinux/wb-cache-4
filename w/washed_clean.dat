25|$|On {{the night}} of October 6, 1998, Shepard met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyoming; the three men were in their early twenties. McKinney and Henderson decided to give Shepard a ride home. They {{subsequently}} drove the car to a remote, rural area, and proceeded to rob, pistol-whip, and torture Shepard, tie him to a fence, and leave him to die. Media reports often contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. It was reported that Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except {{where it had been}} partially <b>washed</b> <b>clean</b> by his tears. Both of the assailants' girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol {{at the time of the}} attack. McKinney and Henderson testified in court that they discovered Shepard's address and intended to steal from his home as well.|$|E
25|$|Before a miner {{could sell}} his ore {{he had to}} dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock {{in which it was}} {{embedded}} and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly <b>washed</b> <b>clean</b> of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a bucker or, in larger mines, on a crushing circle, where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a buddle or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.|$|E
500|$|... "One Child" [...] {{garnered}} a mixed {{to negative}} response from critics. Andy Gill for The Independent {{thought that the}} children's choir gave the song a [...] "Jackson 5-esque glutinous" [...] feel. A reviewer for Sputnikmusic described the song as a rewrite of [...] "Jesus Born on This Day", written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff for the singer's first Christmas album, Merry Christmas (1994). Mike Diver for BBC wrote that although the song is [...] "bogged down in sentiment", [...] "any unpleasantness in the mouth is soon <b>washed</b> <b>clean</b> {{by the arrival of}} that hit", while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration as [...] "gooey". Jack Foley of IndieLondon echoed Diver's observation about its sentiment, writing that the [...] "more serious songs" [...] on the album such as [...] "One Child", [...] "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" [...] and [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] are [...] "stifling" [...] and makes the album an [...] "endurance test". He continued with [...] "Hence, Auld Lang Syne, One Child and Oh Come All Ye Faithful literally make your skin crawl and howling for the nearest slice of Linkin Park to add some musical grit to your life." [...] The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak was critical of the song, describing it as a [...] "needless retelling" [...] of the birth of Jesus that does not add anything new or original to the story of his birth. He continued to write that he was not surprised at the outcome of the song as Carey is not a historian.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, New York's Brooklyn Public Library also {{banned the}} book due to [...] "bad word choice" [...] and Huck's having [...] "not only itched but scratched" [...] within the novel, which was {{considered}} obscene. When {{asked by a}} Brooklyn librarian about the situation, Twain sardonically replied: I am greatly troubled by what you say. I wrote 'Tom Sawyer' & 'Huck Finn' for adults exclusively, & it always distressed me when I find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them. The mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be <b>washed</b> <b>clean.</b> I know this by my own experience, & to this day I cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life, who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated Bible through before I was 15 years old.

2500|$|The court {{declared}} her innocent on 7 July 1456 by annulling her sentence. They {{declared that}} Joan had been tried {{as a result}} of 'false articles of accusation'. Those articles and Cauchon's sentence were to be torn out of a copy of the proceedings and burnt by the public executioner at Rouen. The Archbishop of Rheims read out the appellate court's verdict: [...] "In consideration of the request of the d'Arc family against the Bishop of Beauvais, the promoter of criminal proceedings, and the inquisitor of Rouen... in consideration of the facts.... We, in session of our court and having God only before our eyes, say, pronounce, decree and declare that the said trial and sentence (of condemnation) being tainted with fraud (dolus malus), calumny, iniquity and contradiction, and manifest errors of fact and of law... to have been and to be null, invalid, worthless, without effect and annihilated... We proclaim that Joan did not contract any taint of infamy and that she shall be and is <b>washed</b> <b>clean</b> of such".|$|E

The export trade is confined to the shores of the Mediterranean--Italy and Spain providing the two great foreign markets for pilchards. The home consumption, as regards Great Britain, is nothing, or next to nothing. Some variation takes place in the prices realized by the foreign trade--their average, wholesale, is stated to be about fifty shillings per hogshead.|$|E
