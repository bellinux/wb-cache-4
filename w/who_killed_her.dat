5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her</b> husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

25|$|Catherine's {{family history}} is delved into {{in this first}} season, as her mother's unsolved murder has preyed on her mind for nine years. Catherine {{witnessed}} her mother {{shot and killed by}} two hitmen who were then killed by Vincent. Catherine refused to believe the official police report that her mother's death was that of carjacking gone wrong since the men <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her</b> mother suddenly appeared and began shooting without saying a word, as well as that the two dead killers identities were never found in any police record, leading Catherine to believe that her mother's killing was that of a government conspiracy. It was later revealed that Catherine's mother worked for Muirfield, conducting the experiments, and ultimately helped turn Vincent into a beast. Catherine must deal with conflicted feelings of her mother's memory across this season, having been determined to solve her case for all this time. When Catherine watches her father get run over in the season finale, she then learns that, biologically, he was not her real father after all.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders has {{featured}} seven live broadcasts. For its 25th {{anniversary in}} February 2010, a live episode was broadcast in which Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) was revealed as Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) killer. Turner was told only 30minutes before the live episode {{and to maintain}} suspense, she whispers this revelation to former lover and current father-in-law, Max Branning, in the very final moments of the live show. Many other cast members only found {{out at the same}} time as the public, when the episode was broadcast. On 23 July 2012, a segment of that evening's episode was screened live as Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) carried the Olympic Flame around Walford in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In February 2015, for the soap's 30th anniversary, five episodes in a week featured live inserts throughout them. Episodes airing on Tuesday 17, Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 (which featured an hour long episode and a second episode) all featured at least one live insert. The show revealed that the killer of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was her younger brother, Bobby (Eliot Carrington), during the second episode on Thursday, after a ten month mystery regarding <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her.</b> In a flashback episode which revisited the night of the murder, Bobby was revealed to have killed his sister. The aftermath episode, which aired on Friday 20, was completely live and explained in detail Lucy's death. Carrington was told he was Lucy's killer on Monday 16, while Laurie Brett (who plays Bobby's adoptive mother, Jane) was informed in November, due to the character playing a huge role in the cover-up of Lucy's murder. Bywater only discovered Bobby was responsible for Lucy's death on the morning of Thursday, 19 November, several hours before they filmed the scenes revealing Bobby as Lucy's killer.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to {{the ones on the}} islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn as the one <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her</b> father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E

500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some men said Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her</b> husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return quietly to her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were right to say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|E
500|$|The idea {{of having}} Lisa fight the pterodactyl, named Myfanwy by the producers, made them laugh, and felt they had to include it. The line where Ianto calls Jack the [...] "biggest monster" [...] was {{intended}} to be cut out, but Chibnall decided to keep it because of its impact to the audience. The scene where the team lines up to execute Lisa towards the end was the first scene Chibnall had in mind for the episode, though in the first draft, it was Ianto <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her.</b> After the episode was written and filmed, Chibnall discovered two main plot holes in the story. The first is that he did not make clear that everything about Lisa, including the scene where she acted human was all part of her plan for her Cyberman-influence to take over, and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly. The second was Jack having a cut lip in the end, even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly. In the audio commentary for the episode, both Chibnall and actor Gareth David-Lloyd stated the reasoning behind the cut being there is because Jack's immortal powers would only deal with life-threatening wounds and not minor injuries.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} known use of impalement {{as a form}} {{of execution}} occurred in civilizations of the ancient Near East. For example, the Code of Hammurabi, promulgated about 1772 BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman <b>who</b> <b>killed</b> <b>her</b> husband for the sake of another man. In the late Isin/Larsa period, from about the same time, it seems that, in some city states, mere adultery on the wife's part (without murder of her husband mentioned) could be punished by impalement. From the royal archives of the city of Mari (at the Syrian-Iraqi border by the western bank of Euphrates), most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi, it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled. Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of Elam, a country lying directly east of Babylonia in present-day Iran, made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates. For acts of perceived great sacrilege, some individuals, in diverse cultures, have been impaled for their effrontery. For example, roughly 1200 BC, merchants of Ugarit express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town Sidon, due to some [...] "great sin" [...] committed against the patron deity of Sidon.|$|E

2500|$|Beloved is a 1987 {{novel by}} the American writer Toni Morrison.

Morrison had come across the story [...] "A Visit to the Slave Mother <b>who</b> <b>Killed</b> <b>Her</b> Child" [...] in an 1856 newspaper article published in the American Advocate and reproduced in The Black Book, a miscellaneous compilation of black history and culture that Morrison edited in 1974.|$|E
