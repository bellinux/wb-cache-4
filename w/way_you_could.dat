500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E
500|$|Biko never {{addressed}} {{questions of}} gender and sexism in his politics. The sexism was evident in many ways, according to Mamphela Ramphele, a BCM activist and doctor at the Zanempilo Clinic, including that women tended to be given responsibility for the cleaning and catering at functions. [...] "There was no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> think of Steve making {{a cup of tea}} or whatever for himself", another activist said. Feminism was viewed as irrelevant [...] "bra-burning". Surrounded by women who cared about him, Biko developed a reputation as a womaniser, something that Woods described as [...] "well earned". He displayed no racial prejudice, sleeping with both black and white women. At NUSAS, he and his friends competed to see who could have sex with the most female delegates. Responding to this behaviour, the NUSAS general secretary Sheila Lapinsky accused Biko of sexism, to which he responded: [...] "Don't worry about my sexism. What about your white racist friends in NUSAS?" [...] Sobukwe also admonished Biko for his womanising, believing that it set a bad example to other activists.|$|E

In a <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{musician}} Weldon [...] "Big Bill" [...] Lister, {{who performed}} in the Hadacol Caravan, [...] "The only <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get into that show was with a Hadacol boxtop, And believe me, we played to crowds of ten, twelve thousand people a night. Back in those days there wasn't many auditoriums that would hold that many people. We played ball parks, race tracks - you know anywhere where they had enough big bleachers to handle those kind of crowds." [...] The final show was on 17 September 1951. Paul Schrader wrote a script entitled Eight Scenes from the Life of Hank Wlliams, which {{has not yet been}} produced. It includes a sequence on his performances with the Hadacol Caravan.|$|E
2500|$|The shot clock {{received}} near-universal {{praise for}} {{its role in}} improving the style of play in the NBA. Coach and referee Charley Eckman said, [...] "Danny Biasone saved the NBA with the 24-second rule." [...] Boston Celtic all-star Bob Cousy said, [...] "Before the new rule, the last quarter could be deadly. The team in front would hold the ball indefinitely, and the only <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get it was by fouling somebody. In the meantime, nobody dared take a shot and the whole game slowed up. With the clock, we have constant action. I think it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to breathe and progress." [...] League president Maurice Podoloff called {{the adoption of the}} shot clock [...] "the most important event in the NBA." [...] The league itself states, [...] "Biasone's invention rescue the league." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cyberdreams {{brought in}} writer David Sears to {{collaborate}} with Harlan Ellison. Sears, formerly a writer and assistant editor for Compute! magazine, had never before worked on a video game. Though a long-time fan of Ellison and his work, Sears was initially nervous and somewhat skeptical at his assignment: [...] "...they said, 'No, it's I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, and I was like, 'What?'...At the time, in the game-development community, people said, 'Oh I love Ellison's stories, but there's no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> turn that into a game.' I thought, 'Wow, what have I gotten into?'" [...] One of the biggest initial challenges was taking a short story whose characters have very limited background story and character development, and fleshing it out into a full-length interactive narrative. A breakthrough came about when Sears asked Ellison the question, [...] "Why were these people saved? Why did AM decide to save them?" [...] This brought about the decision to split the game into five separate narratives, each following a particular character and exploring why they had been selected to be tortured. Sears spent several weeks at Ellison's house, where they worked to flesh out the characters and their backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|Strength {{played an}} {{important}} part in Hoad's game, as he often drove for winners rather than rallying and waiting for the right opportunity. Although he assaulted his opponents, he also had the skill to win the French Championships on the slower clay court. Hoad played right-handed and had a powerful serve and groundstrokes but his game lacked consistency. At times Hoad had difficulty maintaining concentration. According to Kramer, [...] "Hoad had the loosest game of any good kid I ever saw. There was absolutely no pattern to his game.... He was the only player I ever saw who could stand six or seven feet behind the baseline and snap the ball back hard, crosscourt. He'd try for winners off everything, off great serves, off tricky short balls, off low volleys. He hit hard overspin drives, and there was no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> ever get him to temporise on important points." [...] Kramer compares Hoad to another great player, Ellsworth Vines. [...] "Both were very strong guys. Both succeeded at a very young age.... Also, both were very lazy guys. Vines lost interest in tennis (for golf) before he was thirty, and Hoad never appeared to be very interested. Despite their great natural ability, neither put up the outstanding records that they were capable of. Unfortunately, the latter was largely true because both had physical problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E
2500|$|During her {{performance}} at the NCAA March Madness Music Festival, Rihanna expressed her disagreement with Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allows companies and individuals to use their religious beliefs as protection, in case of being accused of discrimination against LGBT people.

There are ten original compositions among which eight were written or co-written by Djangirov.
