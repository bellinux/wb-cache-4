40|$|Parasitic {{plants of}} the genus Striga (also known as <b>witchweeds)</b> are root hemiparasites that cause devastating losses in crop {{production}} in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Two {{of the most important}} species, S. hermonthica and S. asiatica, infect the staple cereal crops of SSA including maize, sorghum, millet and rice. These parasitic weeds represent the major biotic constraint to cereal crop production. They cause losses in yield of 40 - 100 % and negatively impact {{the quality of life of}} millions of the poorest subsistence farmers. Infection of crop plants by Striga causes severe stunting of the host plant, thinning of stems and in plants such as rice, suppression of tillering. In rice the number of tillers produced is very important as grain yield is often correlated with tiller number. At present the mechanisms underlying changes in the morphology and architecture of Striga-infected plants are not fully understood and the aim of this thesis was to investigate the potential role of plant growth regulators in the suppression of tillering and the stunting rice plants infected with S. hermonthica. In Chapter 2 a detailed analysis of the changes in growth and architecture of the susceptible rice cultivar IAC 165 following infection by S. hermonthica was carried out. This revealed that Striga-infected rice plants showed severe stunting, decreased biomass, increased root to shoot ratio, thinner stems and suppression of tillering. In addition, this study revealed, for the first time that the suppression of tillering in Striga-infected rice plants to an inhibition in the formation and outgrowth of lateral buds. In Chapter 3 the hypothesis that strigolactones are involved in the suppression of tillering in Striga-infected rice plants was investigated by analysing the effect of the parasite on the suppression of tillering in rice plants with altered concentrations of strigolactones (plant growth regulators involved in the regulation of branching in plants). Strigolactone concentration was modified by (a) the use of strigolactone mutants (d 10 - 1, a strigolactone biosynthestic mutant and d 3 - 1 a strigolactone signalling mutant) and (b) the application of a carotenoid biosynthetic inhibitor (fluridone) or a synthetic analogue of strigolactone (GR 24). These studies revealed a partial role for strigolactones in the inhibition of tillering. In addition, there was an increase in the expression of CCD 8 (encoding a strigolactone biosynthetic enzyme) in the leaf axils of S. hermonthica - infected plants, consistent with a role for strigolactones in the suppression of tillering. The effect of S. hermonthica on the biosynthesis of strigolactones in infected roots was also investigated using CCD 8 :GUS transgenic rice plants. These studies revealed increased expression of CCD 8 in cells of the vascular bundle as S. hermonthica penetrated into the root and initiated fusion of xylem vessels with its host, suggesting a role for strigolactones during the infection process In Chapter 4 the potential roles of multiple plant growth regulator pathways in the changes in plant morphology of rice plants infected with S. hermonthica were investigated by profiling changes in gene expression in the roots, stem and leaves of control and Striga-infected plants using Affymetrix microarrays. This is the first study to analyse whole genome expression in the whole plant simultaneously following infection by S. hermonthica. This study showed the profound impact of S. hermonthica on the regulation of auxin metabolic, signalling and transport pathways of infected plants, revealing the importance of this plant growth regulator in plant parasitism.

40|$|The root hemi-parasitic <b>witchweeds</b> Striga hermonthica and S. asiatica are {{considered}} the most important biotic constraint to cereal crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). These parasites infect the staple cereal crops (rice, maize, sorghum and millet) resulting in considerable yield losses. Control of these parasites is very difficult as the Striga seed bank is widespread and damage to the crop occurs long before the parasite emerges above ground. Resistant cultivars {{are considered}} to be an effective and affordable component of an integrated Striga management strategy but very few are available to farmers as sources of resistance to Striga are relatively scarce and {{little is known about the}} molecular genetic basis of resistance to this parasite. Rice is an economically important cereal crop in SSA that is mostly cultivated by resource-poor farmers. Both cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa (L.) and Oryza glaberrima (Steud.), are grown in Africa. To take advantage of superior traits from each species, AfricaRice Center and partners developed inter-specific rice cultivars called NERICA (NEw RICe for Africa) for rain-fed upland ecosystems. Because of their high yields, even on low nutrient soils where Striga spp. are prevalent, the NERICA cultivars have been widely adopted by farmers. Despite this, very little is known about their resistance to different species and ecotypes of Striga. The aims of this study are to determine how resistant and/or tolerant the upland NERICA cultivars are to different species and ecotypes of Striga under controlled environment and Striga-infested field conditions, to identify whether resistance is broad spectrum or specific to particular ecotypes of Striga and to characterize the phenotype of the resistance at a histological level. Finally using a Chromosome Segment Substitution Line (CSSL) population derived from a cross between an O. glaberrima cultivar MG 12 (donor parent) and an O. sativa cultivar Caiapo (recurrent parent), the genetic basis of post-attachment resistance to Striga is investigated. The NERICA rice cultivars showed different susceptibilities to both S. hermonthica and S. asiatica species under controlled environment conditions. Some cultivars showed good broad-spectrum resistance against several Striga ecotypes and species whilst others showed intermediate resistance or were very susceptible. In addition, some cultivars showed resistance to a particular ecotype of Striga but were susceptible to others. The phenotype of a resistant interaction was often characterized by necrosis at the host parasite interface and an inability of the parasite to penetrate the host root endodermis. In general, the most resistant NERICA cultivars grew better than the very susceptible cultivars although even a small number of parasites caused a reduction in above ground host biomass. There was however, genetic variation for tolerance to Striga (the ability to grow and yield well in the presence of Striga) amongst the NERICA cultivars. The NERICA cultivars were also grown in field trials at Kyela in Tanzania (under S. asiatica infestation) and at Mbita Point in Kenya (under S. hermonthica infestation) in 2010 and 2011 to determine the impact of environment on the expression of resistance. The resistance of the NERICA cultivars against S. hermonthica and S. asiatica, in the field, was broadly similar to that observed in the laboratory although there were some exceptions. These results allow us to recommend particular cultivars for Striga-infested regions but they also illustrate the necessity of understanding the genetic basis of resistance to different ecotypes of Striga for breeding of durable resistance (and pyramiding of appropriate resistance genes) in host cultivars adapted to different rice agro-ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa. Sixty four lines of an inter-specific CSSL population and the parent cultivars MG 12 and Caiapo were phenotyped for resistance to S. hermonthica. MG 12 showed good resistance to S. hermonthica whilst Caiapo was very susceptible. The CSSLs showed a range of susceptibility to the parasite, however, only two CSSLs showed the same strong resistance phenotype as MG 12.
