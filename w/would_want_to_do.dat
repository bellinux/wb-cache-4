25|$|When Dowler {{failed to}} return home, she was {{reported}} missing to the police at 7:00pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she could not think of a reason why she <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The Independent reported in 2011 that Dowler had, some time previously, written a mock leaving-home letter and notes showing she had been unhappy.|$|E

In an interview with The Times of India, Charan said, [...] "When I met Anil Kapoor some time back, he told me I will ask Boney Kapoor to remake Magadheera with you in Hindi. But I said I don't know if I <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the remake. Magadheera is a lovely film which can't be recreated." [...] The film was remade in Bengali as [...] in 2014; it was directed by Raj Chakraborty with Dev and Mimi Chakraborty playing the lead roles. The 2014 Kannada film Brahma, according to its director R. Chandru, was inspired by Magadheera but was not a remake.|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order to survive. We explored different ideas, {{and one of them}} was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E

[...] According to Yorke, Godrich [...] "didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something else.

Mudvayne's probably bigger now than it ever was. So, people want what they can't have." ...|$|E

The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

In the video, Badu is seen {{walking the streets}} of Dealey Plaza in Dallas, slowly stripping to the nude, before being shot by an unseen assassin. On her Twitter feed, she stated that the music video [...] "was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then ran like hell". Badu was inspired by indie rock duo Matt & Kim's video for the song [...] "Lessons Learned", viewing it as [...] "the bravest, most liberating thing I’ve ever seen two people do...

2500|$|Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton {{were mainly}} {{responsible}} for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand {{for all of these}} to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were [...] "at-odds": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more [...] "computery-sounding" [...] voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley [...] "sounded perfectly human" [...] due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered {{by the fact that the}} new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should [...] "go someplace" [...] and that since GLaDOS is [...] "kind of likeable in the first game" [...] and players [...] "enjoy being with her", they would utilize Wheatley as an [...] "other, external threat". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.|$|E

60|$|There is a {{difference}} between boys and men, but it is {{a difference}} of self-knowledge chiefly. A boy wants to do everything because he does not know he cannot; a man wants to do something because he knows he cannot do everything; a boy always fails, and a man sometimes succeeds because the man knows and the boy does not know. A man is better than a boy because he knows better; he has learned by experience that what is a harm to others is a greater harm to himself, and he would rather not do it. But a boy hardly knows what harm is, and he does it mostly without realizing that it hurts. He cannot invent anything, he can only imitate; and it is easier to imitate evil than good. You can imitate war, but {{how are you going to}} imitate peace? So a boy passes his leisure in contriving mischief. If you get another fellow to walk into a wasp's camp, you can see him jump and hear him howl, but if you do not, then nothing at all happens. If you set a dog to chase a cat up a tree, then something has been done; but if you do not set the dog on the cat, then the cat just lies in the sun and sleeps, and you lose your time. If a boy could find out some way of doing good, so that he could be active in it, very likely he <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good now and then; but as he cannot, he very seldom wants to do good.|$|E
