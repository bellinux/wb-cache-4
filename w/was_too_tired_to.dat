2500|$|Sperm whaling {{involved}} the above-named ships searching for sperm whales on certain [...] "grounds," [...] or areas where sperm whales {{were likely to}} be found, such as the [...] "Western" [...] Ground in the mid-North Atlantic or the [...] "Offshore" [...] Ground in the latitudes of 5–10 degrees south and 105–125 degrees west longitude. The whales were spotted from one of the several look-outs stationed at the mast-heads. When a whale was found, whaleboats would be lowered and a harpoon attached to a long line would be thrown into it. [...] The whale would then drag the boats until it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> resist, at which point the crew would lance it to death.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Vainio {{concentrated}} on 10,000 metres and ran 27:42.65 in Helsinki on 2 July. The World Championships 10,000 metres race {{ended in a}} farce. The {{first half of the}} race was slow, 5000 metres lap time being only 14:13.07. At 5800 metres, Paul Kipkoech changed pace and left other runners behind. Francesco Panetta, Salvatore Antibo and Vainio started their pursuit a little bit later and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently, Kipkoech was far ahead of the other runners and the officials decremented the lap table, which displays the remaining laps for the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps, started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their [...] "first finish", but Vainio <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> realize the situation. Vainio also competed in the Marathon, but after a fairly good start he did not finish. At the Track & Field News annual world ranking, Vainio was recognized as the seventh best runner in 10,000 metres.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Jones {{spiraled}} out of control. [...] Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot {{introduced him to}} cocaine before a show because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> perform. [...] The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. [...] During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. [...] He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. [...] Jones also began missing shows {{at an alarming rate}} and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. [...] In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. [...] Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call [...] "the Duck" [...] and [...] "the Old Man". [...] In his article [...] "The Devil In George Jones", Nick Tosches states, [...] "By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. [...] He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. [...] Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. [...] Upon his release in January 1980, {{the first thing he did}} was pick up a six-pack." ...|$|E

60|$|She fetched soft soap, and flannel, {{and a new}} {{scrubbing}} brush from the storeroom. But she <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.|$|E

6000|$|Gilbert did {{not seem}} {{inclined}} to hurry his sister as they came near Madame Belmarche's. He lingered, and presently said, 'Should you <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> come {{in here for a}} moment? it was an intolerable shame that none of them were asked.' ...|$|R
60|$|But they <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> <b>to</b> go back at once, {{and spent}} a good hour near the beach. Close at hand was a tiny spring, and here they {{procured}} {{a drink of water}} and took a wash-up, after which they felt somewhat better.|$|R
