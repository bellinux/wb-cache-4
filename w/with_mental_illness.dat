5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> were widely known.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop {{evidence}} based recommendations for best practice in nursing care of patients <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> in the emergency department. It is estimated that one in about every four individuals in the United States has been diagnosed <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> (National Alliance on <b>Mental</b> <b>Illness,</b> 2013). Additionally, {{it is estimated that}} one in every eight emergency department visits will be related to patients <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> or substance abuse (Manton, 2013). However, studies suggest that staff members do not feel comfortable caring for patients <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> and many staff members hold biases against patients <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> (Manton, 2013). Therefore, this thesis proposes a best practice protocol the better educate staff members on providing appropriate care to patients <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> in the emergency department.

25|$|To {{prevent the}} {{recidivism}} of individuals <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> {{a variety of}} programs are in place {{that are based on}} criminal justice or mental health intervention models.

Programs modeled after mental health interventions include forensic assertive community treatment and forensic intensive case management.
