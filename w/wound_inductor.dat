The essence of innovation is to replace the source of of magnetic induction flow that pervades {{the core of the}} coil. According to the theory of electrodynamics, current bias, in contrast to conduction current, generated no movement of charge along the wire, but the change of the charge in the local volume. Equivalence bias current and conduction current is manifested in {{the possibility of}} forming a magnetic field. The flow through magnetic induction coil core regardless of the current it generates, creates voltage at its ends. The paper also shows the numeric characteristics that determine the effective frequency range, specified the reason why electric a wire with і < 10 can not generate magnetic flux through the core and serve as a passive reactive component. </p...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies {{is the quality of}} their resonators. [...] Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor, or just Q. [...] The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. [...] The resistance of conductors, especially in <b>wound</b> <b>inductors,</b> limits the Q of TEM resonators. [...] This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection. [...] The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q.|$|R

40|$|Inductor-based {{switching}} DC-DC converters {{are becoming}} increasingly important in the expanding world of batterypowered electronics. The driving advantage for this phenomenon is extended battery life, which results from high power efficiency. Switching noise, circuit complexity (i. e., silicon and board real estate, speed, and reliability), and integration of power passive devices, however, have limited their market penetration, especially when compared to linear low dropout (LDO) regulator topologies. Circuit designers, semiconductor manufacturers, and researchers are therefore working on reversing these trends, especially {{within the context of}} a single-chip solution, which is where power inductors and capacitors have the most impact. In tackling the integration of power inductors, both system-on-chip (SoC) and system-in-package (SiP) approaches conform well to a single-chip environment, but will they yield similar performance at comparable costs? The fact is discrete, SiP-compatible power inductor technologies are relatively more mature than their SoC counterparts. Companies are therefore starting to co-package commercially available <b>wound</b> <b>inductors</b> that are on the order of micro-Henries and no wider or longer and only slightly taller than conventional power management dies [1 - 2]. The issue that remains is the relative electrical-cost performance of SiP and SoC solutions, the answer of which is shaping the nature and extent of current research efforts in SiP and SoC technologies.

5|$|Today, it {{is often}} {{preferred}} to carry out filtering in the digital domain where complex algorithms are much easier to implement, but analogue filters do still find applications, especially for low-order simple filtering tasks and are often still the norm at higher frequencies where digital technology is still impractical, or at least, less cost effective. Wherever possible, and especially at low frequencies, analogue filters are now implemented in a filter topology which is active {{in order to avoid}} the <b>wound</b> components (i.e. <b>inductors,</b> transformers, etc.) required by passive topology.|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} class-C amplifiers a tuned load is invariably used. In {{one common}} arrangement the resistor {{shown in the}} circuit above is replaced with a parallel-tuned circuit consisting of an inductor and capacitor in parallel, whose components are chosen to resonate {{the frequency of the}} input signal. Power can be coupled to a load by transformer action with a secondary coil <b>wound</b> on the <b>inductor.</b> The average voltage at the collector is then equal to the supply voltage, and the signal voltage appearing across the tuned circuit varies from near zero to near twice the supply voltage during the RF cycle. The input circuit is biased so that the active element (e.g., transistor) conducts for {{only a fraction of the}} RF cycle, usually one third (120 degrees) or less.|$|R
50|$|In an <b>inductor</b> <b>wound</b> on a {{straight}} rod-shaped core, {{the magnetic field}} lines emerging {{from one end of}} the core must pass through the air to re-enter the core at the other end. This reduces the field, because much of the magnetic field path is in air rather than the higher permeability core material. A higher magnetic field and inductance can be achieved by forming the core in a closed magnetic circuit. The magnetic field lines form closed loops within the core without leaving the core material. The shape often used is a toroidal or doughnut-shaped ferrite core. Because of their symmetry, toroidal cores allow a minimum of the magnetic flux to escape outside the core (called leakage flux), so they radiate less electromagnetic interference than other shapes. Toroidal core coils are manufactured of various materials, primarily ferrite, powdered iron and laminated cores.|$|R
5000|$|A hybrid {{integrated}} circuit, HIC, hybrid microcircuit, {{or simply}} hybrid is a miniaturized electronic circuit constructed of individual devices, such as semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors and diodes) and passive components (e.g. resistors, inductors, transformers, and capacitors), bonded to a substrate or {{printed circuit board}} (PCB). If the components are on Printed Wiring Board (PWB) then, according {{to the definition of}} MIL-PRF-38534, it is not considered hybrid. A PCB can be called PWB if does not contain embedded components. Hybrid circuits are often encapsulated in epoxy, as shown in the photo. A hybrid circuit serves as a component on a PCB {{in the same way as}} a monolithic integrated circuit; the difference between the two types of devices is in how they are constructed and manufactured. The advantage of hybrid circuits is that components which cannot be included in a monolithic IC can be used, e.g., capacitors of large value, <b>wound</b> components, crystals, <b>inductors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Lead acid {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} in domestic, industrial and automotive applications. Even after lot of advancements in battery technologies, lead acid cells are still in use because of their high capacity and low cost. To use any battery effectively, first {{we should be able}} to identify the available capacity or State of Charge (SoC). There are many techniques available to measure SoC of a lead acid battery. One such unique method is to measure the capacity using eddy current sensors. This method is unique because it is non-obtrusive and online. Eddy current sensors (ECS) are wire <b>wound</b> <b>inductors</b> which work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Eddy currents are the currents generated on a conductive material when it is kept in a varying magnetic. Eddy current sensors generate varying magnetic eldest and will be able to identify the properties of conductive materials like thickness, conductivity, material composition etc. Also they can be used as proximity sensors. Lead acid batteries use lead metal as cathode. Upon usage(discharge) the lead metal converts to lead sulfate and revert back to lead after charging. These changes in lead electrode can be monitored using eddy current sensors. The impedance of an eddy current sensor will change when it is kept close to the lead electrode when the battery is charging or discharging. These impedance parameters can be monitored to determine the battery SoC. When lead is deposited on cathode, there will be more eddy current loss in the target and the total resistance of coil increases. On the other hand, when lead is deposited on the electrode because of increase in the magnitude of eddy currents which oppose the source magnetic, the total inductance of coil decreases. We can observe exactly opposite behaviour of coil resistance and inductance when the lead electrode is converted to less conductive lead sulfate. There is a lot of research on using ECS to measure SoC of lead acid batteries and there are still many challenges to be addressed. First we have explained about different circuit designs we have used to monitor the battery capacity using eddy current sensors. After that, we have explained about our complete experimental setup and the procedure to measure the sensor parameters using the setup. Then, we have discussed about different issues involved in the eddy current sensing based state of charge measurement. Eddy current sensors are affected by temperature variations. We have studied the coil resistance behaviour with temperature at different frequencies using simulations and experiments. We have obtained the conditions for linear variation of coil resistance with temperature. The measured temperature compensation scheme is applied and the results are discussed. We have also modified the measurement system design in order to minimize the lift o errors. We have used a metallic clamp structure to minimize the lift o errors. We have used finite element analysis based simulations to study different design parameters and their effect on the sensitivity of eddy current sensor. We have created 2 D eddy current models and the sensitivity of coil resistance is computed by changing the coil dimensions and the core permeability. We have also performed error analysis and computed the error due to the tilt angle shift between coil and electrode. We have also computed the error due to the internal heating of battery. We have also studied the effect of acid strati cation on state of charge for both sealed and hooded batteries. We have proposed a multi coil method to minimize the errors in SoC measurement due to acid strati cation for Flooded type batteries. We have used finite element analysis based simulations to compute the error due to acid strati cation by increasing the number of coils. Finally we have derived the equation for electrode Q factor using the transformer model of eddy current sensor. The derived Q factor equation is then used to study the aging of lead acid batteries both by using experiments and simulations. Finally we have explained a detail procedure to measure the state of charge(SoC) and state of health(SoH) of a hooded lead acid battery using eddy current sensing method...|$|R
40|$|Power {{inductors}} {{are widely}} used in many power electronic applications such as voltage regulator modules, DC-DC converters and battery power systems. Recently electronic industry advancement shows an increasing trend in usage of low cost high current helical <b>wound</b> planar power <b>inductors</b> also known as processed power inductors. The new trend and competition in electronic industry is initiating to design and manufacture power inductors in high volume in a short processing time. The quasi-planar winding technique gives compact size and rectangular cross section is giving low heat dissipation while reducing AC/DC resistance. The above significance and requirement tend to design custom made different rating inductors. There {{is a problem in}} these types of inductors, a inductance drop after reflow soldering process as mostly these inductors are surface mount device. This is happening due to inadequate gap between helical wound coil conductor and upper core inner surface. The inadequate gaps are not only causing inductance drop, beyond that core separation as well. Therefore formulating an iterative equation to calculate gap to minimize and control inductance drop during reflow and operation for different rated power inductors during design and manufacturing stages will give a prominent solutions for processed inductor designers and manufacturers. The methodology is mathematically model the reflow and operational thermal model and calculate thermal directional strain that to be analyzed with ANSYS thermal simulation. Geometrically different five inductor models are selected. The inductance readings are recorded at both pre and post reflow simulation to calculate variation. The influencing parameters are identified with respect to core geometry, copper volume and dimension, direct exposing area of material to the thermal load during reflow and operations conditions considered as well. The samples have arranged with respect to inductance drop in an increasing manner and identified parameters have plotted along with inductance drop to find trends lines. The trend line relationships are combined together to formulate equation with a constant. The equations have validated with samples...|$|R
