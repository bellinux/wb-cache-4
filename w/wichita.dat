5|$|As {{production}} of the B-47 came to an end, the <b>Wichita</b> factory was phased in for B-52D production, with Seattle responsible for 101 D-models and <b>Wichita</b> 69. Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built at Seattle and 58 at <b>Wichita,</b> and the B-52F (44 from Seattle and 45 from <b>Wichita).</b> For the B-52G, it was decided in 1957 to transfer all production to <b>Wichita,</b> which freed up Seattle for other tasks (in particular the {{production of}} airliners). Production ended in 1962 with the B-52H, with 742 aircraft built, plus the original two prototypes.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in <b>Wichita</b> County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many <b>Wichita</b> County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of <b>Wichita</b> Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, <b>Wichita</b> Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of <b>Wichita</b> County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|After passing exit 42, {{the turnpike}} curves away from US-81, turning {{northeast}} toward El Dorado and Emporia. It crosses the Arkansas River between Exits 42 and 45. Exit 45 (<b>Wichita,</b> K-15)) is a trumpet connection to K-15 in southern <b>Wichita.</b> It opened in 1956 {{as one of}} the original interchanges. As the highway continues northeast through <b>Wichita,</b> it comes to Exit 50 (East <b>Wichita),</b> a double-trumpet connection to the parallel Kellogg Avenue, which carries US-54 and US-400. It is one of the original 1956 interchanges. Exit 53, the final <b>Wichita</b> exit, is a trumpet connection to the K-96 freeway. The connector road junctions K-96 at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and ends at 127th Street East. The interchange opened c. 1994 along with the nearby piece of K-96.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wichita</b> {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, <b>Wichita</b> returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. <b>Wichita</b> then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. <b>Wichita</b> {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2.

5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways {{did not include a}} route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69.
