40|$|In {{the work}} there was {{presented}} results of investigations of <b>wetness</b> <b>coefficient</b> defined as ratio of water content in an any {{point of a}} basin to comparative point located on the Surface of a basin, carried out according to model proposed by Svetlitchnyi et al. (2003). The obtained research results were compared with the empirical ones carried out during various soil humidity periods AMC (Antedescent Moisture Conditions). Investigations were {{carried out in the}} Mątny stream basin, of area 1, 47 km 2, located between Gorce and Beskid Wyspowy. Comparative analysis showed very low fitting for the experimental results. Model proposed by Svetlitchnyi et. al. (2003) requires the analysis of influence of another factors oh distribution of this parameter on the area of a basin...|$|E
40|$|Field Biology of PlantsThe Michigan Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) {{is a tool}} used to {{evaluate}} the natural significance and floristic quality of a given locality. We evaluated the plant community at Orchis Fen, a 35 -acre preserve in Emmet County, Michigan owned by the Little Traverse Conservancy and Nature Conservancy. The purpose of our study was to use the Floristic Quality Index (FQI), Wetness Index, and the mean coefficient of conservatism (C) to provide the Little Traverse Conservancy and Nature Conservancy with information to aid in their preservation and management strategies. We set up a diagonal transect and identified plants across the site, passing through three interconnected habitats: cedar swamp, fen, and hardwood forest (Figure 1). We found that the mean C was 5. 14 for native species and 4. 42 when invasive species were taken into account. The FQI for native species was 53. 14 and 49. 60 including invasive species. The native <b>wetness</b> <b>coefficient</b> (W) was - 1. 96 for the entire transect and changed to - 1. 75 with adventives. These values indicate that Orchis Fen is a high quality natural area with an above-average representation of plant species associated with pre-settlement conditions. Our study reinforces the importance of continuing to focus on preservation efforts in this area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRoot zone soil {{moisture}} {{is a key}} variable in many land surface hydrology models. Often, however, there is a mismatch in the spatial scales at which models simulate {{soil moisture}} and at which soil moisture is observed. The limited spatial support of observations combined with the large spatial variability of the soil moisture field complicates model validation. The increased availability of detailed datasets on space-time variability of root-zone soil moisture allows for a posteriori analysis of the uncertainties in the relation between point-scale observations and the spatial mean. In this paper we analyze three comprehensive datasets from three different regions. We identify different strategies to select observation sites, and we present methods for quantifying the uncertainty {{that is associated with}} each strategy. In general there is a large correspondence between the different datasets with respect to the relative uncertainties for the different strategies. For all datasets, the uncertainty can be strongly reduced if some information is available that relates soil moisture at that site to the spatial mean. However this works best if the space-time dynamics of the soil moisture field are known. Selection of the site closest to the spatial mean on a single random date only leads to minor reduction of the uncertainty with respect to the spatial mean over seasonal timescales. Since soil moisture variability {{is the result of a}} complex interaction between soil, vegetation, and landscape characteristics, the soil moisture field will be correlated with some of these characteristics. Using available information, we show that the correlation with leaf area index or a <b>wetness</b> <b>coefficient</b> alone is insufficient to predict if a site is representative for the spatial mean soil moisture...|$|E

The results indicate that the coefficient values determined for USA conditions, which are widely used around the world, are not appropriated for the study area. The values found were also compared with the ones determined for Brazil and they also showed to be different. Pages: 5847 - 585...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} measure the gas rates and liquid rates of Type I and Type II wet gas flows is presented. The {{approach}} combines a differential pressure-based (DP) gas flow meter with a SONAR-based flow meter to provide two independent measurements of the wet gas mixtures, each with distinct and repeatable over-report characteristics due to wetness. The outputs of the two devices are then interpreted to provide gas rate and liquid rate of wet gas flows. Experiments were conducted to validate {{the ability of the}} combination of DP and SONAR meters to measure gas and liquid rates of wet gas flows. The over-report due to wetness of a 0. 6 beta ratio venturi (DP meter) and a clamp-on SONAR-based flow meter were characterized over a wide range of flow conditions broadly representative of oil and gas production and processing conditions. The experimentally determined over-report due to wetness of each was shown to be in good agreement with theoretical models predicting the over-report associated with well-mixed gas / liquid mixtures for each device. The ability of the combination of the DP and SONAR meters to determine gas and liquid flow rates was evaluated using experimentally determined <b>wetness</b> sensitivity <b>coefficients</b> to solve for the gas and liquid rates based on the outputs of the venturi and SONAR meters installed in series on a test loop. The combination was shown to accurately measure gas flow rates to within ~+/- 2 % and liquid rates to within +/- 10 % over a wide range of wet gas flows with gas oil ratios ranging less than 4000 scft/bbl to greater than 100, 000 scft/bbl. The results of these experiments suggest that the combination of a clamp-on SONAR-based flow meter and a differential pressure-based device is a viable means to provide both liquid and gas flow rates of type I and II wet gas flows...|$|R
40|$|Stemphylium blight is a defoliating {{fungal disease}} caused by Stemphylium botryosum. It {{has become more}} {{prevalent}} in Saskatchewan. Although not much {{is known about the}} biology of the fungus, increasing lentil (Lens culinaris) yield losses of up 62 % have been reported in Bangladesh and India. The infection of lentil by S. botryosum was investigated under a range of temperatures (5 to 30 °C), wetness periods (0 to 48 h) and wetness periods interrupted by dry periods of 6 to 24 h. The experiments involved testing the impact of environmental conditions on germination of conidia on glass slides and stemphylium blight infection on lentil (cv. CDC Milestone). Generalised linear models and non-parametric tests were used {{to determine the effects of}} these factors on conidial germination and disease development. Infection levels increased with increasing temperature and wetness duration. A latent period of 48 h was observed at 25 °C and 30 °C under continuous wetness. The duration of the latent period increased with decreasing temperatures and decreasing wetness duration. S. botryosum required warm temperatures (above 25 °C) and a minimum wetness period of 8 h for optimal disease development. Low levels of infection were observed within the first 2 h of incubation at 10 °C and increased with longer wetting periods up to 48 h and temperatures up to 30 °C. The pathogen could maintain infectivity during interrupted wetness periods despite its requirement for prolonged wetness periods. Infection levels were not significantly affected by interrupting dry periods of 6 to 24 h although long dry periods (24 h) combined with higher temperatures (30 °C) resulted in a decrease in stemphylium blight severity. Germination studies on glass slides supported these findings. Response surface models were developed that provided a good fit for the response of conidial germination to temperature and <b>wetness</b> duration. The <b>coefficients</b> of determination for the regression of observed against predicted effects ranged from 0. 88 to 0. 97. The general additive model could also be used to predict stemphylium blight severity responses to temperature and wetness duration (scaled deviance = 1. 04). However, that model tended to overestimate infection levels especially at lower temperatures. The coefficients of determination for the observed against predicted effects at 5 to 30 ºC ranged from 0. 77 to 0. 92 for the general additive model...|$|R
