5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E

40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} had atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia incorporating an AV bypass tract as the retrograde limb of the tachycardia circuit. High right atrial pacing during tachycardia dissociated the low septal right atrial electrogram {{in four of}} seven patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>free</b> wall bypass tract, neither of two patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right <b>free</b> wall bypass tract, four of six patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> posteroseptal bypass tract and both patients <b>with</b> <b>an</b> anteroseptal bypass tract. Pacing from the coronary sinus during tachycardia dissociated the atrial electrogram recorded at the os of the coronary sinus in no patient <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>free</b> wall bypass tract, both patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right <b>free</b> wall bypass tract, two patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> posteroseptal bypass tract and one patient <b>with</b> <b>an</b> anteroseptal bypass tract. These findings suggest two distinct inputs to the AV node, with the left-sided input {{being part of the}} tachycardia circuit in patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>free</b> wall bypass tract and the right-sided input being part of the tachycardia circuit in patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right <b>free</b> wall bypass tract. However, in some patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> septal bypass tract, neither the right- nor the left-sided atrial input appears to be a necessary link in the tachycardia circuit...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E

50|$|The Portuguese is an {{uncommon}} opening. In {{contrast to the}} Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5), by delaying Nf3, White leaves the f-pawn free to move and retains the possibility of playing f2-f4. The trade-off is that White's lack of pressure on e5 leaves Black <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>freer</b> hand.|$|R
5|$|Link also enters {{this mode}} when {{attacked}} by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> Fairy to refill his health.

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible <b>with,</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> and open sophisticated culture, which moderated hardline conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E

5|$|The rules {{had been}} in use since the {{establishment}} of the club. Although a selection of rules from public schools were seen there, the 1858 rules show little evidence of their influence. Many of the original members were from the local Collegiate School, which favoured the kicking style of the game, rather than handling the ball. The kicking game was also prevalent in the local villages of Penistone and Thurlstone. The rules were the first to penalise foul play <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> kick, introduce the throw-in and eliminate the offside rule. They also had the unique feature of preventing a goal being scored directly from a free kick or throw-in.|$|E
5|$|Though park keepers {{featured}} {{that the}} crowd would cause {{damage to the}} park, an official estimate suggested the cost was only around £100 (now £).

He praised the concertgoers, many of whom helped clear up after the concert and were awarded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> Stones LP if they returned a full sack.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E

During the team's first group stage match against Denmark, she scored her 110th international goal and served an assist to Julie Foudy as the U.S. won 3–0. Against Nigeria, Hamm's low free kick was knocked into the goal by a Nigerian midfielder. Within a minute, Hamm scored <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>free</b> kick. She later served an assist to Kristine Lilly before being substituted in the 57th minute. The U.S. won 7–1 and secured a berth in the quarter-finals. During the team's final group stage match, head coach Tony DiCicco rested a number of players, including Hamm, who was substituted at half-time. The U.S. defeated Korea 3–0 and finished Group A with nine points. In the quarter-finals, the U.S. defeated Germany 3–2. Playing Brazil in the semi-finals, Hamm was knocked down in the penalty area late in the second half; Michelle Akers converted the subsequent penalty and their team won 2–0.|$|E
