You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

[...] The action followed several days of rumours and a PC caucus meeting in which that party agreed to accept the Wildrose members. Smith said that several conversations with Prentice revealed that they shared much common ground, particularly on fiscal issues. Ultimately, she concluded that it made little sense for her to continue in opposition. [...] "If you’re {{going to be the}} official Opposition leader," [...] she said, [...] "you have to really want to take down the government and really take down the premier.

It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard, and is conveniently shortened to [...] "Stars on 45 Medley", or [...] "'Medley' by Stars on 45".

[...] In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the U.S., saying things like [...] "religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately." [...] Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's Iraq policy saying [...] "he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'" [...] Ellison staffers told reporters that [...] "the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war."

2500|$|In {{the first}} session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote [...] "Feed Your Love", a slow, soulful song which was {{eventually}} recorded and mastered for the album but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, [...] "C U Next Tuesday", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word [...] "cunt" [...] which {{is considered by many}} to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more uptempo, so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, [...] "Wannabe", which was recorded in under an hour—mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand. The next song they recorded was a slow ballad and the third track on and single from the album, [...] "2 Become 1". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session. [...] "Mama" [...] was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song's concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group's harmonies at the end of the song. In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Watkins commented about their first meeting, [...] "They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>work</b> with this." [...] A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on Tagg's Island near Chertsey, but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, [...] "When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic." [...] Watkins recalled, [...] "After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'." [...] It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, [...] "We listened to it and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is this going to work?".|$|E
