25|$|Identification of Soviet {{power with}} the Antichrist also {{decreased}} peasant support for the Soviet regime. Rumors about religious persecution spread mostly by word of mouth, but also through leaflets and proclamations. Priests preached that the Antichrist had come to place “the Devil’s mark” on the peasants. and that the Soviet state was promising the peasants a better life but was actually signing them up for Hell. Peasants feared that if they joined the collective farm they would be marked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of the Antichrist. They faced a choice between God and the Soviet collective farm. Choosing between salvation and damnation, peasants {{had no choice but}} to resist policies of the state. These rumors of the Soviet state as the Antichrist functioned to keep peasants from succumbing to the government. The attacks on religion and the Church affected women the most because they were upholders of religion within the villages.|$|E
500|$|Officials such as Governor Francis Bernard {{believed}} that common people acted only {{under the direction}} of agitators and blamed the violence on Adams. This interpretation was revived by scholars in the early 20th century, who viewed Adams as a master of propaganda who manipulated mobs into doing his bidding. For example, historian John C. Miller wrote in 1936 in what became the standard biography of Adams that Adams [...] "controlled" [...] Boston with his [...] "trained mob". Some modern scholars have argued that this interpretation is a myth, and that {{there is no evidence that}} Adams had anything to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act riots. After the fact, Adams did approve of the August 14 action because he saw no other legal options to resist what he viewed as an unconstitutional act by Parliament, but he condemned attacks on officials' homes as [...] "mobbish". According to the modern scholarly interpretation of Adams, he supported legal methods of resisting parliamentary taxation, such as petitions, boycotts, and nonviolent demonstrations, but he opposed mob violence which he saw as illegal, dangerous, and counter-productive.|$|E

2500|$|Other library {{bindings}} {{have been}} reported. A red library binding with yellow title {{and a simple}} geometric design in black, and including free-leaf maps, has been seen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> [...] "New Method Book Bindery", a company {{well known in the}} trade at the time (later becoming [...] "Bound to Stay Bound Books Inc." [...] ). This version probably would have been through arrangement with the publisher. Plain bindings, generally without maps, show up; these are presumed to have been one-off rebinds.|$|E
2500|$|Lucien Biva's family nicknamed him [...] "the anarchist", {{perhaps because}} he {{rejected}} {{part of the family}} pictorial legacy. In New York, when he exhibited at the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists, he was cited with other artists in the columns of New York Times (10 March 1922) as [...] "stamped all over <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of independence". It may be noted that the statement of the chronicler was somewhat tinged with irony. Since Society of Independent Artists created in 1916 was modeled after Société des Artistes Indépendants created in Paris in 1884, the author seems to have suggested this [...] "independent" [...] movement was already classical.|$|E
2500|$|Members of American colonial society {{argued the}} {{position}} of [...] "no taxation without representation", starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act Congress in 1765. They rejected {{the authority of the}} British Parliament to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the burning of the Gaspee in Rhode Island in 1772, followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a series of legislative acts which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up their own alternative government to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories.|$|E

60|$|There was a moment's intense silence until {{once more}} Dane rose up, {{and pointed to}} Courthorne sitting with half-closed eyes, dusty, partly dazed by indulgence, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of dissolute living on him, in his chair. Then he glanced at Winston's bronzed face, which showed quietly {{resolute}} {{at the bottom of}} the table.|$|E
60|$|The tramp of feet {{commenced}} again, {{but this}} time it was a horde of diverse nationality, Englishmen, Irishmen, Poles, and Finns, but all <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of toil, and many with that of scarcity upon them. Bedraggled, unkempt, dejected, eager with the cunning that comes of adversity, they flowed in, and Hetty Torrance's face grew pitiful as she watched them.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, {{a set of}} six stamps, each {{depicting}} one of {{the characters}} - Tintin and Snowy, Professor Calculus, Captain Haddock, Thomson and Thompson, Bianca Castafiore and Chang.

60|$|I {{did as he}} asked, {{beginning}} with the day when Jim showed me the passage in the Daily Occidental, and winding up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> album and the Chailly post-mark. It was a long business; and Carthew made it longer, for he was insatiable of details; and it had struck midnight on the old eight-day clock in the corner before I had made an end.|$|E
6000|$|And just as, {{summoning}} my courage, I {{was preparing}} {{to go down and}} do what, after all, I most wished to do in the world--viz., meet him--the wiry voice of St. Pierre replied glibly and falsely, [...] "Elle est au lit." [...] And he passed, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of vexation, into the corridor. There Madame Beck met, captured, chid, convoyed to the street-door, and finally dismissed him.|$|E
60|$|Weston's {{face flushed}} a little, {{but he said}} he would go; and the next day the party started up-river in two Indian canoes. Besides Weston and the dark-skinned Siwash packers, it {{consisted}} of four: a tall, elderly man called Kinnaird, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of a military training plain upon him; his little, quiet wife; his daughter, who was somewhat elaborately dressed; and Ida Stirling. Kinnaird and his daughter traveled in the larger canoe with the Indians and the camp gear, and Mrs. Kinnaird and Miss Stirling with Weston in the other.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning on 1 January 1868, the North German Postal Union (Norddeutscher Postbezirk) was {{responsible}} for the mail in Schleswig, Holstein, Lauenburg and Lübeck.

60|$|Yes, {{there they}} stand, and smile, and beckon, while ever more radiant grow their brows, {{and more to}} be desired the {{knowledge}} of their perfect majesty. There is no human passion like this passion for the dead; none so awful, none so holy, none so changeless.

60|$|Then {{the horse}} grew restless and pricked its ears, stood still snorting, and backed {{away to the}} length of its tether as a face looked out from the undergrowth. The sinking light of the fire was on it, and it was an evil face <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of hunger on it, and malevolence in the staring eyes. Again the horse snorted and trembled as an arm was thrust out of the bushes and {{something}} glinted in the hand, but Alton still lay motionless with the pack saddle under his shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} no {{sentiment}} {{in the face of}} Morris as he gazed upon the dead. Gnawing his nails, with introverted eyes, his brow marked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of tragic indignation and tragic intellectual effort, he stood there silent. Here was a last injustice; he had been robbed while he was an orphan at school, he had been lashed to a decadent leather business, he had been saddled with Miss Hazeltine, his cousin had been defrauding him of the tontine, and he had borne all this, we might almost say, with dignity, and now they had gone and killed his uncle! ...|$|E

60|$|He {{looked up}} at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamping</b> and {{shuffling}} of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully {{at the end of a}} shelf.|$|R
60|$|On that occasion, however, he {{contrived}} {{to scorch}} his heart {{with a double}} dose of jealousy, for he found two young men visiting the clergyman, each of whom {{seemed to be a}} friend of the family. One was a spendthrift named Rentworth--a young traveller of that loose, easy-going type which is occasionally met with in foreign parts, squandering the money of a rich father. He was a decidedly handsome young fellow, but <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of dissipation already on his countenance. The other was a telegraph engineer, with honesty and good-nature in every line of his plain countenance.|$|E
60|$|The various {{bedrooms}} and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a careful search. Apparently the tenants had brought {{little or nothing}} with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house. A good deal of clothing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of Marx and Co., High Holborn, had been left behind. Telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that Marx knew nothing of his customer save {{that he was a}} good payer. Odds and ends, some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, an old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a guitar were among the personal property.|$|E
60|$|On {{the night}} in {{question}} a full moon hung over the CaÃ±adas' splintered rampart, and its soft radiance fell upon the white-walled city and smote a track of glittering silver across the vast plain of sea. The smell of oleanders and heliotrope was heavy in the air, and a cluster of blossoms swayed above Jacinta's shoulder. She was just then looking up at a Spanish officer in dark green uniform, who stood close by, with sword girt tight to his thigh. He had a dark, forceful face, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>stamp</b> of distinction on it, but he received no encouragement, though {{he glanced at the}} vacant place on the stone bench suggestively.|$|E
