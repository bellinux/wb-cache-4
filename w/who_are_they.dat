500|$|A {{number of}} South African [...] "Freedom Songs" [...] had musical origins in makwaya, or choir music, which {{combined}} elements of Christian hymns with traditional South African musical forms. The songs were often short and repetitive, using a [...] "call-and-response" [...] structure. The music was primarily in indigenous languages such as Xhosa or Zulu, {{as well as}} in English. Melodies used in these songs were often very straightforward. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa—re-purposing them to represent their message of resistance to apartheid. This trend had begun decades previously when South African jazz musicians had added African elements to jazz music adapted from the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Voëlvry musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Groups affiliated with the Black Consciousness movement also began incorporating traditional material into their music: the jazz-fusion group Malombo, for example, used traditional rhythms of the Venda people to communicate pride in African culture, often with music that was not explicitly political. While musicians such as Makeba, performing outside South Africa, felt an obligation to write political lyrics, musicians within the country often held that there was no divide between revolutionary music and, for instance, love songs, because the struggle of living a normal life was also a political one. Vusi Mahlasela would write in 1991: [...] "So <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> who say no more love poems now? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child." ...|$|E

2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance. The Associated Press stated [...] "MTV's [...] "Spanking New" [...] videos in heavy rotation include a gyrating, cleavage-baring Beyoncé [...] and a bleeped-out Eminem with his group D12 [...] Yet the sedate new video from Janet Jackson—a fixture {{on the cable}} channel {{for almost two decades}} and its first [...] "MTV Icon"—has been absent from its playlist. Meanwhile, Jackson's name had barely been mentioned on MTV—unusual for a superstar whose previous projects have typically gotten heavy promotion." [...] Jackson's collaborator Jimmy Jam commented [...] "You can probably read between the lines with MTV." [...] "I would guess that if MTV wanted to play it, they would, but this is just speculation on my part. It certainly could raise a few questions if you have an investigative mind." [...] Jam also commented, [...] "It's tough to click with audiences when you don't get support from the major media outlets." [...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> trying to kid? Of course, MTV is a corporate cousin of CBS, where the original snafu happened. But that's just a coincidence!" ...|$|E

Two great white birds with red lights on them stood there on stilt-like legs, and the beach of the island was unmarked, save by the skeleton print of birds' feet.
