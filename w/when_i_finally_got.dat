500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to match point I went for a winner and I hit it. I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E

[...] "I've a notion that such prayers don't rise very far. I used to pray that I might be enabled to forgive a certain person, but I know now I really didn't want to forgive her. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> that I DID want to I forgave her without having to pray about it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The guitar solo was {{assembled}} in numerous takes at Criteria Studios by Ken Caillat, Fleetwood Mac's producer at the time. [...] "It {{was a completely}} comp'd solo, and on the 24-track it's still in its original form, with all the separate guitars, {{and you still have}} to mix that way. I remember, I'd gone away for Christmas vacation and got snowed in at Lake Tahoe, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> returned <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a midnight call telling me to come to the studio because they'd been trying to mix that song and couldn't build the guitar solo. So I drove there and did the solo, using mutes and faders while also having two solos play simultaneously for certain parts, such as one toward the end where he does this slide." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{was more}} than a year ago. I stayed there--waiting. Nothing was sure, except that the town grew like a mushroom. It filled with soldiers--and the worst crowd I ever saw. You can bet I was shaky <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> an {{audience}} with General Lodge and his staff. They had an office in a big storehouse. The place was full of men--soldiers and tramps. It struck me right off what a grim and discouraged bunch those engineers looked. I didn't understand them, but I do now.... Well, I asked for a job. Nobody appeared to hear me. It was hard to make yourself heard. I tried again--louder. An old engineer, whom I know now--Henney--waved me aside. Just as if a job was unheard of!" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{viewing the}} hall, as it still lacked {{something}} of ten, I continued my walk through that entanglement of city streets, and quickly found myself getting beyond my reckoning. I cannot tell whither I went, but I {{passed through a}} very dirty region, and I remember a long, narrow, evil-odored street, cluttered up with stalls, in which were vegetables and little bits of meat for sale; {{and there was a}} frowzy multitude of buyers and sellers. Still I blundered on, and was getting out of the density of the city into broader streets, but still shabby ones, when, looking at my watch, I found it to be past ten, and no cab-stand within sight. It was a quarter past <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> into one; and the driver told me that it would take half an hour to go from thence to Upper Brook Street; so that I was likely to exceed the license implied in Mr. Milnes's invitation. Whether I was quite beyond rule I cannot say; but it did not lack more than ten minutes of eleven when I was ushered up stairs, and I found all the company assembled. However, it is of little consequence, except that if I had come early, I should have been introduced to many of the guests, whom now I could only know across the table. Mrs. Milnes greeted me very kindly, and Mr. Milnes came towards me with an elderly gentleman in a blue coat and gray pantaloons,--with a long, rather thin, homely visage, exceedingly shaggy eyebrows, though no great weight of brow, and thin gray hair, and introduced me to the Marquis of Lansdowne. The Marquis had his right hand wrapped up in a black-silk handkerchief; so he gave me his left, and, from some awkwardness in meeting it, when I expected the right, I gave him only three of my fingers,--a thing I never did before to any person, and it is droll that I should have done it to a Marquis. He addressed me with great simplicity and natural kindness, complimenting me on my works, and speaking about the society of Liverpool in former days. Lord Lansdowne was the friend of Moore, and has about him the aroma communicated by the memories of many illustrious people with whom he has associated.|$|E

5000|$|Batten {{began to}} play guitar {{at the age of}} 8 when her father bought her a [...] "killer red and blue electric". In an interview, she said, [...] "People often want to know why I started. It was a two-parter. One part is seeing the Beatles on TV and my whole {{neighborhood}}, and I lived in this little tiny town in upstate New York, and the whole neighborhood was all about the Beatles. And, the other part is my sister had a guitar and I didn't and I was jealous. So, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> a guitar, it was electric, which way back then in the 60s it was odd for a kid, especially an eight year old, to get an electric for your first guitar.

Baker said in 1999 of his breakthrough work, I wrote Why I Hate Saturn {{at a time when}} comic books had stopped being fun for me. I was tired of being told how to draw and what to draw. And I was sick of begging people to let me work the way I wanted. Editors told me my stuff was 'underground' and 'alternative'. I decided that if I were going to work in a creatively oppressive atmosphere and not even be allowed to own my work, I might as well go to Hollywood and be oppressed for big money. Back in the eighties, DC and Marvel wouldn't let you own your characters, and Fantagraphics had no money.
