5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E

25|$|Many dowsers today use a pair {{of simple}} L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm {{pointing}} forward. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> found, the rods cross over one another making an X over the found object. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods are sometimes fashioned from wire coat hangers, and glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century New England.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to mixing, the substances {{in a solution}} {{interact with each other}} at the molecular level. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around molecules of the solute. Heat transfer is involved and entropy is increased making the solution more thermodynamically stable than the solute and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole moment and polarizability. Solvation does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the solute. However, solvation resembles a coordination complex formation reaction, often with considerable energetics (heat of solvation and entropy of solvation) and is thus far from a neutral process.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{producers}} are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC {{if they wish}} to do so. Thus, a wine from a Grand Cru vineyard may be sold as a Premier Cru from that vineyard's village, a Premier Cru wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a Grand Cru wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a Premier Cru at a lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold.|$|E

500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} excess {{pressure}} on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. [...] In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or intervertebral discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, {{studies have found that}} earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. [...] Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.|$|E
500|$|When the Æsir exclaimed {{that they}} were ready, Fenrir shook himself, knocked the fetter to the ground, {{strained}} hard, and kicking with his feet, snapped the fetter – breaking it into pieces that flew far into the distance.

The Æsir started to fear {{that they would not}} be able to bind Fenrir, and so Odin sent Freyr's messenger Skírnir down into the land of Svartálfaheimr to [...] "some dwarfs" [...] and had them make a fetter called Gleipnir. The dwarves constructed Gleipnir from six mythical ingredients. After an exchange between Gangleri and High, High continues that the fetter was smooth and soft as a silken ribbon, yet strong and firm.

500|$|... is {{the leader}} of Team 10 and son of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and uncle of Konohamaru Sarutobi. In battle, Asuma wields trench knives that he can infuse with his wind nature chakra to extend the blades' length and sharpness. When he was younger, Asuma had a dispute with his father and briefly left Konohagakure in protest, gaining fame {{as a member of the}} Land of Fire's Twelve Guardian Shinobi. Though Asuma {{eventually}} returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha's next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen's death. Asuma is usually seen smoking a cigarette, but will temporarily drop the habit <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> bothering him, such as when his father died. Among all his students, Asuma shares a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together. Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child. After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor's ideals as he uses his knuckles to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife. Asuma's voice actor in the Japanese anime is Jūrōta Kosugi, and he is voiced by Doug Erholtz in the English adaptation.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

[...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> actually happening on this show.

[...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
