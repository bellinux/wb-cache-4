Jack has to attend the meeting alone, but his idea for a fireworks special impresses the network and he successfully defends his job against Devon Banks. When the fireworks special actually airs, however, the fireworks are shot off in midtown New York outside Rockefeller Center and it ends up looking like a terrorist attack. Panic results and the mayor calls, causing the event to be unceremoniously ended.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{insistence that}} they would not let sex with each other affect their friendship, Zack and Miri soon develop romantic {{feelings}} for each other. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> for Zack and Miri to have sex on camera, they find that instead of the clinical sex enacted by the actors in the other scenes, their interlude is romantic and heartfelt. Later the next evening, Zack and Miri are at home tentatively about to discuss their reactions to the scene, when suddenly their apartment's electricity and water service return. The rest of the actors and crew reveal that they pooled their resources to pay one month of Zack and Miri's bills and are throwing them an early wrap party.|$|E

25|$|Played mid-credits, Amy (Elizabeth Banks) {{worries that}} her boyfriend Anson's (Josh Duhamel) cat, Beezel (an {{animated}} cartoon), is coming between their relationship. Beezel seems to detest Amy {{and anyone who}} comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees {{to find a new}} home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry humping a stuffed teddy bear). The next day <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel's motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about French kissing his owner.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robotsâ€” all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Swift revealed that [...] "Mine" [...] was inspired by an unnamed crush in mind, saying [...] "I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time." [...] She also told MTV that the song is {{about what it would}} be like if she actually let her guard down. During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out." ...|$|E

500|$|Lopez {{began working}} on a [...] "collection of songs" [...] in 2011, unaware {{of what she was}} [...] "going to do with them". At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit down and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences {{and the fact that the}} team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C+. Handlen criticized the episode's lack of resolution, noting that [...] "The show can feed our social {{paranoia}} [...] but <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> {{to deliver on}} all this, to finally pull back the curtain {{and move on to}} the next stage, it fumbles things." [...] Furthermore, he called the Mulder/Scully/Fowley love triangle [...] "immediately off-putting" [...] and criticized Mimi Rogers's characterization. However, Handlen did call The Smoking Man's return [...] "thrilling" [...] and wrote that the burning of Mulder's office was [...] "arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized the closing down of the X-Files division, due largely to the fact that [...] "we've seen [...] before", a reference to the divisions's closing at the conclusion of the show's first season. However, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'The End' works in spite of itself", citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as positive points in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Born This Way, season ten American Idol {{contestant}} Haley Reinhart sang [...] "You and I" [...] as one of two performances for the [...] "Songs from Now and Then" [...] episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star-Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart [...] "sounded amazing" [...] by hitting [...] "some really high notes". Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an [...] "old-fashioned dance-hall groove, kind of like a mid-'70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel-style rocker, and she takes it to the house." [...] Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judgesâ€”Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tylerâ€”reacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of [...] "You and I" [...] was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, feeling that if she could [...] "get another 10 songs this good <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to cut the record, then all my initial misgivings about this girl will vanish into thin air." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Connor foresaw a [...] "substantial {{constitutional}} tax" [...] {{in applying}} the Apprendi rule to sentencing guidelines systems. She protested {{that the traditional}} sentencing factors would now have to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury. Bifurcated proceedings may become commonplace in criminal trials, so that a jury might not improperly consider prior bad acts during the guilt phase but properly consider them <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> for sentencing. And under some guidelines schemes, such as the federal sentencing guidelines, some facts relevant to sentencing, such as perjury and obstruction of justice, cannot be known until the trial is underway. In any event, all relevant sentencing facts may not be known prior to trial, since prosecutors typically wait until after a guilty verdict is obtained before gathering a full history of the defendant and examining the pertinent facts of the crime in order to recommend a sentence.|$|E
2500|$|... {{determines the}} degree of {{polarity}} of the array, but for a neutral array {{it is simply a}} vector property of the array with no information about the array's absolute location. The dipole moment density of the array p(r) contains both the location of the array and its dipole moment. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to calculate the electric field in some region containing the array, Maxwell's equations are solved, and the information about the charge array is contained in the polarization density P(r) of Maxwell's equations. Depending upon how fine-grained an assessment of the electric field is required, more or less information about the charge array will have to be expressed by P(r). As explained below, sometimes it is sufficiently accurate to take P(r) = p(r). Sometimes a more detailed description is needed (for example, supplementing the dipole moment density with an additional quadrupole density) and sometimes even more elaborate versions of P(r) are necessary.|$|E

[...] Bono, admitting that his description is a little [...] "pretentious," [...] has {{referred to it as}} [...] "pop-up, pop-art opera," [...] noting that Julie Taymor is calling it a [...] "rock-and-roll circus drama." [...] Bono has also described the production as [...] "wrestling with the same stuff" [...] as [...] "Rilke, Blake, Wings of Desire, Roy Lichtenstein, [...] the Ramones." [...] A 60 Minutes CBS special stated that it is being called a [...] "comic book rock opera circus," [...] although in that segment Bono noted that even using [...] "rock" [...] to describe the music is too narrow a description, because [...] "We've moved out of the rock and roll idiom in places into some very new territory for us ... big show tunes and dance songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Temptation" [...] and [...] "The Hawaiian War Chant" [...] are {{percussion}} {{features that}} have been played by the MMB for over 45 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. [...] "Temptation" [...] is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. [...] "Temptation" [...] is played first. Followed by [...] "The Hawaiian War Chant," [...] which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, [...] "Because you can't have one without the other, 'The Hawaiian War Chant.'" [...] Until 1980, Temptation and the Hawaiian War Chant were generally not played together in a season until the Homecoming game, when the Alumni Band ("the Blast from the Past") would join in. Before Homecoming, in those years prior to 1980, the band would play Temptation, then the PA announcer would usually say that fans {{would have to wait}} for the other. Both percussion features have long been fan favorites. During the post-game band show, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> for Temptation, the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.|$|E
2500|$|This has {{particularly}} {{centered on}} the balance between the low emissions and high vulnerability {{of the developing world}} to climate change, compared to high emissions in the developed world. Another criticism of the Kyoto Protocol and other international conventions, is the right of indigenous peoples right to participate. Quoted here from The Declaration of the First International Forum of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change, it says [...] "Despite the recognition of our role in preventing global warming, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> to sign international conventions like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, once again, our right to participate in national and international discussions that directly affect or Peoples and territories is denied."

Furthermore, the debates under these instruments have not considered the suggestions and proposals of the Indigenous Peoples nor have the appropriate mechanisms to guarantee our participation in all the debates that directly concern the Indigenous Peoples has been established."Some environmentalists have supported the Kyoto Protocol because it is [...] "the only game in town," [...] and possibly because they expect that future emission reduction commitments may demand more stringent emission reductions (Aldy et al.., 2003, p.9). In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a [...] "small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases."
