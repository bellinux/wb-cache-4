5|$|Following the First Seminole <b>War</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{treaty with}} Spain, Florida became a U.S. {{territory}} in 1821. Under pressure from US settlers, Seminole and Black Seminoles began to migrate into {{central and southern}} Florida. In the early nineteenth century, African-American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the Bahamas from Cape Florida, including hundreds in the 1820s, to evade American slavers.|$|E
5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council {{that served as}} an advisory body to the king.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when {{he referred to}} it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, belonging to the Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed a sanctuary for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of the}} Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E

5|$|About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, {{which is}} known as the First Numantine <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> long war of {{resistance}} was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to private practice {{he was offered}} a cabinet post by his friend, President William McKinley, in 1896. He chose to become Secretary of the Navy despite lacking detailed knowledge of naval matters. He clashed with his Under-Secretary, Theodore Roosevelt, over expansion of the Navy when the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. He resigned the post after Roosevelt became president, and resumed his law practice. He died {{at his home in}} 1915; his publications include a lifelong journal, a history of the Spanish–American <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> verse translation of Virgil's Aeneid.|$|E

5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point of the <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in}} the aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|Joseph H. Allen (September 5, 1821 – April 24, 1884) was an {{industrial}} businessman, {{an officer in}} the Civil <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> town supervisor of Brunswick, New York. Allen was born in Alburg, Vermont, to parents of British descent and left home at an early age. After several business ventures, he became successful in the auger and hoe business, selling mainly to the American South. He successfully ran for supervisor of the Town of Brunswick in 1856 and justice of the peace in 1861. At the beginning of the Civil War, his sales plummeted so he closed his business and enlisted in the Union Army. Allen was wounded multiple times during his service and ended his career at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned home to reopen his factory, which was instrumental to the industrial success of the hamlet of Eagle Mills in the mid to late 19th century. He died in 1884 at the age of 62.|$|E

5|$|Proto-globalization {{distinguished}} {{itself from}} modern globalization {{on the basis}} of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period of proto-globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> rise of new commodities—most particularly slave trade. The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere. The transfer of plant and animal crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred Crosby's concept of The Columbian Exchange also {{played a central role in}} this process. Proto-globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the Iran–Contra affair lowered American credibility.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of His Country is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The patriotic film focuses on a man aptly named Walter North who sides with the Union and whilst his wife sides with the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The family is reunited thirty years later at a Grand Army of the Republic reunion through the actions of their grandchild. Little {{is known about the}} production and cast of the film, but the role of granddaughter was played by Marie Eline. Released on July 1, 1910, the film took place within living memory of the <b>war</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> reviewer in the The Moving Picture World specifically noted that the film would not offend its audience members. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
