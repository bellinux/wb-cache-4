40|$|Ram lambs, <b>wethers</b> and <b>wethers</b> {{implanted}} with Silastic capsules containing crystalline testerone {{were placed}} on test at 14. 9 ± 1. 1 kg and evaluated for differences in growth, performance, carcass characteristics and composition. Silastic implants that were able to maintain physiological concentrations of serum testosterone provided appropriate replacement therapy in <b>wethers.</b> Growth rate, efficiency of feed utilization and carcass yield of intact ram lambs and testosterone-implanted <b>wethers</b> were superior to the corresponding traits of <b>wethers.</b> <b>Wethers</b> had greater backfat thickness and percentage kidney and pelvic fat, and their carcasses graded {{higher than those of}} ram lambs or <b>wethers</b> implanted with a high dosage of testosterone. Empty body composition was significantly affected by treatment. Thus, intact rams contained more water and protein but less fat and gross energy than <b>wethers.</b> Testosterone-implanted <b>wethers</b> were intermediate in composition. Carcass water and protein were not significantly affected by treatment; however, carcass fat and gross energy were highest for <b>wethers</b> and lowest for intact rams. The relationship between testosterone and carcass fat and energy was dose dependent; i. e., decreased fat and energy were associated with proincreased serum testosterone. In conclusion, testosterone appears to be the principal testicular hormone responsible for the superior performance and preferred carcass traits characteristic of young market rams...|$|R
40|$|Relationships of {{implanted}} testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol- 17 β to collagen {{degradation and}} intramuscular collagen concentration and stability were determined. Intramuscular collagen content, solubility and shrinkage temperature and serum hydroxyproline were analyzed {{in groups of}} six rams, <b>wethers,</b> and <b>wethers</b> implanted with various levels of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (Exp. 1) and groups of 10 rams, <b>wethers</b> and <b>wethers</b> implanted with estradiol- 17 β, dihydrotestosterone {{or a combination of}} these two steroids (Exp. 2). Intramuscular collagen content in both experiments was higher (P 3 ̆c. 05) in muscles of rams than in muscles of <b>wethers.</b> Administration of the highest level of testosterone to <b>wethers</b> raised (P 3 ̆c. 05) total and insoluble intramuscular collagen to concentrations noted in rams. Administration of the testosterone metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, to <b>wethers</b> had no effect on intramuscular collagen. Administration of estradiol- 17 β to <b>wethers</b> tended to raise concentrations of intramuscular collagen so that they were no longer lower (P 3 ̆c. 05) than those in rams.

40|$|Profiles of LH and FSH {{levels and}} {{pituitary}} LH responses to exogenous luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) have been characterized in rams, castrated rams (<b>wethers),</b> and <b>wethers</b> implanted with testosterone. Rams were castrated when adult, and, {{at the time}} of castration, two groups of <b>wethers</b> were implanted with either four or eight testosterone capsules. Rams showed random pulses of LH and testosterone which were temporally related. The number of LH and testosterone pulses per 24 hours cliffeIed. among rams, giving rise to luge differences in the mean levels of these hormones. Mean FSH levels and pituitary LH responses to LHRH also differed among rams and were positively correlated to differences in LH levels. All three nonimplanted <b>wethers</b> showed a rhythmic pulsatile pattem of LH secretion and had elevated mean LH and FSH levels. There were, however, appreciable differences between <b>wethers</b> with regard to mean LH and FSH levels and pituitary LH responses to LHRH. Both four and eight testosterone capsules were effective in suppressing pulsatile LH secretion and mean LH and FSH levels in two out of three <b>wethers.</b> In a third animal within each of these groups, however, LH and FSH profiles and LH responses to LHRH were characteristic of nonimplanted <b>wethers.</b> These data suggest that individual rams have different inherent capacities to secrete gonadotropins which influence l.
