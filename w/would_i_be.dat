500|$|Caragiale {{showed little}} {{surprise}} at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in late 1880, {{letters from}} Pedro II to the Countess of Barral reveal a man grown world-weary {{with age and}} having an {{increasingly}} alienated and pessimistic outlook. In them he frequently expresses [...] "his loneliness and his desire to escape into her company." [...] The Emperor entertained a fantasy of leaving everything behind and realizing his cherished ambition of taking up a life in Europe, as he expressed it: [...] "and I, were I to enjoy my total independence, where <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>be?</b> Guess." [...] This strong desire to retire to a less circumscribed life abroad was a constant presence throughout the 1880s. Despite the dichotomy between reverie and reality, he remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the Imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, {{with little}} {{work to be}} found in the comic book field due to a {{downturn}} in the industry, he went to work as an assistant to John Prentice on the Alex Raymond-created comic strip Rip Kirby for a three-year period. According to Williamson: [...] "The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac , John's prior assistant, didn't want to go... The deal was: <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> willing to go to Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..." [...] It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: [...] "...he was terrific. He's the best guy I ever had by far." [...] During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the Big Ben Bolt boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip Dan Flagg. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of Modesty Blaise.|$|E

500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right. And <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> able to look {{at myself in the mirror}} happily? No. Is it time to stop because I've reached the end, yes, and I think I'd rather leave while I'm in love." [...] The final issue, No. 75, was dated March 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved."
