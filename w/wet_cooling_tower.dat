25|$|In a <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> (or {{open circuit}} cooling tower), {{the warm water}} can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, if the air is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E

40|$|A system {{optimization}} of ORCs cooled by air-cooled condensers or <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> and powered by low-temperature geothermal heat sources is performed in this paper. The {{configuration of the}} ORC is optimized together with the geometry of all the components. The objective is to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) {{and the performance of}} ORCs with different types of cooling systems are compared to each other. The results show that it is economically more interesting to use mechanical-draft <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> instead of air-cooled condensers. The difference in performance is especially large for a low brine-inlet temperature. The investment cost of <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> is much lower than the one of air-cooled condensers, so the discount rate has less influence on the former type of cooling. The effect of the water price and the climate conditions on the economics of ORCs is also investigated. Both the brine-inlet temperature and the dry-bulb temperature of the surroundings have a strong influence and values of the optimized LCOE between about 55 and 185 €/MWh are obtained. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{overheating}} of the river Neckar, both blocks have cooling towers. These are not built in the usual way. Block I uses two rows of cell cooling towers. Each row has a length of 186.8 meters and a height of 18 meters. Block II uses a hybrid cooling tower with a height of 51.22 meters. It was originally going to use a <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower,</b> but later {{it was decided to}} use dry cooling towers because it would have less effect on the environment though more expensive. This unique type of cooling tower causes the unique shape seen in pictures.|$|E
25|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> used in {{coal-fired}} power stations, etc. emit drift and fog {{which are also}} an environmental concern. The drift contains Respirable suspended particulate matter.

25|$|Respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter, {{of less than}} 10 micrometers (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from <b>cooling</b> <b>towers.</b> Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems.

This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue of solar cooling facilities based on absorption cycles and sometimes {{not given the}} necessary attention is the recooling process of the absorber and condenser. This is critical in the overall behaviour of the facility because the condensation and absorption temperatures will affect the COP and cooling capacity of the chiller. Most {{of the time the}} recooling process is made by using a <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> in a closed loop through the absorber and condenser. The use of a <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> gives good results in terms of cooling capacity and COP, but presents some health risk, like legionella, and its use is restricted to the industrial sector and places where water scarcity is not present. This paper presents the modification of the already validated TRNSYS simulation of a solar cooling facility, implementing a geothermal heat sink instead of the <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> in order to dissipate the heat generated internally in the absorption chiller.

40|$|Particulate matter {{less than}} 10 {{micrometers}} in diameter (PM 10) emissions from <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> may be calculated using the methodology presented in EPA’s AP- 421, which assumes that all {{total dissolved solids}} (TDS) emitted in “drift ” particles (liquid water entrained in the air stream and carried out of the tower through the induced draft fan stack.) are PM 10. However, for <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>towers</b> with medium to high TDS levels, this method is overly conservative, and predicts significantly higher PM 10 emissions than would actually occur, even for towers equipped with very high efficiency drift eliminators (e. g., 0. 0006 % drift rate). Such over-prediction may result in unrealistically high PM 10 modeled concentrations and/or the need to purchase expensive Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) in PM 10 non-attainment areas. Since these towers have fairly low emission points (10 to 15 m above ground), over-predicting PM 10 emission rates can easily result in exceeding federal Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) significance levels at a project’s fenceline.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model {{was developed and}} {{used to assess the}} sensitivity of thermal performance characteristics of a closed <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> to inlet air conditions. In the present study, three cases of different ambient conditions are considered: In the first case, the average mid-winter and mid-summer conditions as well as the extreme case of high temperature and relative humidity, in Athens (Greece) during summer are considered according to the Greek Regulation for Buildings Energy Performance. In the second case, the varied inlet air relative humidity while the inlet air dry bulb temperature remains constant were taken into account. In the last case, the effects on cooling tower thermal behaviour when the inlet air wet bulb temperature remains constant were examined. The proposed model is capable of predicting the variation of air thermodynamic properties, sprayed water and serpentine water temperature inside the closed <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> along its height. The reliability of simulations was tested against experimental data, which were obtained from literature. Thus, the proposed model could be used for the design of industrial and domestic applications of conventional air-conditioning systems as well as for sorption cooling systems with solid and liquid desiccants where closed wet cooling towers are used for precooling the liquid solutions. The most important result of this theoretical investigation is that the highest fall of serpentine water temperature and losses of sprayed water are observed for the lowest value of inlet wet bulb temperature. Hence, the thermal effectiveness, which is associated with the temperature reduction of serpentine water as well as the operational cost, which is related to the sprayed water loss due to evaporation, of a closed <b>wet</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> depend predominantly on the degree of saturation of inlet air.
