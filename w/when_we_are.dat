25|$|All warfare {{is based}} on deception.

25|$|God expects us to rule {{this country}} because {{we are the only}} {{organisation}} which was blessed by pastors when it was formed. It is even blessed in Heaven.

25|$|By August 1898 she was {{receiving}} offers from English managers of comic opera. The Belle of New York was staged at the Shaftesbury Theatre with Harry Davenport in the company.

In the musical they sang a famous duet, <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Married.|$|E
25|$|Various {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some atheists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit). Taking a nuanced position, philosopher Del Ratzsch suggests that the application of the razor to God may not be so simple, least of all <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> comparing that hypothesis with theories postulating multiple invisible universes.|$|E
25|$|The exemplar-based {{approaches}} claim listeners {{store information}} for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds {{are stored in}} the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a talker, all the memory traces of utterances produced by that talker are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> familiar with the talker or when we have visual representation of the talker's gender. When the talker is unpredictable or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not always}} that we had {{shopping}} to do, although we generally managed to want something, {{as a sort of}} excuse for going; but we both enjoyed it much, it was all so new to us; for <b>we</b> had never <b>been</b> in London at all, except at the time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at school--and then, of course, we never went up into London itself, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> staying respectively with Lady Desborough and Ada, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> very much too grand to go out shopping on foot.

25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Noël Coward's Relative Values, {{played at}} the theatre, having premièred there in 1951, an {{original}} run of 477 performances. Tom Stoppard's Travesties, with Antony Sher was next, and in 1994 the musical She Loves Me played, with Ruthie Henshall and John Gordon Sinclair. These were followed by Terry Johnson's Dead Funny; Alan Ayckbourn's Communicating Doors (which transferred to the theatre in 1996), with Angela Thorne; J. B. Priestley's <b>When</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Married, with Dawn French, Alison Steadman, and Leo McKern; and Ben Travers' Plunder, with Griff Rhys Jones and Kevin McNally. In 1997 a group led by Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen was given management of the theatre by The Savoy Group. Productions that followed included Simon Callow in The Importance of Being Oscar; Pet Shop Boys in concert, Ian Richardson in Pinero's The Magistrate; Edward Fox in A Letter of Resignation; the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Richard III, with Robert Lindsay; and Coward's Hay Fever, with Geraldine McEwan in 1999.|$|E

500|$|The American novelist Judith Freeman {{wrote that}} one of the common themes in The Good Terrorist is that of keeping one's {{identity}} in a collective, of preserving [...] "individual conscience".

500|$|Killen {{said that}} writing the pilot episode's script {{was one of}} the more-difficult {{components}} of creating the show.

Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas.
