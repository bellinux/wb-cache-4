40|$|Abstract. Bulb mites of {{the genus}} Rhizoglyphus (Claparède) (Acari: Acaridae) have been {{identified}} as pests of many crops and ornamentals in storage, in the greenhouse, and in the field. The most important hosts are species in the family Liliaceae (e. g. Allium spp.), but bulb mites will often attack other important crops such as potatoes (Solanum sp.) and carrots (Daucus carota).

In addition, the field biology and ecology of these mites is not well understood, and methods for sampling, monitoring, and loss assessment are limited. Management of bulb mites is complicated by their short generation time, high reproductive potential, broad food niche, interactions with other pests and pathogens, and unique adaptations for dispersal.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCT) {{offer an}} opportunity to learn about frequency and character of adverse drug reactions. To improve the quality of reporting adverse effects, the Consort group published recommendations. The authors studied the application of these recommendations in RCTs performed in children. DESIGN: Literature search. RESULTS: The authors found 107 articles on paediatric RCTs written in English and published between 1 January 2006 and 1 April 2009. 83 articles (78 %) mentioned adverse drug reactions, 36 articles (34 %) used standardised methods for the disclosure of adverse drug reactions, 33 articles (31 %) tabulated the reactions, and 27 (25 %) stated numbers of and reasons for <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>of</b> the RCT did not influence reporting. Sponsoring did lead to better reporting. According to the Consort guidelines, 19 (18 %) reported safety data adequately. CONCLUSION: Reporting of adverse drug reactions in RCTs is often inadequate. Authors should anticipate and define adverse drug reactions. During research all adverse events should be monitored and assessed actively. Monitoring and assessment should be described in articles in accordance with the extended Consort recommendations. Both authors and editors share the responsibility for the improvement of reporting safety data...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{screening}} trials a number of new, non-mercurial fungicides have shown promising results in controlling pineapple disease of sugarcane (Ceratocystis paradoxa). Several of the fungicides tested are as effective as Aretan and Benlate and are now registered for use in sugarcane. Growers now {{have a choice of}} effective non-mercurial fungicides for sett dip treatment. Poor germination of sugarcane setts under conditions that are not optimum for rapid germination can often be attributed to pineapple disease, caused by the fungus Ceratocystis paradoxa. Whenever conditions for germination are adverse, because of low soil temperatures, drought or waterlogged soils, infection of the setts can affect germination considerably. Varieties differ in their susceptibility to pineapple disease but gerinination failures can occur in most varieties under adverse conditions if control measures are not applied before planting. An effective way of controlling the disease is by dipping the setts in a protective fungicide before planting. Because of the high costs of gap filling and the deleterious effects of poor and slow germination 011 cane growth, sett treatment is always advisable. Treatment is pa. rticularly recommended for autumn planting, when conditiins are often adverse, and after hot water treatment, when susceptibility may be increased. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> of compounds based on mercury for use in sugarcane in South Africa, and the phasing out of these materials in recent years, have necessitated a search for alternative, effective fungicides. Benlate (benomyl) was the first non-mercurial fungicide found to provide effective control of pineapple disease, (Mitchell-Innes and Thomson 3 and it has now been used by growers for several years. A number of other fungicides have also been reported to show promise (Mitchell-Innes and Thomson 3). This paper describes three recent field trials for the evaluation of fungicides for control of pineapple disease...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R
