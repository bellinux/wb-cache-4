5|$|Due to {{security}} regulations {{put in place}} by the Olympic organizers, no spectators <b>were</b> <b>permitted</b> to stand roadside along the course.

McQuaid and O'Grady both felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. Cycling Australia's reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow, but they were not.|$|E

5|$|In a Russification {{drive in}} the 1840s, Nicholas I {{prohibited}} use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith.
