5000|$|Related, many {{video games}} have adopted CCG-type {{mechanics}} {{as part of}} a larger gameplay mechanism. In such games, the player earns cards as rewards in the game, often following similar rarity systems for distribution, and can customize some type of deck which influences other areas of the game's mechanics. An early example of this hybrid game is Phantom Dust (2004) which primarily was a third-person shooter, but where the player's attack and defense abilities <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> an customized [...] "arsenal" [...] of powers that they collected through the course of the game. Similarly, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (2004) is a role-playing game where the combat mechanic was based on attacks pulled from a deck of cards constructed outside of the combat rounds. Other examples of CCG-hybrid games include Forced: Showdown, Hand of Fate, and Card Hunter.|$|E
50|$|Pontiac sub-contracted {{the job of}} {{engineering}} the TTA engine modifications to PAS. The narrow engine bay of the Trans Am required the use of different cylinder heads, which happened to have better flow characteristics than the old Buick heads. Special stainless steel headers were made specifically for the project as well. The heads, headers, along with more refined tuning of the boost and fuel curves, all added up to a more powerful package than the older Buicks. PAS was also in charge of testing and assembling the engines. Most TTA's came with T-tops and leather interior, {{but there were also}} hardtops and cloth-interior cars. And every TTA had an automatic transmission - the TH200-4R, equipped with overdrive and a torque converter clutch. The three actual pace cars <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the production run, and sent to Indianapolis to pace the race. Thus, the pace car replicas were closer to the actual pace cars than any replica previously offered; the only difference between the replicas and the three actual pace cars was the addition of strobe lights and safety equipment to the latter. In addition, the TTA was relatively economical to drive; it returned 24 mpg on the highway, while the only cars (besides the Lotus Esprit Turbo SE) that could approach its performance at the time (Ferraris, Lamborghinis, etc.) were far more costly, and providing only around 10 to 12 mpg. As has been proven to be the case in subsequent years, relying on a small engine for cruising, and a turbocharger for power, provides an exciting driving experience while returning impressive fuel mileage.|$|E

Following a tag team match that went no contest in February 2007, his team won six consecutive matches against the heel factions. Rivera himself defeated Estrellas' members Kafu, Mikael Judas and the [...] "Colossus" [...] Michael Jarvis. He and Cotto formed a regular tag team to feud with Jarvis and Judas, earning a 2-1 advantage. Rivera went on to defeat Jarvis twice and get discualified against Kafu leading to Summer Attitude 2007. Subsequently, Rivera joined Sewell to form a tag team, winning two matches against the Estrellas. He then entered a feud against Figueroa, with both of their matches going inconclusive. He remained in a feud with Toledo's Estrellas stable until early 2007, when the former left the company following an event where Rivera sided with Pérez when a conflict between him and Mario Savoldi. Upon retaking his role as General Manager, he became {{the leader of a}} new heel stable known as [...] "Los Auntenticos" [...] along Pérez and Ricky Vega. This faction was quickly involved in an angle dealing with a power struggle against several other stables within the company. In his first match following a forced hiatus, Los Autenticos got disqualified in a match against González and Figueroa. They went on to defeat [...] "Los Rabiosos", composed by Freddie [...] "Blitz" [...] Lozada and Maldonado. Rivera entered a feud against Lozada, after the former teamed with Ricky Vega to defeat Los Autenticos. On June 14, 2008, he defeated Vega. Rivera went then entered a feud with Bison Smith, losing twice. On October 4, 2008, he wrestled The Sheik to a no contest. The stable eventually grew to include Rivera's younger brother Dennis Rivera and his tag team partner Noel Rodríguez. Los Auntenticos would then create a [...] "terror list" [...] where the names of former WWC employees were written. This list was used in a new angle were the stable would ambush and attack wrestlers that <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>from</b> the list. At Golpe de Estado, Los Autenticos lost in a Boricua Rumble match, before winning their following appearance. As a sidetrack, Rivera ran a mock campaign to become Governor of Puerto Rico for the fictional Partido Luchador Puertorriqueño (PLP) prior to the 2008 general elections. The closure to the Loteria del Terror came when the other members turned on Rivera and Pérez, citing that [...] "they themselves were part of Capitol once", igniting a sibling rivalry against Dennis Rivera who was supported by Noel Rodríguez and Richard Rondón. The feud continued with matches between both, Los Autenticos lost two tag team matches against this team, known as [...] "La Malicia". In matches between brothers, the result was a no contest and a win by Dennis Rivera. Concurrently, he entered a second feud against Joe Bravo and his own stable, [...] "La Compañia Elite". Rivera and Pérez won a match against two lowcard members of La Compañia. At the IWA's 10th Anniversary show, He wrestled Bravo to a no contest, with the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship being held up. Rivera lost the rematch.|$|E
