25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make {{a down payment on}} a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees for the purpose of making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E
500|$|According to Dave Mustaine, {{the band}} have {{encountered}} numerous mishaps and odd occurrences. In {{an interview with}} Terrorizer magazine, Mustaine, taking note of the connection to the unlucky number 13, explained [...] "This is our 13th studio record, and we've already {{had a bunch of}} weird things happen. Car problems, stuff disappearing, a guy who <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> that was the most white-laced guy you could imagine falling out on drugs and disappearing... but this one's got me excited!" [...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered. In an interview, Drover had said nothing weird occurred until after he finished recording drum tracks for the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Halo 3 {{contained}} refinements and revisions to previous themes {{heard in the}} series, as O'Donnell {{stressed the importance of}} using previous motifs in the final installment of the trilogy; the composer wanted to [...] "blow out" [...] the epic sounds from the first game. O'Donnell also introduced a distinctive piano theme which had never been heard before, and first made its appearance in the Halo 3 announcement teaser. In an interview, O'Donnell stated that he has always approached music from the keyboard, and that at the Electronic Entertainment Expo—where the trailer would first be shown—he had a feeling that, [...] "no [...] would start with a piano." [...] O'Donnell planned on composing the music [...] "at the last minute", saying {{he had no intention of}} producing a large amount of music that would never be used. [...] "It drives everyone crazy but it <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the past and it works for the game in the best way. Writing music before the end just doesn't work for me," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Although Alice in Chains never officially disbanded, Staley {{became a}} recluse, rarely leaving his Seattle {{condominium}} {{following the death}} of his ex-fiancée Demri Parrott due to infective endocarditis. [...] "Drugs <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> for years", Staley told Rolling Stone in 1996, [...] "and now they're turning against me... now I'm walking through hell". Unable to continue with new Alice in Chains material, Cantrell released his first solo album, Boggy Depot, in 1998, also featuring Sean Kinney and Mike Inez. In 1998, Staley reunited with Alice in Chains to record two new songs, [...] "Get Born Again" [...] and [...] "Died". Originally intended for Cantrell's second solo album, the songs were reworked by Alice in Chains and were released in the fall of 1999 on the box set, Music Bank. The set contains 48 songs, including rarities, demos, and previously released album tracks and singles. The band also released a 15-track compilation titled , serving as a sampler for Music Bank, as well as the band's first compilation album; a live album, simply titled Live, released on December 5, 2000; and a second compilation, titled Greatest Hits in 2001.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers Lindelof and Cuse were {{initially}} {{worried about how}} the freighter folk characters would be received by fans, after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro), introduced in season three. However, following their introduction in [...] "Confirmed Dead", the four characters were well received, with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show's improved ratings. Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad wrote that within one episode Fahey had already won her over, and called Frank her favorite new Lost character. IGN's Chris Carabott described Frank, {{as well as the}} other new characters from the freighter, as [...] "great" [...] and [...] "exciting", writing that: [...] "Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts praised the casting of the freighter folk, noting that Fahey had been a personal favourite of his since his appearance in The Marshall. He deemed the group all stronger actors than former Lost stars Michelle Rodriguez, Rodrigo Santoro, Maggie Grace and Ian Somerhalder, and expressed hope that they would remain on the show longer. Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called the new characters [...] "fascinating" [...] and wrote that they [...] "totally <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> while their intriguing backstories left me jonesing for more." [...] Peter Mucha of The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed Frank's flashback [...] "mind-bending", and Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] the [...] "perfect introduction" [...] to the new characters, writing that he could not wait to find out more about them. Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also enjoyed their introduction, and praised the actors' performances. Casey Gillis for The News & Advance highlighted the introduction of the freighter folk as one of the highlights of the season, opining that they [...] "fit seamlessly into the ensemble", while Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones praised the season for introducing Frank, who he deemed [...] "a real cult figure." [...] In contrast, James Poniewozik of Time was critical of Lapidus. He wrote that he was amazed by the economy and precision with which the new characters were introduced because [...] "Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet by the end of the episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] He appended, however, that this was: [...] "with the possible exception of Frank, who seems a bit too generic-drunk-hippie-guy for now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, his {{eyesight}} began failing as {{a result}} of the large volume of required reading and the poor visibility under gaslights. The school doctors suggested he give up school entirely. He found another alternative: paying fellow law students to read the textbooks aloud, while he tried to memorize the legal principles. Despite the difficulties, his academic work and memorization talents were so impressive that he graduated as valedictorian and achieved the highest grade point average in the history of the school, a record that stood for eight decades. Brandeis said of that period: [...] "Those years were among the happiest of my life. I <b>worked!</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> the world's center was Cambridge." ...|$|E

When asked what he tells his children about profanity, he recalled telling his kids that there are [...] "appropriate times to use any kind of language. ...

Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman.

2500|$|Underwood {{has been}} highly {{acclaimed}} for her vocal talents. David Wild of Rolling Stone has praised her voice, saying that [...] "she can hit any note". Her vocal range {{has been described}} as [...] "enormous", with critics highlighting her ability to hold notes {{for an extended period of}} time. Billboard describes her vocal ability as [...] "freakish". Concert critics have pointed out that [...] "she’ll let loose with an improbably long note that runs through more octaves than you knew existed". When asked if it ever becomes difficult to belt at such high intensity during her 90–120 minute live shows, Underwood responded, [...] "I'm too proud to drop keys. I won't do it. Maybe the older I get, I'll write some songs in lower keys so it'll be easier. I've always been pretty good as far as stamina onstage. Being able to work out and stay physically strong is important... So far, it's <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I'm just blessed at being able to be loud for long periods of time." [...] Fellow country music singer Randy Travis paid high praises to Underwood's voice when asked about her cover of his 1988 hit song [...] "I Told You So", saying that [...] "her voice is so much better suited to the song. I have a baritone voice, and her soprano voice really fits well with the range of the song. Her ability to get into the upper register of her voice and just hold those high notes is great." [...] Her voice has also been praised as [...] "versatile". She has indeed performed live versions of gospel songs like [...] "How Great Thou Art", in which Yahoo! critics noticed her ability to move an audience with a [...] "powerful performance", and Rock songs like Guns N' Roses' [...] "Paradise City", with Rolling Stone critics saying it was a [...] "standout performance", adding that [...] "when the song reached its crescendo, the singer went right over the edge with it, twirling like a tornado and tossing in more than a few banshee wails" [...] and even saying [...] "if the original members of Guns N' Roses ever wanted to reunite without Axl Rose, they might be wise to ask Carrie Underwood to fill his bandana".|$|E
