5000|$|Of {{the more}} [...] "manifest crimes", as Tertullian refers to them, he first {{addresses}} {{the charges of}} sacrilege and says that Christians do not worship the pagan gods because the gods are not real, do not exist and thus hold no power or control over anything. Saturn, he claims, was once a mere man, as Roman lore and history will demonstrate. He then refutes further claims that the gods received their divinity through death, and wonders what business would the gods have with wanting ministers and assistants that are already dead. Such powerless beings cannot even {{be responsible for the}} rise and success of the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the character and nature of the gods themselves leave much to be desired; they are filled with rage, incestuous thoughts, envy, and jealousy. Why then should such imperfect and wicked beings be worthy of praise? He makes an even greater argument in referring to the pagan gods as demons, whose sole purpose is the subversion and destruction of mankind. They corrupt the souls of men by passions and lusts and rather successfully procuring [...] "for themselves a proper diet of fumes and blood offered to their statues images". In this way they draw attention to themselves and prevent people from turning to the true God. But even the demons acknowledge the power of God, and acknowledging this should be enough to clear the Christians of charges of sacrilege. For Tertullian, the Romans are at fault here for worshipping the wrong religion, not that of the one true God. But if the gods are real, and if the Christians are guilty of sacrilege, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Rome? The people all worship different gods and often treat their images with less respect than they deserve, using any opportunity to pawn their statues off and use them as sources of income. Tertullian further criticizes their literature, practices and ceremonies, calling them absurd and criticizing their philosophers’ disgraceful actions. Socrates would swear by dogs and Diogenes and Varro made less than respectful comments concerning the deities. The plays constantly make jokes about and mockery of the gods. Surely, he argue, the plays and the masks must be disrespectful to the gods. It is the Romans then that are guilty of sacrilege and impiety.|$|E

5000|$|Responding to the {{controversy}} Ridley defended the play, describing {{what he felt}} were double standards within the theatrical establishment, {{in that it is}} acceptable for there to be scenes of violence in classical drama but not within contemporary plays: [...] "Why is it that it is fine for the classic plays to discuss - even show - these things, but people are outraged when contemporary playwrights do it? If you go to see King Lear, you see a man having his eyes pulled out; in Medea, a woman slaughters her own children. The recent revival of Iphigenia at the National was acclaimed for its relevance. But when you try to write about the world around us, people get upset. If I'd wrapped Mercury Fur up as a recently rediscovered Greek tragedy it would be seen as an interesting moral debate like Iphigenia, but because it is set on an east-London housing estate it is seen as being too dangerous to talk about. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the world we live in? What does it say about theatre today?"Ridley also explained that he felt critics had disliked Mercury Fur because of its subject matter and not for the theatrical experience the play is trying to create for its audience: “I don’t think there is anything wrong with people being disturbed within the theatre at all… I think theatre is fifteen years behind any other art form... It’s still perceived as a kind of subject matter based art form. You wouldn’t go along and look at a Suzanne painting and criticize it just on the choice of apples she’s chosen to paint, you’d criticize it, and you’d judge it and experience it for the use of paint… Because we come from a basic literal tradition we still view stage plays as kind of glorified novels and we judge them purely on their subject matter, regardless of the theatrical experience of sitting there and watching the play.” Ridley also defended the depiction of violence within the story, arguing that is used for a moral purpose and that the play is more about love than violence:"The things that happen in Mercury Fur are not gratuitous, they are heart-breaking. The people may do terrible things but everything they do is out of love, in an attempt to keep each other safe. The play is me asking, 'What would I do in that position?' If you knew that to keep your mother, brother and lover safe, you would have to do terrible things, would you still do them? That's the dilemma of the play. It asks us all, 'What lengths would you go to to save the people you love?'" ...|$|E

40|$|As our {{understanding}} of the genetic structure of our species has advanced, and our technological ability to manipulate that structure has become increasingly sophisticated, so we are increasingly able to screen foetuses for genetically-based conditions. That much is uncontroversial. What is controversial, however, is what, if anything, it is morally right to do with this knowledge and this ability. On the one hand, to prevent, if we can, people being born who will suffer grievously on account of a condition brought about by their genetic make-up would seem at least morally permissible, if not morally required.

These sentiments are indicative of the stories shared by teachers in this study that explored (1) the motivations of senior teachers who become mentors and (2) the representations of novice teachers regarding the contributions of their senior mentors. Situated in the interpretive constructivist paradigm and using the lived experiences of mentors and mentees, participant stories were collected and analyzed in the context of rapid enrolment decline and limited hiring of new teachers in Nova Scotia. While senior teachers indicated that they entered into mentoring relationships with a sense of duty to the profession, the novice teachers reported that help was not always forthcoming. An undercurrent that novices had to pay their dues to the profession was suggested. Both mentors and mentees were probed as to the value they placed on the mentoring relationship and data analysis indicated all participants greatly valued the experience. An examination of the themes emerging from the data include a discussion of the effects of school culture on the motivation of senior teachers to engage as mentors and the use of a network of mentors to encourage and develop the professional growth of novice teachers...|$|E
40|$|From the now iconic Barack Obama "Hope" {{poster of}} the 2008 presidential {{campaign}} to the pit-head "Camp Hope" {{of the families}} of the trapped Chilean miners, the language of hope can be hugely powerful as it draws on resources that are uniquely human and universal. We are beings who hope. But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> us? What is hope and what role does it play in our lives? In his fascinating and thought-provoking investigation into the meaning of hope, Stan van Hooft shows that hope is a fundamental structure of the way we live our lives. For Aristotle being hopeful was part of a well-lived life, a virtue. For Aquinas it was a fundamentally theological virtue and for Kant a basic moral motivation. It shapes how we view ourselves and {{the world in which we}} live. Whether we hope for a life after death or for good weather tomorrow – whether our hopes are grand or humble – hoping is part of our outlook on life. What we hope for defines who we are. Drawing on everyday examples as well as more detailed discussion of hope in the arenas of medicine, politics and religion, van Hooft shows how hopefulness in not the same as hope and offers a convincing and powerful defense of the need for realism. There are few contemporary philosophical discussions of hope and Stan van Hooft’s book offers an accessible and insightful discussion of the topic that shows the relevance of philosophical thinking and distinctions to this important aspect of human life...|$|E
40|$|Recently, much {{philosophical}} {{discussion has}} centered on {{the best way to}} characterize the concepts of random drift and natural selection, and, in particular, {{on the question of whether}} selection and drift can be conceptually distinguished (Beatty 1984; Brandon 2005; Hodge 1983, 1987; Millstein 2002, 2005; Pfeifer 2005; Shanahan 1992; Stephens 2004). These authors all contend, to a greater or lesser degree, that their concepts make sense of biological practice. So, it should be instructive to see how the concepts of drift and selection were distinguished by the disputants in a high-profile debate; debates such as these often force biologists to take a more philosophical turn, discussing the concepts at issue in greater detail than usual. A prime candidate for just such a case study is what William Provine (1986) has termed “The Great Snail Debate,” that is, the debate over the highly polymorphic land snails Cepaea nemoralis and Cepaea hortensis in the 1950 s and early 1960 s. This study will reveal that much of the present-day confusion over the concepts of drift and selection is rooted in confusions of the past. Nonetheless, there are lessons that can be learned about nonadaptiveness, indiscriminate sampling, and causality with respect to these two concepts. In particular, this paper will shed light on the following questions: 1) What is “drift”? Is “drift” a purely mathematical construct, a physical process analogous to the indiscriminate sampling of balls from an urn, or the outcome of a sampling process? 2) What is “nonadaptiveness,” and is a proponent of drift committed to claims that organisms’ traits are nonadaptive? 3) Can disputes concerning selection and drift be settled by statistics alone, or is causal information essential?

40|$|How is {{virtuality}} {{represented in}} fiction, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> our anticipations and fears {{about what the}} virtual is and will be? This text, a poetics of virtuality, explores fictional representations of virtuality, primarily in movies and literature, but also in media productions done by the author. The aim is to study the dream of virtuality. What are we promised? What do we anticipate? What do we fear? This is why the study has focused on fictional virtualities, where the storyteller is somewhat free to represent the virtual, and let cultural ideas emerge, untethered by the technical constraints that govern real-life virtuality technology. The study has two methodological approaches. One is the analysis {{of a large number}} of fictional narrative texts representing virtuality, primarily movies but also a few novels and short stories. The other is the study of the author’s own work producing media products involving virtuality. The chosen research design utilizes the author’s position as both an academic and a computer graphic artist. The studied fictional narratives have been analyzed using semiotics, a method to study signs and sign production. A self- and auto-ethnographic approach has been used to observe the author’s media productions. The contribution of this study is a deep and detailed understanding of how virtuality is represented in fiction, presented as a poetics of virtuality. Seven topologies of virtuality are presented: #surrealism, #containment, #engineered space, #artificial light, #immateriality, #control, and #virtual artificial intelligence. In summary, the results show that: It was advantageous to combine film studies with auto-ethnographic observations, but also highly time consuming Fictional representations of virtuality are largely based on real-life technology, especially older computer technology Fictional representations of virtuality are quite highly constrained by production circumstances and storytelling requirements Volumetric displays are highly anticipated, but the need to use augmented reality to implement the vision might surprise us Virtuality is often thought of as being in opposition to the real and the natural; it is also often thought of as being a lesser copy of the actual A major theme is breaking out of the virtual, and this falsely promises that there can be an escape from the virtual, and from technology...|$|E
