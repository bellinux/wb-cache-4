25|$|One {{point that}} the French had a major problem with was the concept of sanctuary. As long as the revolutionaries <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> a guerilla war have a sanctuary, {{in which they can}} hide out, recoup after losses, and store supplies, it is almost {{impossible}} for any foreign enemy to ever destroy them. In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Bằng.|$|E

The sky begins to dawn, and the people around Noda and the girl are shot. A man sets a car on fire, and is later shot down {{by a group of}} men with guns. Near the end of the song, the pair come up to a pile of bodies and severed limbs, along with people crying over their bodies. The rest of the band members perform the song in this scene. Noda leaves the girl to close the eyes of a dead boy, and covers him with his jacket. The girl gets up from her wheelchair, and drops her flash light. She screams, removing her headphones and blindfold to reveal that her eyes have been sewn shut.|$|E

Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it is a terrible thing to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E

Hill did not campaign for same-sex marriage, however, and did not cosponsor legislation brought by 121 Democrats to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. As public attitudes changed, Hill's position shifted, and in 2015, while running for Senate, Hill said: [...] "Marriage equality is especially close to my own heart.

He added it was a realistic portrayal of the events of combat, including the sheer relief of survival followed by cathartic stress relief. Sengupta also stated that the prolonged period of filming from before and after deployment allowed Kemp to realistically portray the effects of intensive close combat, where soldiers become fitter and appear to age markedly, weather-beaten, and become introspective with the so-called [...] "thousand yard stare".|$|E
