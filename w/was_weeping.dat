500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, but I actually cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I <b>was</b> <b>weeping</b> for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|While Soviet {{forces were}} {{initially}} successful in recapturing Kharkiv, {{they found themselves}} trapped by the German Army after the closing of Barvenkovo. On 18 May, Bagramyan asked Timoshenko to alter the plans but Timoshenko along with Stalin refused to approve his request. Soviet losses were heavy as the 6th, 9th and 57th armies (approximately 18–20 divisions) comprising {{a large portion of}} the Southwestern Front, were all destroyed and Bagramyan was removed from his post on 28 June by STAVKA. According to Khrushchev, Bagramyan was so devastated from the immense loss of men that after the operation was called off, [...] "he burst into tears. His nerves cracked...He <b>was</b> <b>weeping</b> for our army." [...] Held responsible for the failure of the operation and [...] "poor staff work", he was demoted to chief of staff of the Soviet 28th Army. Several days later, he wrote a letter to Stalin asking to [...] "serve at the front at any capacity, however modest." [...] British military historian John Erickson contends that Bagramyan was unfairly scapegoated by Stalin in his attempts to [...] "hunt for [...] culprits" [...] of the mismanagement of operations.|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{and local}} Macabebe {{soldiers}} broke into loud laughter seeing the kneeling Duman in a feverish frenzy of emotion. [...] But unknown to them, Fr. Vicente Lapus {{was standing right}} behind the closed church door listening and watching everything through the small cracks. (This was how Payumu's prayer was recorded by Padre Lapus for posterity). The impatient Spanish lieutenant barked: “Puñeta! Todo esto lo que haces es ya de masiado! Levantate!” (Goddammit! This is all simply getting too much! Stand up!). Knowing no Spanish, Duman remained kneeling down and <b>was</b> <b>weeping</b> in utter hopelessness feeling abandoned to certain death by the Apu. [...] Without warning, a local soldier grabbed his arm and forcefully pulled him up, yelling: “Puta naida mo! Ticdo na ca canu! Panaca ning alte! (Son of a bitch! Stand up now! You thunderstrucked!). Losing his balance, Duman fell to the ground. The guards pulled him up and brusquely pushed him forward to the execution spot, which was the corner church wall before reaching the present sacristy door.|$|E
2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked {{him for what he}} had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, moaning and sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and asked him why he <b>was</b> <b>weeping.</b> Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, you are as impudent as a dog, because it was you who advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
