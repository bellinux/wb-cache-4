50|$|Evidence of the {{capacity}} for invertebrates to experience nociception and pain has been widely studied in crustaceans. In the crab Neohelice granulata, electric shocks delivered via small holes in the carapace elicited a defensive threat display. Injection of morphine reduced the crabs' sensitivity to the shock in a dose-dependent manner, with the effect declining with increasing duration between morphine injection and shock. Naloxone injection inhibited the effects of morphine, as is seen in vertebrates. Morphine also had inhibitory effects on the escape tail-flick response to electric shock in the mantis shrimp, Squilla mantis, that was reversed by naloxone, indicating that the effect is found in crustacean groups other than decapods. When the irritants acetic acid or sodium hydroxide were applied to the antennae of grass prawns, Penaeus monodon, {{there was an increase}} in rubbing and grooming of the treated areas which was not seen if they had previously been treated with a local anaesthetic, benzocaine, however, the benzocaine did not eliminate the level of rubbing seen in response to mechanical stimulation with forceps. There was no effect of benzocaine on the general locomotion of the prawns, so the reduction in rubbing and grooming was not simply due to inactivity of the animal. Another local anaesthetic, xylocaine, reduced the stress of eyestalk ablation in female <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimps,</b> Litopenaeus vannamei, as indicated by levels of feeding and swimming.|$|R
40|$|Acute hepatopancreatic {{necrosis}} disease (AHPND), formerly called early mortality syndrome (EMS), {{was first}} reported in 2010 among penaeid shrimps cultivated in the Mekong Delta Region of Viet Nam albeit without any laboratory confirmation. The disease subsequently spread {{to a wide}} range of shrimp production areas in the same region (Soc Trang: 1, 719 ha; Bac Lieu: 346 ha; and Ca Mau: 3, 493 ha), so that the Government of Viet Nam requested for technical assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations in 2011. In 2012, FAO supported Viet Nam through the project TCP/VIE/ 3304 Emergency assistance to control the spread of an unknown disease affecting shrimps in Viet Nam, under which the Department of Animal Health of Viet Nam (DAH) collaborated with the University of Arizona and FAO experts to carry out indepth studies to identify the etiologic agent of the disease. As a result, unique isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was identified as the causative agent of AHPND in 2013. Viet Nam has been vigilant and transparent with regard to aquatic animal diseases through official notifications to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA). AHPND outbreaks have no clear temporal pattern with black tiger (Penaeus monodon) and <b>whiteleg</b> (P. vannamei) <b>shrimps</b> showing similar incidence risk. The disease occurs at any stage of shrimp cultivation, i. e. on average about 35 days after stocking. To date, unwarranted outbreaks of AHPND in major shrimp-producing provinces in Viet Nam have been apparently regulated. Aside from AHPND, white spot disease (WSD) has also been a persistent problem responsible for serious economic losses in many shrimp-producing areas in Viet Nam. To prevent and control the further spread of infectious diseases of shrimps including AHPND and WSD, multiple control measures have been implemented including guidance of farmers to improve production conditions, facilities and biosecurity application, active surveillance of shrimp production areas for early warning, screening of broodstock and postlarvae for any OIE listed diseases, regulation on movement of stocks, and collaboration with regional and international organizations in carrying out in-depth epidemiological studies that will be needed in the formulation of pragmatic and holistic disease interventions...|$|R

30|$|<b>Whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Litopenaeus vannamei, is {{the most}} {{globally}} cultured shrimp species.

30|$|Haemolymph {{metabolites}} in crustaceans {{represent the}} physiological, nutritional and immunological stress indicators (Becerra-Dorame et al. 2012). In this study, plasma protein was higher in lower substitute level of SBM which means high FM containing diet resulted in high total protein content in haemolymph of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{and this was}} according to the results obtained by Rosas et al. (2000). Furthermore, in the present study, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels have decreasing trend among the dietary treatments. In other studies, same decreasing trend of cholesterol was found in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Kaushik et al. 1995) and gilthead sea bream, Sparus aurata (Venou et al. 2006) due to inclusion of SBM in the diet. This might have happened because of the hypocholesterolemic effect of SBM (Davis and Morris 1997; Yue et al. 2012). The plasma glucose levels in <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> increased with increasing substitute level of SBM among the experimental diets. These results are probably related to higher inclusion level of plant protein (SBM) in the diet, which is definitely followed by the increment of carbohydrate source in the diet.|$|E

For species related to the seaweed investigated in the present study, Ulva clathrata improved growth of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> by 107 – 164  % (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011), U. intestinalis improved growth of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> and giant tiger prawns (without specific data) (Limsuwan et al. 2008), and Chaetomorpha ligustica increased SGR of giant tiger prawns by up to 157  % at the early juvenile stage (Tsutsui et al. 2010). Although direct comparisons with the studies cited above cannot be made because of differences in co-cultured species, our {{results suggest that the}} Chaetomorpha sp. is able to improve shrimp growth by almost the same amount as that of the other filamentous green seaweeds under co-culture conditions.|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture {{provides}} our rising {{global population}} {{a multitude of}} social, economic, and ecological benefits. A large component of the yields is <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Litopenaeus vannamei), which has expanded to over three million tons annual global production. As <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> tolerate {{a wide range of}} salinities, a potential method to reduce impacts is freshwater inland culture, which would decrease operational and environmental costs. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such a proposal via a long-term analysis of shrimp growth and survival in freshwater, compared to brackish or saltwater (0, 12, and 35 ppt, respectively) over a 107 day period. Based on findings of previous studies, I hypothesized equal shrimp growth and survival among treatments. Growth, survival, and biomass results in freshwater were poor compared to higher salinities (0. 063 g/wk compared to 0. 62 and 0. 091 g/wk growth, 1 % versus 63 and 72 % survival, and 2 g versus 307 and 1747 g final biomass, respectively). This study confirmed that many factors are vital to the successful culture of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Multiple regression demonstrated that water quality variables (salinity, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH) were significantly correlated with dependent variables (shrimp growth, survival, and biomass) to varying degrees. Growth was negatively associated with salinity and pH, and positively associated with alkalinity and DO. Survival was positively associated with alkalinity and pH, and negatively with ammonia, while biomass had a significant positive association with DO. Growth was the sole dependent variable with a significant association with salinity. Growing shrimp was most effective in brackish water under the conditions of the present experiment, but continued research on identifying drivers of this limitation are worthwhile in order to make the valuable shrimp farming industry as sustainable as possible...|$|E
30|$|Almost all {{filamentous}} green seaweeds {{currently used}} for growth enhancement of aquaculture species as raw or dried dietary feed {{are from the}} genus Ulva; species used for this application include U. clathrata for <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp,</b> (Cruz-Suárez et al. 2010; Gamboa-Delgado et al. 2011), U. intestinalis for <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Limsuwan et al. 2008), U. intestinalis for spotted scat, red tilapia, and giant gourami (Siddik and Anh 2015), U. rigida for Nile tilapia (Ergün et al. 2009), and Ulva sp. for Nile tilapia (Siddik et al. 2014).

The Chaetomorpha sp. investigated in this study has a wider salinity tolerance range than Ulva species; Chaetomorpha sp. can grow in salinities of 0.2 – 80 PSU and has a high growth rate maximum of < 60  % day− 1 (Tsutsui et al. 2015). Therefore, Chaetomorpha sp. may be better and more suitable than Ulva species in intensive shrimp aquaculture ponds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Litopenaeus vannamei {{is one of}} {{the most}} commercially farmed species {{worldwide}} because of its fast growth, good survival rate at high farming densities, and osmoregulatory capacity, which makes it an excellent candidate for cultures at different salinities. The knowledge of shrimp nutritional requirements is critical in the formulation of diets to allow optimal growth at different environmental conditions and development stages. The effect of salinity on apparent digestibility of shrimp feed is not well known, and this information is required in shrimp diet formulation. For this purpose, the apparent digestibility coefficients of carbohydrates (ACD) and lipids (ALD) were determined for juvenile whiteleg shrimps under controlled culture conditions. We evaluated the apparent digestibility of six commercial (D 1 : 37 CP, D 2 : 38 CP, D 3 : 39 CP, D 4 : 34 CP, D 5 : 35 CP, and D 6 : 37 CP) and two experimental (E 1 : 33 CP and E 2 : 33 CP) diets for juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> cultivated at three salinities (5, 35 and 50 psu) in 60 L aquariums. ACD and ALD were determined in vivo using chromic oxide as an inert marker. Our results showed that ALD in most cases was over 80 %, independent of salinity, except the E 1 : 33 CPdiet which had 74. 0 % at 50 psu. Diet D 3 : 39 CP showed the highest ALD coefficient (90. 1 and 90. 6 % at 5 and 35 psu, respectively). For ACD, differences were detected between commercial and experimental diets at every salinity level, although salinity effect on ACD was not significant. Diet D 4 : 34 CP had the highest coefficient (92. 4 %) at 5 psu, and E 2 : 33 CP at 35 and 50 psu (97. 3 and 94. 7 %).

30|$|Trypsin is a {{protease}} {{enzyme that}} is excreted by the pancreas and plays a great {{role in the}} digestion of proteins (Erlanger et al. 1961). The {{results of the present}} study showed that the 100 % replacement level of FM, with no regard to the inclusion of amino acids, had negative effects on the activity of trypsin. This might be related to the trypsin inhibitory properties of SBM (Francis et al. 2001). There are several natural trypsin inhibitors, also known as serine protease inhibitors, and SBM is one of the most important ones. SBM controls the activation and catabolism of proteins by the inhibition of serine proteases (Silverman et al. 2001). Thus, at 100 % replacement level, SBM will act as trypsin inhibitor for juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Previously, it was shown that biofloc contain several extracellular enzymes such as protease and amylase (Yu et al. 2009). The extracellular enzymes that are synthesized by the microorganisms attached to the biofloc would release to the digestive tract of the host organism after being ingested. These enzymes would take part along with the total enzymes activities of the body. In addition, the bioactive compounds present in the biofloc may possibly improve digestive enzyme activities of the shrimp (Xu et al. 2012). Observation with the trypsin activity suggested an improved efficiency of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> to digest SBM diet reared in biofloc system as compared to those shrimp reared in clear water fed diets with 100 % FM. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that functions by removing damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the cell. The mechanism is by catalyzing the segregation of the superoxide (O 2 −) radicals to ordinary molecules such as oxygen or hydrogen peroxide (Fattman et al. 2003; Lin et al. 2010). In the present study, SOD activity was reduced when the FM substitution level exceeded 33 % of diet. The results of this study demonstrated that shrimp fed diets with up to 33 % replacement level were in better physiological and health condition compared to higher inclusion rates. In conclusion, this study showed that up to 33 % FM in the diets of juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> reared in biofloc system could be replaced by SBM with or without supplementation of methionine and lysine.|$|E
30|$|As a {{plant protein}} source, SBM {{is widely used}} as a partial or {{complete}} substitute for animal protein (Hertrampf and Pascual 2000). Several nutritionists have investigated the feasibility of SBM in aquafeeds, {{and the results are}} contradictory, because the levels of SBM that can be used without causing growth reduction are highly species-specific and influenced by culture systems (Yue et al. 2012). For instance, Markey (2007) reported that 58 % of SBM is being used in grow out culture of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp.</b> Lim and Dominy (1990) demonstrated that 40 % level of a marine mixed protein could be replaced by solvent extracted SBM, whereas higher levels exerted reduced growth performance of L. vannamei. It was also reported that 80 % FM could be replaced by co-extruded soybean and poultry by-product meal supplemented with egg in indoor recirculating water system (Davis and Arnold 2000). Likewise, other researchers suggested different inclusion levels of FM in the diet of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> culture in different conditions (Samocha et al. 2004 a; Browdy et al. 2006; Patnaik et al. 2006; Amaya et al. 2007). This is while in marine shrimp diets, higher levels of dietary SBM usually resulted in lower growth (Akiyama 1990; Floreto et al. 2000). Likewise, Yue et al. (2012) suggested that FM inclusion can be reduced to approximately 200  g kg− 1 diet of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> when SBM and peanut meal are included instead. Reduced growth performance and increased FCR in L. vannamei fed different diets that gradually replace FM by SBM could be because of anti-nutritional factors, such as saponins, phytoestrogens, allergens, phytate (myo-inositol- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexakisphosphate), protease inhibitors, trypsin inhibitors, lectins and antivitamins (Francis et al. 2001). For example, trypsin inhibitors and lectins prevent the proper activity of digestive enzymes (Gemede and Ratta 2014). The other limitation in application of SBM in fish diet is the improper amino acid composition that does not meet the nutritional requirements of fish (Floreto et al. 2000). In addition, n- 3 lipid composition of SBM is much lower comparing to FM, and thus high inclusion levels of SBM in the diet may result in reduced growth performance (Sharawya et al. 2016).|$|E

We have characterized the toxin genes of VP AHPND strains and also constructed a recombinant plasmid (broad host range) carrying PirAB-like toxin genes. Non-VP AHPND strain N 7 which does not carry the plasmid and strain FP 11 which is carrying a plasmid not coding for the toxin genes were transformed with the plasmid carrying PirAB-like toxin genes. As a result, the transformed N 7 and FP 11 strains became virulent and killed <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Penaeus vannamei) similar to or at par with the virulence of VP AHPND strain. We then fed the <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> with commercial feed containing the formalin-killed VP AHPND strain. After 2 days of feeding, all of the <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> died. These results clearly indicate that the PirAB-like toxin is the virulence factor of VP AHPND. We have been investigating the virulence mechanism of the PirAB-like toxin produced by VP AHPND strains. First, we calculated the copy number of plasmid encoding the PirAB-like toxin genes of several VP AHPND strains. The copy number of the plasmid varied, ranging from 1 to 36 copies. Interestingly, VP AHPND strains carrying low copy number of plasmid were more virulent than VP AHPND strains carrying high copy number of the plasmid. These results imply that the copy number of toxin genes is not an important factor responsible for the degree of virulence of the VP AHPND strains. We are also studying other factors associated with the virulence of PirAB-like toxin. Likewise, we are developing prevention methods against AHPND including the use of formalin-killed cell vaccine, IgY additive in feed, and nano-bubble treatment of rearing water.

30|$|Different {{levels of}} dietary soybean meal (SBM) as a fish meal (FM) replacer, {{with and without}} amino acid supplementation, for <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Litopenaeus vannamei reared in the biofloc system was {{examined}} in eight weeks of feeding trial. Eight experimental diets consisted of a basal diet with 0 % FM replacement by SBM provided in clear sea water without biofloc system (S 0 SW), four diets replacing FM at 0 % (S 0), 33 % (S 33), 67 % (S 67) and 100 % (S 100) by SBM, and three diets replacing FM at 33 % (S 33 A), 67 % (S 67 A) and 100 % (S 100 A) by SBM supplemented with amino acids (methionine and lysine) in the seawater biofloc system. Results of water quality analyses showed significantly lower total suspended solids and nitrate for S 0 SW group than all other treatments. Diets S 0 and S 33 A resulted in higher weight gain and specific growth rate among all groups, with no significant differences with S 33 group. In addition, whole-body protein and amino acid compositions of shrimp fed S 0 SW were lower than most biofloc groups. Haemolymph parameters showed significant differences in total protein, cholesterol and triglyceride between groups S 0 and S 0 SW. Also, superoxide dismutase activity showed a decreasing trend with increasing replacement level. In conclusion, based on these results, SBM could replace up to 33 % of FM with or without amino acid supplementation in juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> diets reared in the biofloc system.|$|E
40|$|Bacteriosis {{is a major}} {{economic}} problem affecting the farming industry of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> Penaeus vannamei. Little information is available on Providencia rettgeri as a possible pathogen for P. vannamei. In this study, a virulent strain, here named S 6, was isolated from diseased P. vannamei, identified phenotypically, and molecularly, as P. rettgeri. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine the taxonomic position and relatedness of isolate S 6 to other P. rettgeri isolates. When screened against a range of common veterinary antibiotics, isolate S 6 exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides and sulfonamides antibiotics in aquaculture. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of P. rettgeri as a causal agent of bacteriosis in freshwater farmed P. vannamei...|$|E
40|$|Hemocytes {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important defense mechanisms against foreign material in Crustacea and are also involved in a variety of other physiological responses. Fluorescent lectin-binding assays and cytochemical reactions were used to identify specificity and distribution of carbohydrate moieties and presence of several hydrolytic enzymes, in hemocytes of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> Litopenaeus vannamei. Two general classes of circulating hemocytes (granular and agranular) exist in L. vannamei, which express carbohydrates residues for FITC-conjugated lectins WGA, LEA, and PNA; UEA and Con-A were not observed. Enzymatic studies indicated that acid phosphatase, nonspecific esterase, and specific esterases were present; alkaline phosphatase was not observed. The enzymes and carbohydrates are useful tools in hemocyte classification and cellular defense mechanism studies...|$|E
30|$|The {{feeding trial}} {{was carried out}} at the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI), Taean, Republic of Korea. The shrimp {{used in this study}} were {{produced}} from specific pathogen free (SPF) L. vannamei broodstock imported from Hawaii, USA. Prior {{to the start of the}} feeding trial, juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> were kept in indoor fiberglass tank (6  m 2, 5  t) containing aerated clean water for a period of 7  days at 28.3  ±  1.7  °C. In this period, shrimp were fed a commercial feed (DongA One, Busan, Republic of Korea), two time per day. At the beginning of the feeding trial, a total of 1320 juvenile <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> (average initial weight 0.9  ±  0.05  g) were carefully selected from the stock tank and directly distributed into 24 fiberglass tanks with a water volume of 200  L each (55 shrimp for each tank). Eight groups of shrimp were fed using each of the formulated diets. The feeding rate was 7 % of body weight per day at beginning of experiment that gradually deceased to 5 % at the end of experiment. After every 2  weeks, total weight in each tank was measured and daily feed was equally divided into four parts and given at 09 : 00, 13 : 00, 17 : 00 and 21 : 00 to all of the tanks. During 8  weeks of the feeding trial, biofloc was supplied from the stock tanks at the NFRDI and aeration for all tanks was applied using air-stones that were connected to an air pump (Resun LP- 60 Pond Air Pump, China), and 20 % of the water was exchanged daily in all the biofloc and clear water tanks.|$|E
3000|$|During this experiment, {{water quality}} {{parameters}} in biofloc system were in favorable condition {{and had no}} significant effect on survival of <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp.</b> However, significant differences were observed {{in the amount of}} total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate (NO 3 - [...]) between clear water and biofloc system. Changes in the amount of TSS in culture water, over time, shows the development of the system. Hence, TSS is considered to be an indicator for quantitative evaluation of culture system (De Schryver et al. 2008). It has been reported that the optimal amount of TSS for shrimp culture is approximately between 200 and 400  mg L− 1 (Plínio et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2016) and further increases in TSS level could cause gill irritation of organisms and biological oxygen demand (BOD) creates more stresses in shrimp (Beveridge et al. 1991; Hargreaves 2006; Brune et al. 2003; Ray et al. 2010), whereas lower amounts of TSS could cause growth reduction of shrimp (Samocha et al. 2004 a; Ekasari et al. 2016). Proper management of TSS level could be useful for both shrimp and biofloc system (Cohen et al. 2005; Ebeling et al. 2006; De Schryver et al. 2008; Ray et al. 2010). In our experiment, nitrate, nitrite and TAN were in safe levels for <b>whiteleg</b> <b>shrimp</b> culture that is in accordance with findings of Van Wyk and Scarpa (1999). Nitrate is the final compound in the nitrification process, although it is not highly toxic for shrimp, it is recommended to be kept lower than 100  mg L− 1 in culture water. Higher amounts of nitrate could cause stress for shrimp and reduce the growth (Plínio et al. 2015; Samocha et al. 2004 a, b). These results suggest that by application of biofloc system for shrimp culture the water quality parameters could be effectively controlled in a more favorable trend (Xu et al. 2016).|$|E
