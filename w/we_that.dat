2500|$|With {{the end of}} the 1746–1747 season, Fleetwoods' {{patent on}} Drury Lane expired in {{partnership}} with James Lacy, Garrick took over the theatre in April 1747. The theatre had been in a decline for some years, but the partnership of Garrick and Lacy led to success and accolades. The first performance under Garrick and Lacy's management opened with an Ode to Drury Lane Theatre, on dedicating a Building and erecting a Statue, to Shakespeare read by Garrick and written by his friend, Dr. Johnson. The ode promised the patrons that [...] "The drama's law the drama's patrons give,/For <b>we</b> <b>that</b> live to please must please to live." [...] Certainly this statement could be regarded as succinctly summing up Garrick's management at Drury Lane where he was able to balance both artistic integrity and the fickle tastes of the public.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell began Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) some {{eight months}} after he read We in a French {{translation}} and wrote a review of it. Orwell is reported as [...] "saying that he was taking it {{as the model for}} his next novel". Brown writes that for Orwell and certain others, We [...] "appears to have been the crucial literary experience". Shane states that [...] "Zamyatin's influence on Orwell is beyond dispute". Robert Russell, in an overview of the criticism of We, concludes that [...] "1984 shares so many features with <b>We</b> <b>that</b> {{there can be no doubt}} about its general debt to it", however there is a minority of critics who view the similarities between We and 1984 as [...] "entirely superficial". Further, Russell finds that [...] "Orwell's novel is both bleaker and more topical than Zamyatin's, lacking entirely that ironic humour that pervades the Russian work".|$|E
2500|$|Hitch carved the {{alabaster}} reredos at St Mary's Church in Streatley to John Loughborough Pearson's design. He executed {{the work}} in 1893. [...] The central panel shows the Crucifixion and {{on the left side}} of this is a scene from our Lord's childhood and on the right side the Resurrection. Between the panels and on either side are smaller statuettes, the four outer ones being the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. A statuette on the north side of the central panel is of Aaron and on the south side is Elias, the two representing priests and prophets. The reredos was erected in memory of Mrs. Stone, the then lady of the manor, and funded by the Stone family. Streatley and its neighbour Goring are pleasing little Oxfordshire villages and Streatley featured in Jerome K. Jerome's [...] "Three Men in a Boat." [...] Laurence Binyon the poet who wrote [...] "For the Fallen" [...] :"They shall grow not old, as <b>we</b> <b>that</b> are left grow old." [...] lived in the Parish and Richard Adams wrote [...] "Watership Down" [...] when living in Streatley. Adams and his family were worshippers at St Mary. Photographs of the reredos are shown here and a full photograph of the reredos can be seen on the church’s website.|$|E

2500|$|Wesley's {{attitude}} toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry" [...] {{he observed that}} a speech of Satan's in Paradise Lost is nearly equalled in Dryden's State of Innocence. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's King Arthur with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized as well as <b>we</b> <b>that</b> the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the Epistle to a Friend he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit—in the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment. Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as [...] described in the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry", is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's {{had appeared in the}} essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June 1693.|$|E
