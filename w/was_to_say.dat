25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding her arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was in his workshop, while Andersen <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist monks {{traditionally}} {{were called}} upon to perform a number of functions in Cambodian life. They participated in all formal village festivals, ceremonies, marriages, and funerals. They also might have participated in ceremonies to name infants and in other minor ceremonies or rites of passage. Monks did not lead the ceremonies, however, because that role {{was given to the}} achar, or master of ceremonies; the monk's major function <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> prayers of blessing. They were often healers and, in traditional Khmer culture, they were the practitioners whose role was closest to that of modern psychiatrists. They might also have been skilled in astrology. The monk traditionally occupied a unique position in the transmission of Khmer culture and values. By his way of life, he provided a living model of the most meritorious behavior a Buddhist could follow. He also provided the laity with many opportunities for gaining merit. For centuries monks were the only literate people residing in rural communities; they acted as teachers to temple servants, to novices, and to newly ordained monks. Until the 1970s, most literate Cambodian males gained literacy solely through the instruction of the sangha.|$|E
25|$|When Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in 1933, Meitner was still acting as head of the physics {{department}} of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. Although she was protected by her Austrian citizenship, all other Jewish scientists, including Szilárd, Fritz Haber, her nephew Otto Frisch, and many other eminent figures, were dismissed or forced to resign from their posts. Most of them emigrated from Germany. Her response <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing and bury herself in her work. After the Anschluss in March 1938, her situation became difficult. On July 13, 1938, Meitner, with the support of Otto Hahn and the help from the Dutch physicists Dirk Coster and Adriaan Fokker, departed for the Netherlands. She was forced to travel under cover to the Dutch border, where Coster persuaded German immigration officers that she had permission to travel to the Netherlands. She reached safety, though without her possessions. Meitner later said that she left Germany forever with 10 marks in her purse. Before she left, Otto Hahn had given her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother: this was to be used to bribe the frontier guards if required. It was not required, and Meitner's nephew's wife later wore it.|$|E

500|$|The {{shooting}} wrapped on October 27, 1986, both on-time and on-budget. No {{one on the}} team, however, {{liked the}} rough cut that was put together, and Vestron executives were convinced the film {{was going to be}} a flop. Thirty-nine percent of people who viewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot. In May 1987, the film was screened for producer Aaron Russo. According to Vestron executive Mitchell Cannold, Russo's reaction at the end <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> simply, [...] "Burn the negative, and collect the insurance." ...|$|E

Tubb had contributed a great deal of material to the magazine under various pseudonyms, often amounting to more than half of an issue's fiction, and he later recalled that Campbell's way of hiring him as editor <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him, [...] "As you're practically writing it, you may as well edit it." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{resolution}} {{had been}} the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue was {{the sense in which}} the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the [...] "states" [...] were parties to the federal Constitution, the referent of the word [...] "state" [...] was the sovereign people of the particular state. [...] Thus, to say that [...] "the state of Virginia ratified the Constitution" [...] <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the sovereign people of Virginia ratified the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.|$|E

Reilly, in announcing the renewal, stated that [...] "Fringe is a remarkably creative series that has set the bar as one of television's most imaginative dramas. Bringing it back for a final 13 allows us to provide the climactic conclusion that its passionate and loyal fans deserve". The writing team crafted {{an idea for a}} cohesive story-driven set of thirteen episodes as a means to complete the series, and to [...] "honor the audience that had served us so well <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a proper farewell", according to Roth.

500|$|Shepard's {{congregation}} {{encouraged him}} {{to become involved in}} secular politics, and he held several offices over his lifetime. Running {{as a member of the}} Democratic Party, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1934 as one of three members from the 18th district, along with fellow Democrats Joseph Ominsky and John J. Finnerty. (House members at that time were chosen from multimember districts.) While in the legislature, he co-sponsored a bill that would have banned racial discrimination in state contracting. Shepard was chosen to offer a prayer at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Philadelphia that year. The sight of a black minister on the podium led Ellison D. Smith, a segregationist Senator representing South Carolina, to storm out of the convention. Shepard's response to the incident <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "it was just a sign the good brother needs more prayer." ...|$|E

[...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert <b>was,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it mildly, disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E
500|$|The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{office was}} located in the same building, and Bakshi spoke to then-president Dan Melnick. [...] "I thought he would {{understand}} what The Rings meant, because UA did not." [...] Bakshi and Melnick {{made a deal with}} Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. [...] "The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out." [...] However, after Melnick was fired from MGM, the deal fell through. Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance Fritz the Cat) to ask him to produce The Lord of the Rings, and Zaentz agreed. Before the production started, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, [...] "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book.

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
