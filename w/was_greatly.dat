His successor, Harold Taylor, was Cooke's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach; however, he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons.|$|E

The number of scholarships <b>was</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.
