5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations {{three times a}} night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaur mania was {{exemplified}} by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, both of whom raced {{to be the first}} to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while Marsh's is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.|$|E

25|$|Tying the Series at a game a piece, Eagle's ace Masahiro Tanaka {{earned a}} victory in Game 2 by {{striking}} out 12 in his complete game performance. The game's first run came with Ginji Akaminai's RBI single for the Eagles in the sixth inning. In {{the bottom of the}} next inning, with runners on first and third, Kazuya Fujita hit a ground ball to second base. Giants' second baseman Takayuki Terauchi fielded the ball and threw it to first base in an attempt to throw out a head-first-sliding Fujita. First base umpire Kenjiro Mori called Fujita safe, however replays showed that he should have been out as the ball reached the base first. Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara came onto the field to argue the call with Mori but the call stood. Mori's blown call was exaggerated when Terauchi hit <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a game-tying solo home run the next inning.|$|E

25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils {{down some of the}} hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.|$|E
25|$|It {{emerged during}} the {{cross-examination}} of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that the police scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit. While two errors {{had been found in}} the history of DNA testing at Cellmark, one of the testing laboratories, in 1988 and 1989, the errors were found during quality control tests and had not occurred since. One of the companies hired for DNA consulting by Simpson's defense had made the same error as found in 1988. <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the prosecution's strong point became their weak link, amid defense accusations that police technicians handled the blood samples with such a degree of incompetence as to render the delivery of accurate and reliable DNA results almost impossible. The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.|$|E

500|$|Macdonald, {{a member}} of Beadle's ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British {{government}} had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging economic war against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same.

Since Britain {{was in a state of}} economic war against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it.
