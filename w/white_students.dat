Oklahoma was awarded statehood in 1907, with a constitution that enshrined racial segregation (Jim Crow laws). In 1911 the local school had 555 <b>white</b> <b>students</b> and one black.|$|E
5|$|Following graduation, Brown {{sought to}} enroll in a college outside of the South. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done, however, he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, had done. Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with <b>white</b> <b>students.</b>|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v.

Although agitation {{for an end to}} racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a revised}} version of the Situation Attitude Scale (W. Sedlacek and G.

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was {{used to analyze the}} data, scale responses of 59 student affairs professionals. Results indicated that the attitudes of <b>White</b> <b>student</b> affairs practitioners toward Asian Americans differed significantly from attitudes toward students whose race was not specified. A closer examination indicated significant difference for 3 of 12 scenarios.

5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and <b>white</b> <b>students</b> in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by {{the leadership of the}} Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for <b>white</b> <b>students</b> from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of <b>white</b> <b>students</b> to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E

In 1975 the student body was 39% White and 19% Hispanic. In 1981 the district had 190,000 students; 31% of the district's students were Hispanic, and 21% were White.
