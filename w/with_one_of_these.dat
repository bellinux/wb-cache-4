Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, {{dropped out of college}} and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E

25|$|The Mayan {{landscape}} is a ritual topography, with landmarks such as mountains, wells and caves being assigned to specific ancestors and deities (see also Maya cave sites).

25|$|C-21 Dragon Assault Ship {{is a large}} four-post ducted-fan VTOL {{heavily armed}} {{transport}} and gunship which can deliver AMP suits through drop doors. Quaritch led RDA forces <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> Its myriad arsenal of heavy machine guns, dozens upon dozens of rocket and missile pods, and door-gunners makes it the RDA's largest ship so far, with the Valkyrie shuttle being the only larger vehicle designed for extended use in the atmosphere of Pandora. Quad turbine generators drive the four-posted ceramic propellers. The Dragon is heavily armed with multiple weapons systems included grenades, rockets, missiles and point-defense Gatling cannons. Ability to deploy many troops and AMP suits, variety of medium automatic guns, ATG and ATA missiles, incendiary rockets, grenades, door gunners, plus dual and quad Gatling gun systems. All gun and missile systems are constrained by friendly fire avoidance codes (IFF Lockout). It has twin cockpits. Its propellers counter-rotate to navigate, plus the nose-mounted radar suite. There are eight fifty-millimeter sentry guns mounted below the right cockpit.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the number}} of Red Cross food parcels, prisoners {{sometimes}} ate better than their guards, who had to rely on Wehrmacht rations. Prisoners could use their relative luxuries for trade and, for example, exchange their cigarettes for German Reichsmarks that they hoped could later use in their escape attempts. Occasionally this turned to be a mistake as several of the bills they received were of the earlier Papiermark varieties that were no longer considered valid. There were also other currencies in circulation, including the Registermark, utilized for travelling and investments in Germany; the Reisemark, for tourists; the Kreditsperrmark, for sales of property belonging to foreigners; the Effektensperrmark, arising from the sale of securities in Germany; the Reichskreditkassenschein in occupied territories; and the Behelfszahlungsmittel (Auxiliary Payment Certificates) for the German Armed Forces. The Kreditsperrmark and Effektensperrmark were consolidated into the Handelsperrmark in 1939. Because of the massive variety of currency types and uses, in several escape attempts, escapees <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> various currencies printed before 1939 were told their money was no good — leaving them moneyless and easier to recapture.|$|E
25|$|In 1861 De Mestre first sent horses {{of his own}} from Sydney to Melbourne by steamship. He sent three {{horses to}} run in the inaugural Melbourne Cup.

Archer raced again the next day to win another 2 mile long distance race, the Melbourne Town Plate. The next year, after Archer had won the 1862 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Randwick, Sydney, de Mestre again shipped horses including Archer to Melbourne to race in the Melbourne Cup. Archer won his second Melbourne Cup by 10 lengths. Winning the Melbourne Cup twice was a feat not repeated until more than seventy years later when Peter Pan won the race in 1932 and 1934, and winning the Melbourne Cup {{two years in a row}} was a feat not repeated until more than 100 years later when Rain Lover won in 1968 and 1969.|$|E
