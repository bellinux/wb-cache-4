5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{busy with}} The Gates of Hell, Rodin won other commissions. He pursued an {{opportunity}} to create a historical monument for the town of Calais. For a monument to French author Honoré de Balzac, Rodin was chosen in 1891. His execution of both sculptures clashed with traditional tastes, and met {{with varying degrees of}} disapproval from the organizations that sponsored the commissions. Still, Rodin <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> support from diverse sources that propelled him toward fame.|$|E

Afterward, Reutimann took back the lead, holding it until Matt Kenseth passed him on lap 47. Gordon led after the final pit stops. In the final laps, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> on Gordon, but Gordon maintained his position to win. There were six cautions and twenty-eight lead changes among thirteen different drivers during the race.|$|E

5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E

The two {{saw it as}} an opportunity to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flow—a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network distribution system, and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|During 1988, {{when the}} Lithuanian {{movement}} towards independence <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> strength, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet again recognized the tricolor {{as the national}} flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Lithuanian SSR. The flag was defined as rectangular tricolor which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of Soviet flags). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 № I-10.|$|E

5|$|Prohibition <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> {{currency}} in Alberta: the Conservatives had included {{it in their}} 1913 platform, and it {{was supported by the}} increasingly powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA). The government generally opposed the idea, and Cross held up Manitoba as example of its failures. But the government had also (at the UFA's behest) introduced direct democracy measures, one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites. The well-organized temperance movement did so on prohibition, which was endorsed in the ensuing plebiscite; the legislature passed the Prohibition Act in the spring of 1916. As Attorney-General, Cross was responsible for enforcing it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa {{interfered}} by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring.

Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E

5|$|With Burgers due {{to stand}} for {{re-election}} the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured {{him that he would}} do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, and the idea of annexation <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.|$|E
5|$|After the Machtergreifung (NSDAP {{seizure of}} power) in January 1933, the relief fund was {{repurposed}} to provide general accident and property insurance, so Bormann resigned from its administration. He {{applied for a}} transfer and was accepted {{as chief of staff}} in the office of Rudolf Hess, the Deputy Führer, on 1 July 1933. Bormann also served as personal secretary to Hess from 4 July 1933 until May 1941. Hess' department was responsible for settling disputes within the party and acted as an intermediary between the party and the state regarding policy decisions and legislation. Bormann used his position to create an extensive bureaucracy and involve himself in as much of the decision-making as possible. On 10 October 1933 Hitler named Bormann Reichsleiter (national leader – the highest party rank) of the NSDAP, and in November he was named Reichstag deputy. By June 1934, Bormann <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> acceptance into Hitler's inner circle and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests.|$|E
5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E

5|$|However, David's successes were in {{many ways}} {{balanced}} by his failures. David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant {{since the death of}} Bishop Geoffrey Rufus in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time William de St Barbara was elected to the see in 1143.|$|E
5|$|In 1353, John and {{his family}} were granted Venetian citizenship, which hints that his domain was under the {{protection}} of Venice. The premature death of Stephen Dušan in 1355 plunged the Serbian Empire into civil war. In that conflict, John took the side of his wife's son-in-law Simeon Uroš against the legitimate successor Stephen Uroš, who was Stephen Dušan's son and Simeon Uroš's nephew. While Simeon's attempt at taking the throne was ill-fated and Stephen Uroš even captured Berat in 1356, John managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both Simeon and Stephen Uroš. The threat of Nikephoros II Orsini, who <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> ground in Thessaly and Epirus, forced John to request the dispatch of a Venetian warship and an administrator from Venice to take control of his domain, to which the republic obliged.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, film {{producer}} Panchu Arunachalam commissioned him to compose {{the songs and}} film score for a Tamil-language film called Annakkili ('The Parrot'). For the soundtrack, Ilaiyaraaja applied the techniques of modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil folk poetry and folk song melodies, which created a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms. Ilaiyaraaja's use of Tamil music in his film scores injected new influence into the Indian film score milieu. By the mid-1980s Ilaiyaraaja <b>was</b> <b>gaining</b> increasing stature as a film composer and music director in the South Indian film industry.
