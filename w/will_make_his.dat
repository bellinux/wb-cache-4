His {{original}} Special Moves included the Vulcan Punch (a rapid punch attack with fire effects), the Gatling Attack (a rushing series of punches), and the Super Argentine Back Breaker (in which Ralf tosses his opponent in the air and catches him).

In KOF '97, he gains the Galactica Phantom, a single but powerful punch which sends the enemy flying across the screen. In KOF 2002, he uses the Bareback Galactica Phantom as MAX2 move (a maximum level Super Special move), with an additional follow up gained in 2002 Unlimited Match which, at times, can lead to an instant kill. In KOF XIII, he gets the Jet Vulcan, a variant of the Super Vulcan Punch in which Ralf turns red with rage and unleashes a flurry of punches in front of him. In KOF XIV, he get the Ralf Super Phalanx, a combination of the Jet Vulcan and Galactica Phantom where Ralf unleashes eight punches in front of him which, if the last punch hits, <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> opponent stagger, allowing Ralf to finish off his opponent with a highly explosive straight.|$|E

500|$|In France, a Wehrmacht {{propaganda}} company frequently accompanied Rommel on his inspection {{trips to}} document {{his work for}} both domestic and foreign audiences.

500|$|Michael {{publicly}} reads all {{the outstanding}} complaints against everyone, {{even though they}} were supposed to be anonymous, which only serves to further increase office tensions.

[...] Enraged at Jim's latest prank (Jim made Dwight's new ID which was 5x7 inches, labeled Dwight as a security threat, and changed his middle name from Kurt to [...] "Fart"), Dwight becomes even more furious that his voluminous complaints against Jim have gone ignored, and tells Michael that either Jim gets fired or Dwight will quit. When Michael reads all of Jim's pranks on Dwight, Jim begins to regret how much time he has wasted at the office. Dwight taunts Jim with a notice of a Dunder-Mifflin position in Stamford, saying that Jim should look into it because Dwight will still be working in Scranton by next week. Michael surveys the angry, divided office and silently nods to a watching Toby, acknowledging his efforts were a disaster. He then defuses Dwight's anger by saying he <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> decision but needs indeterminate time to do so, which placates Dwight.|$|E

2500|$|Alex Reyes, 21, <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> first MLB {{start at}} home on August 27, while Mike Leake recovers from {{a case of the}} shingles. He turns 22 on August 29.

In 14 starts with Triple-A Memphis this season, Reyes went 2-3 with a 5.23 ERA and 1.454 WHIP. Though he {{averaged}} 12.5 strikeouts per nine innings, Reyes was often hampered by a lack of efficiency and lapses in command. Nevertheless, his repertoire—highlighted by a fastball that can reach triple digits, a curveball and changeup—makes him one of the franchise's most hyped prospects in years. Reyes ranked by MLB Pipeline as the Cardinals' No. 1 prospect and as the eighth-best prospect in baseball. Leake, who is 9-9 with a 4.56 ERA, had not previously missed a start this season.|$|E
