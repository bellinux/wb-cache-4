This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.|$|E
5|$|When Frederick III of Habsburg {{ascended to}} the throne, the Swiss {{suddenly}} faced {{a new situation}} {{in which they could}} no longer count on support from the empire. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> conflicts with the Habsburg dukes threatened to become conflicts with the empire itself. Under Frederick's reign, this did not occur yet. Frederick had sided in 1442 against the confederacy in the Old Zürich War where he had supported the city of Zürich, and he also refused to reconfirm the imperial immediacy {{of the members of the}} Confederacy. But Frederick's troubled reign did not leave room for military operations against the Swiss. In Austria, Frederick was in conflict first with his brother Albert and then faced the pressure of Matthias Corvinus, who even drove him from Vienna and forced Frederick's court to assume an itinerant lifestyle.|$|E

Congress {{eventually}} approved the Arkansas Constitution after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836 as the 25th {{state and the}} 13th slave state, having {{a population of about}} 60,000.

25|$|When the {{survivors}} of the shipwreck of the Third Supply mission's flagship Sea Venture finally arrived at Jamestown the following May 23 in two makeshift ships they had constructed while stranded on Bermuda for nine months, they found fewer than 100 colonists still alive, many of whom were sick. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> the Bermuda survivors had brought few supplies and only a small amount of food with them, expecting to find a thriving colony at Jamestown.|$|E
25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E

25|$|Baxter's health {{had grown}} even <b>worse,</b> <b>yet</b> {{this was the}} period of his {{greatest}} activity as a writer. He wrote 168 or so separate works, including major treatises such as the Christian Directory, the Methodus Theologiae Christianae, and the Catholic Theology. His Breviate of the Life of Mrs Margaret Baxter records the virtues {{of his wife and}} tenderness which otherwise might not have been known. A slim devotional work published in 1658 under the title Call to the Unconverted to Turn and Live formed one of the core extra-biblical texts of evangelicalism until at least the middle of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the {{partitioned}} data {{is to be}} preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on {{the story behind the}} data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{had some}} success {{advancing}} into Rams territory on their next two possessions, only to see the Rams intercept the ball both times. First, Rams free safety Eddie Brown stopped the ensuing Steelers drive with an interception, lateraling to Pat Thomas to gain an additional two yards. Then after a punt, Pittsburgh drove {{all the way to}} the Rams 16-yard line, but Los Angeles defensive back Rod Perry intercepted a pass intended for Stallworth. Thus, the third quarter ended with the Rams still in the lead, 19–17, seemingly in control of the game. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> Pittsburgh lost Swann to injury, when he was knocked out of the game by Pat Thomas.|$|E

25|$|Freezing rain plagued Morgan's men as they encamped at Springfield on {{the night}} of December 30. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> scouts {{reported}} a massive Union force concentrated nine miles away at Lebanon. With Frank Wolford's men moving on his position, Morgan made the difficult decision to move out just after midnight in ever-worsening weather. He ordered a few companies to create a diversion, feigning an attack on Lebanon and burning fence rails to give the appearance of campfires, while the main body of his force continued to Campbellsville. The plan worked, and following a march that many described as their most miserable night of the war, Morgan's men arrived safely in Campbellsville on New Year's Eve and captured some welcome supplies. The following day, they proceeded through Columbia, and returned to Tennessee on January 3.|$|E
25|$|When his {{reconnaissance}} parties made {{no contact}} with the enemy at the Guadalquivir, Vedel concluded that Reding had shifted his division to another point along the line. Dufour sent back alarming reports from Guarromán, convincing Vedel that 10,000 Spaniards—perhaps Reding's division, he warned—were marching on the mountains to their rear. This was too much. Gathering his exhausted division, Vedel hurried to Dufour's aid on July 17, arriving at Santa Carolina the next day. Dufour's fatal blunder was soon revealed. Vedel discovered that the small band of irregulars roaming about were {{not at all the}} threat Dufour had described; for the third time the Spaniards had stolen a march from him, and Reding still hovered somewhere around Mengibar, out of sight. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> an enormous gap now existed between Dupont and Vedel, and not a single battalion remained to prevent Reding from seizing the central position at Bailén.|$|E

500|$|Cantor was {{promoted}} to Extraordinary Professor in 1872 and made full Professor in 1879. To attain the latter rank {{at the age of}} 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a chair at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible. Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague, perceiving him as a [...] "corrupter of youth" [...] for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians. <b>Worse</b> <b>yet,</b> Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874. Kronecker, now seen as {{one of the founders of}} the constructive viewpoint in mathematics, disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and it usually involved Kronecker, so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.|$|E
