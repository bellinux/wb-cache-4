25|$|To prevent false-triggering of the {{automatic}} flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected {{for at least}} five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just <b>walks</b> <b>past</b> them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the whole time that a presence is detected.|$|E

Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew [...] "a bunch of cheap guys". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by Frank Miller's neo-noir Sin City series in particular. Pope's sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis.
