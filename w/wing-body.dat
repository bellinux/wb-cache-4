5|$|While sharing broadly the blended <b>wing-body</b> {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly {{distinguished}} from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the <b>wing-body</b> fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute. Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the <b>wing-body</b> juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

50|$|For instance, if the lift-curve {{slope of}} a <b>wing-body</b> {{combination}} is desired, the DATCOM recommends that the lift-curve {{slopes of the}} isolated wing and body, respectively, be estimated by methods presented and that appropriate <b>wing-body</b> interference factors (also presented) be applied. If wing-alone test data are available, {{it is obvious that}} these test data should be substituted in place of the estimated wing-alone characteristics in determining the lift-curve slope of the combination. Also, if test data are available on a configuration similar to a given configuration, the characteristics of the similar configuration can be corrected to those for the given configuration by judiciously using the DATCOM material.|$|E

5000|$|This {{process can}} also be {{extended}} to explore single <b>wing-body</b> aircraft designs. <b>Wing-body</b> styled aircraft can scale up their cargo much easier than the traditional ‘tube and plank’ design. Airbus utilized this approach to explore design choices in future large aircraft in 2002. [...] Their objectives, however, were slightly {{more complex than the}} original design of the software: the aircraft needs a maximized lift to drag ratio, to be longitudinally neutral (not wanting to pitch up or down while without a tail), to have a maximum angle of attack, to have a minimum cabin volume and shape, and have a maximum thickness on the outboard wings. Using three different components, they expanded their computational model to incorporate as many constraints as possible, including viscous effects. This method involves significantly more computational power.Their initial findings saved {{a lot of money in}} building and testing - since it causes supersonic flow of air, a shock wave forms on the aft part of the wing, drastically increasing drag and reducing lift. After modifying their goals to only keep the lift to drag ratio high and even out the pressure, the simulation provided a better design - showing that this tool is very adaptable to the situation at hand. The end result of this study was that Airbus had a set of airfoil designs that are suited to a very large <b>wing-body</b> aircraft. This also proved that these methods are successful at adapting to any task that they would require.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{prominent}} External design features revealed are a moderately-swept wing, with no <b>wing-body</b> blending or wing root strakes, a prominent vertical fin. The low wing sweep {{will give a}} good low-speed performance and excellent handling characteristics essential for the trainer role. The wing will also have a clean leading edge, while having high-lift devices on the trailing edge, for good runway performance. The HJT-39 will be an all-composite aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Following his {{research}} on wings, Whitcomb again turned to a possible complete supercritical aircraft, and in 1971 he published preliminary details of a near-sonic transport (NST), which he predicted could attain a relatively efficient cruise at 0.98 Mach. As with his supercritical wing efforts, he had largely developed the design in the wind tunnel, shaping his proposed model with putty and knife until the various secondary shocks created by <b>wing-body</b> intersections were muted as much as possible. Whitcomb's NST proposal was not advanced beyond his concept stage.|$|E
50|$|Faget {{felt that}} all of the {{proposed}} designs incorporated an unacceptable amount of development risk. Unlike a conventional aircraft, with separate fuselage and wings, the ILRV designs had blended <b>wing-body</b> layouts. This meant that changes in weight and balance, which are almost unavoidable during development, would require changes to the entire orbiter structure to compensate. He also felt that the poor low-speed handling of any of these layouts presented a real danger during landing. Upset by what he felt was a project that seemed to guarantee failure, he started work on his own design, and presented it as the DC-3.|$|E
50|$|The USAAF {{considered}} the L-133 {{to be too}} advanced for the time, and did not pursue the project. The experience gained with the design served Lockheed well {{in the development of}} the USAAF's first operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star. Although entering service after the war had ended, the P-80 was less advanced than the L-133. Because the USAAF didn't give the L-133 project the go-ahead, the advanced engines intended for the L-133 had long pauses in their development. The most expedient engine choice for the P-80 thus became the Allison J33, based on British centrifugal compressor designs. The P-80 was a cheap-to-build single-engine aircraft with a conventional wing and tailplane design, not using the blended <b>wing-body</b> and canard layout of the L-133.|$|E
50|$|The Lockheed L-133 was {{an exotic}} design started in 1939 which was {{proposed}} {{to be the}} first jet fighter of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during World War II. The radical design was to be powered by two axial-flow turbojets with an unusual blended <b>wing-body</b> canard design capable of 612 mph (985 km/h) in level flight. The USAAF passed on the 1942 proposal, but the effort speeded the development of the USAAF's first successful operational jet fighter, the P-80 Shooting Star which did see limited service near the end of war. The P-80 was a less radical design with a single British-based Allison J33 engine, with a conventional tail, but it retained a wing which was the same shape as the outer wing sections of the P-38 Lightning.|$|E

There, the FPM was compared with an equivalent Finite Element-based solver, which provided a standard for assessing both, the characteristics of the meshless solver and its suitability to address practical applications. Some simplifications of the FPM technique were proposed in this work to improve efficiency and reduce the performance gap with FEM. Then, grid convergence studies using a <b>wing-body</b> configuration were conducted. The results showed comparable accuracy and performance, revealing the FPM competitive with respect to its FEM counterpart. This is important because meshless techniques are often considered impractical due to the poor efficiency of the initial implementations.|$|E

50|$|Interference drag {{plays a role}} {{throughout}} the entire aircraft (e.g., nacelles, pylons, empennage) and its detrimental effect is always kept in mind by designers. Ideally, the pressure distributions on the intersecting bodies should complement each other’s pressure distribution. If one body locally displays a negative pressure coefficient, the intersecting body should have a positive pressure coefficient. In reality, however, {{this is not always}} possible. Particular geometric characteristics on aircraft often show how designers have dealt with the issue of interference drag. A prime example is the <b>wing-body</b> fairing, which smooths the sharp angle at the intersection of the wing and the fuselage. Another example is the junction between the horizontal and vertical tailplane in a T-tail. Often, an additional fairing (acorn) is positioned to reduce the added supervelocities. The position of the nacelle with respect to the wing is a third example of how interference-drag considerations dominate this geometric feature. Interference drag is considered when deciding the lateral and longitudinal placement of nacelles on the wing. If there is little vertical space available between the wing and the nacelle (due to need for ground clearance) the nacelle is usually positioned much more in front of the wing. The NACA area rule is one approach to reducing transonic interference drag.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} primarily with {{the application of}} the "area rule" to the interpretation and improvement of the drag-rise characteristics of <b>wing-body</b> combinations at transonic and moderate supersonic speeds. Consideration of the general physical nature of the flow at transonic speeds, together with comparisons of the flow fields and drag-rise characteristics for <b>wing-body</b> combinations and bodies of revolution has led to the conclusion that near the speed of sound the drag rise for a thin low-aspect-ratio <b>wing-body</b> combination is primarily dependent on the axial distribution of cross-sectional area normal to the airstream (ref. 1). (The drag rise, sometimes referred to as pressure drag, is the difference between the drag level near the speed of sound and the drag level at subsonic speeds where the drag is due primarily to skin friction.) In order to illustrate the concept, figure 1 shows a <b>wing-body</b> combination and a body of revolution. A typical cross section normal to the airstream for the <b>wing-body</b> combination is shown at AA. The cross-sectional area of the wing is wrapped around the body of revolution so that the body has the same cross-sectional area at BB. All the other cross-sectional areas of the body of revolution are the same as those for the <b>wing-body</b> combination at the same axial stations.
