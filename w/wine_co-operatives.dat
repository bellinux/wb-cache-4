40|$|This article {{examines}} the introduction of Economic Value Added (EVA) as a performance measure that South African <b>wine</b> <b>co-operatives</b> can use to determine whether value has been created for members. A detailed explanation of EVA is given, and the components of EVA are calculated. The EVA’s {{of a number of}} co-operatives have been calculated and analysed. Important trends have been identified. Recommendations have been made based on the conclusions drawn from these results. Finally, opportunities for potential improvement that could arise from using EVA as a performance measure in <b>wine</b> <b>co-operatives</b> are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the agro-food system, the {{vertical}} co-ordination {{in the form}} of co-operatives has consi­derable importance. In this paper, we present a function that synthesises the specific economic role of agricultural co-operatives. In the empirical research, we link the performance of the Por­ tuguese <b>Wine</b> <b>Co-operatives</b> (PWCs) and the skills of the human resources employed by them. The results of the multinomial legit model show that the PWCs are able to improve their perfor­ mance through the recruitment of skilled professionals in the areas of wine production, manage­ment and by delegating more decision-making powers from the Board to professional managers...|$|E
40|$|Fair {{trade and}} ethical {{sourcing}} are developing between southern and northern countries, but also within the European space. In {{the case of}} agrifood supply chains, more and more co-operatives are involved in these new trade relations, at production, trade or consumption levels. What are the issues and outlooks for the <b>wine</b> <b>co-operatives</b> ? What are the economic and sociological arguments of their involvement in ethical trade? Based on both economics and sociological approaches carried out in Languedoc (France) and Western Cape (south Africa), our paper aims at giving a general overview of this debate. Firstly, we propose to explore the different dimensions of ethic in economic activities and exchanges, analysing their recent expression in ethical trade initiatives. In {{the second part of}} the paper, we show how the first <b>wine</b> <b>co-operatives,</b> specially in Languedoc, emerged at the beginning of the 20 century, thanks to social utopia that was very close to the current values and principles of ethical trade. After the second world war, the growth of the table wine production has weakened this original ethical project. But, since the 90 s, the co-ops transitions towards quality wine production led to a diversity of local and international experiences that are in some cases very close to ethical sourcing or trading projects. In the third part, we discuss the conditions of ethical trade development in the wine cellar co-operatives and we make operational proposals. Producing or trading in the frame of a co-operative is not sufficient to claim to be dealing with ethical trade ! It requires at the same times to establish internal rules that promote equity and responsibility between members, to implement specific social projects in the local territory of the co-op, to associate these projects with ecological or patrimonial concerns, to build stable relationships with a set of (new) actors (traders, consumers, NGOs, public agency…), and to communicate clearly on the wine and its conditions of production...|$|E

40|$|No {{research}} has been done to date on Economic Value Added (EVA) as a performance measure for South African agricultural co-operatives. The main objective {{of this study is to}} calculate Economic Value Added for South African agricultural co-operatives. Further objectives are to determine whether co-operatives add value to their members’ interest, whether there exists a correlation between EVA performances over the years under review and between the individual groups of co-operatives. The study aims to determine EVA for the grain and oilseeds, wine, meat, timber, tobacco, fruit and vegetables co-operatives. The study further calculated EVA values for all the groups of co-operatives under changing beta-values to look at the sensitivity of EVA. EVA can be described as a value–based performance measure, an investment decision tool and also a performance measure reflecting the absolute amount of shareholder value created. Three basic inputs are needed in the calculation of EVA, namely return on capital earned on investments, the cost of capital for those investments and the capital invested in them. These three inputs are determined before the calculation of EVA can be applied. The values for the determination of these inputs are obtained from the income statements and balance sheets of the respective agricultural co-operatives. After the calculation of the EVA values for all the separate co-operatives, it could be concluded that no grain and oilseed co-operatives created value. There was only one wine co-operative which created value, five which improved from a negative to a positive EVA, three which had negative but improving EVA values. The rest of the <b>wine</b> <b>co-operatives</b> destroyed value. In the case of meat co-operatives three of the four co-operatives destroyed value, while the other one created value in the first (1998) and last year (2001) under review. The timber co-operatives created value, except for one of the three which destroyed value in 2000 and 2001. The tobacco co-operatives destroyed value over the four years under review. In the case of fruit and vegetable co-operatives, one co-operative created value, while the rest of the co-operatives destroyed value. All of the general co-operatives, as well as all the requisites co-operatives destroyed value. Averages for all the groups of co-operatives were calculated as well. Grain and oilseeds, wine, tobacco, general and requisites co-operatives destroyed value. The average of the meat co-operatives showed that this group destroyed value over the first three years under review, but created value in the last year. Timber, fruit and vegetable co-operatives created value over all four of the years under review. The average for all of the co-operatives showed that co-operatives, in general, destroyed value. From this study it becomes clear that no correlation exists between the EVA values calculated for the co-operatives over the four year period under review. There is no correlation between the individual groups of co-operatives either. This means that the EVA performance of co-operatives are not influenced by external factors, but depends on the effective management and decision-making within the agricultural co-operatives. By increasing and decreasing beta-values by 10 % and 20 % respectively and then recalculating EVA with these changed beta-values, the sensitivity of EVA could be determined. There were no significant changes in the EVA values after recalculating them. Most negative EVA values stayed negative and the positive EVA values stayed positive after recalculating EVA. It can be said that EVA is not very sensitive to the changing betas. Dissertation (MSc (Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

As such, they trace their origins to the Earls of Neipperg and the Counts of Gemmingen, both of whom owed {{a quarter of the}} town from the Middle Ages until the 18th century. The Gemminger Kelter was recently modernised and converted into business premises and living accommodation. The exterior of the Neipperger Kelter is yet to be restored and houses the social section of a local sports club. The two other wine cellars (Sachsenheim and Liebenstein) were demolished when the cellar of the local <b>wine</b> <b>co-operative</b> was built in 1949. The latter has a clock tower bearing the arms of the four former ruling families, but has since been converted into a supermarket.|$|R

40|$|Wine {{production}} in Germany has {{a tradition of}} more than 200 years in each of the 13 German quality wine-growing regions. Even today mall grape growers dominate the industry. As a result, most of the viticulturists are members of cooperatives. Our observation that grape growers still turn to wine co-ops, and hence, the increase in co-op members and vineyards, might indicate that the wine co-ops are successful. Thus, the aim of our paper is two-fold. First, we analyze the structure of this complex sector and the managerial construct strategic member groups. Second, we empirically test whether the formation of strategic groups is a driver of cooperative success. <b>wine</b> market, Germany, <b>co-operatives,</b> globalization, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization,...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{introduce}} what is traditionally known in France as the wine filière. The paper is divided into two parts. First, we will introduce the theoretical approaches and the main research questions relating to the ‘filière analysis', by combining older references with the complementary approaches derived from more recent theoretical contributions. The filière analysis is based on three main historical theoretical streams and on four complementary and more recent approaches: the innovation chains, the global value chain (GVC), the theory of transaction costs and the marketing approach. In the second part of the paper, we will provide a general overview of the wine filière and conduct an analysis of the main actors, grape growers, <b>co-operatives,</b> <b>wine</b> brokers, wine merchants and clusters according to the research questions introduced previously...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{explores the}} value and use of Concept Maps in the {{alignment}} process of the strategic intent of a business. The success of strategy is often determined by a leader’s ability to translate sophisticated strategic intent into simple, actionable language and to cascade this to every level in the organization to ensure alignment. To determine {{the success of the}} communication and level of alignment between the various hierarchical levels with regard to vision, mission and strategic objectives, concept maps were used. Five case studies are presented where a computer-based concept-mapping tool, CmapTools, was applied for the visual representation and measurement of strategic alignment amongst three hierarchical levels (CEO, Executive team and Employees) of <b>co-operative</b> <b>wine</b> cellars in the Paarl district of South Africa. The results of the empirical research clearly indicated a serious misalignment of strategic intent amongst all hierarchical levels and amongst each section of strategic intent. Concept maps and CmapTools proved to be invaluable tools to determine the degree of alignment with regard to strategic intent. ...|$|R
25|$|The early 20th century {{brought a}} period of much {{political}} and domestic instability in Portugal, continuing until the ascension of António de Oliveira Salazar as dictator of the Estado Novo or Second Republic of Portugal. During Salazar's 40-year reign, the entire Portuguese wine industry was revamped beginning with {{the founding of the}} Junta Nacional do Vinhos (JNV) in 1937. The JNV encouraged the consolidation of small vineyard landowners into <b>co-operative</b> <b>wine</b> producers. While the rise of co-operatives brought more order and structure to the Portuguese wine industry, it also had the negative effect of curbing creativity and free enterprise. As co-operatives rose to nearly absolute power in several wine regions, the winemaking and hygiene standards of some of the more lax co-operatives declined, which cast a pale reputation on the whole of the Portuguese wine industry. The lone bright spot during this period was the international success of a style of mass-produced, sweet, slightly sparkling rosés that came out of Portugal. Following World War II, brands such as Mateus and Lancer marketed this style of wine to great success in British supermarkets and around the globe. Outside port, these wines also came to be readily associated with Portuguese wine.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the local}} French work in the {{vineyards}} which provide grapes for the <b>wine</b> producing <b>co-operatives</b> at Montlaur and Monze, the one at Serviès having merged in 2006 with that at Fabrezan. In this respect life has hardly changed since the French Revolution, except for the introduction of farm machinery and other improvements which have been {{made possible by the}} EU's Common Agricultural Policy.The closure of the independent Serviès co-operative in 2006 coincided with the beginnings of a radical change in the appearance of the valley, as a large number of vineyards have been, and continue to be grubbed up to be replaced, mainly by cereal crops, most commonly barley and rye. The consequent reduction in the percentage of local land under vines, as well as altering the appearance of the landscape, will have a fundamental effect on the local economy.Economic change has been brought about by a combination of factors, mainly concerning a loss of wine markets, and time alone will tell how climatic change will exacerbate this change and how local farmers will attempt to cope with it.The declining state of local wine production, particularly that based on local co-operatives, has led to a change of policy by the Regional Authorities of Languedoc Roussillon, and a conscious attempt by them to encourage and develop tourism in the area. This is very largely in its infancy, although there is an increasing amount of accommodation available in, and particularly near the valley in nearby Carcassonne, Lagrasse, Lézignan-Corbières and Narbonne, and local hotels and restaurants are being encouraged to remain open throughout the year. However in the valley itself there are few of these, and only time will tell if there are any developments within the service sector to attract tourists in future years.In addition to the influx of non-French residents, some local houses provide second homes for French families, so that in most villages there is a tendency towards a falling percentage of permanent residents. This brings its own changes in terms of lowering levels of viability for schools, bars, shops, etc., and {{this is all part of}} the current economic transformation of the valley.|$|R
