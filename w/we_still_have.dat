5|$|The discography of Snow Patrol, an {{alternative}} rock band from Northern Ireland and based in Dundee, Scotland, consists of six studio albums, twenty-eight singles, eight extended plays, two compilation albums and one live DVD. Snow Patrol {{was formed in}} 1994 by Gary Lightbody, Michael Morrison and Mark McClelland under the name Shrug. They released an extended play (EP) titled The Yogurt vs. Yogurt Debate. Morrison left in 1995, and the band changed their name to Polarbear. Under this name they released their other EP, Starfighter Pilot, on the Electric Honey label. Drummer Jonny Quinn joined in 1997 and the band signed to Jeepster Records the same year. They then underwent their final name change to Snow Patrol. The band's first two studio albums: Songs for Polarbears and When It's All Over <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Have</b> to Clear Up were released in 1998 and 2001 respectively, but failed to do well commercially. Subsequently, the band was dropped by the label.|$|E

25|$|An infinite-dimensional {{version of}} an inner product space is a Hilbert space, and {{we can no longer}} speak of {{matrices}}. However, matrices are merely representations of linear operators, and these <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have.</b> So, generalizing both the matrix mapping and the complex plane mapping, we may define a Cayley transform of operators.|$|E

Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to clarify how ALUSIM could be implemented technically in Switzerland, whether the apprentices considered the test authentic and whether they were able to manage the technical aspects of the test.|$|R
25|$|Using this criterion, one {{can show}} that Q is an {{injective}} abelian group (i.e. an injective module over Z). More generally, an abelian group is injective {{if and only if}} it is divisible. More generally still: a module over a principal ideal domain is injective if and only if it is divisible (the case of vector spaces is an example of this theorem, as every field is a principal ideal domain and every vector space is divisible). Over a general integral domain, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> one implication: every injective module over an integral domain is divisible.|$|E
25|$|The band {{were founded}} at the University of Dundee in 1993 by Lightbody, Michael Morrison, and Mark McClelland as Shrug. After briefly {{using the name}} Polarbear and {{released}} the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Their first two studio albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It's All Over <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Have</b> to Clear Up (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent record label Jeepster Records. The band then signed to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Society {{president}} Cleveland Evans {{stated the}} reason for the organization's selection of plutoed: [...] "Our members believe the great emotional reaction of the public to the demotion of Pluto shows the importance of Pluto as a name. We may no longer believe in the Roman god Pluto, but <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a sense of connection with the former planet".|$|E
500|$|Asked in November 2008 {{what the}} current status of the new album was, bassist Rex Brown told Billboard.com that Down had been [...] "writing {{constantly}} on the road. <b>We</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> all these ideas, and we play a lot of new stuff at sound check, just to feel it out.

5000|$|I {{always thought}} TB Sheets {{was a sort}} of one-off {{inspiration}} of Van Morrison's, but in fact, it's part of a long blues tradition. A wonderful Ottawa-area DJ named Brian Murphy, who used to do a roots show at a local rock station back when <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> such things, once played a whole series of TB-sheets songs, ending in Morrison's.

Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien commented, [...] "There was little doubt [...] was lawful, given the 200 eyewitnesses and the circumstances that surrounded the shooting.

[...] He then sprouts a large black wing and flies into the night carrying Weiss with him.

500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the bluegrass and roots music influences, {{we really wanted to}} push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." [...] She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is [...] "our own little sound". The track [...] "The Crystal Merchant" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{also led}} the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a {{partnership}} with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995; its March 2015 report said that while [...] "There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman ... this data shows just how far <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to go." [...] The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary. However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments.|$|E

The following year, Hewson {{said that}} {{being part of}} a much larger corporation gave them research and development resources that they previously lacked and a more focused approach to marketing. She added, [...] "It took us much longer to get here than we anticipated. But <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> very big ambitions for the brand to go much farther." [...] Hewson herself has pale skin and very dark hair, wears little jewellery, and has eschewed cosmetic surgery.
