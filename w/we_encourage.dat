500|$|The cast {{included}} some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing. [...] However, Moore said that this was acceptable, as [...] "We don't shame the body, <b>we</b> <b>encourage</b> the body as something beautiful and natural, and my children bathe with me, and I walk around naked." ...|$|E

On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that <b>we</b> <b>encourage</b> them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. <b>We</b> <b>encourage</b> and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

2500|$|March 26, 2005. Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, {{but says}} [...] "the key public-health {{findings}} of this study are robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, making it the main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90000 or 150000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths.... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. <b>We</b> <b>encourage</b> Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as the main cause of death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts." ...|$|E

[...] What the Brotherhood neglected to understand is that democracy means more than simply holding elections. [...] Real democracy requires inclusiveness, compromise, respect for human and minority rights, and a commitment to the rule of law. [...] Morsi and his inner circle did not embrace any of these principles and instead chose to consolidate power and rule by fiat. [...] As a result the Egyptian people and their economy suffered greatly. It is now up to the Egyptian military to demonstrate that the new transitional government can and will govern in a transparent manner and work to return the country to democratic rule. [...] We are encouraged that a broad cross-section of Egyptians will gather to rewrite the constitution.

2500|$|An {{associate}} {{professor of sociology at}} the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) who conducted research called [...] "New Family Structures Study" [...] that looked at children in stable, long-term two parent homes compared to those in less-stable homes. An internal audit by the journal that published Regnerus’ study found his conclusions to be flawed and the American Sociological Association have condemned its results. Regnerus himself has admitted that the study doesn’t address same-sex parenting. Signed onto an amicus brief with both Allen and Price urging the Supreme Court to uphold California’s Proposition 8. Regnerus testified on March 3, 2014 that it is too early for social scientists to make far-reaching conclusions about families headed by same-sex couples. [...] "We aren't anywhere near saying there's conclusive evidence" [...] that children with same-sex parents grow up with no differences when compared to kids with heterosexual parents, he said. [...] "Until we get more evidence, we should be skeptical. ...It's prudent for the state to retain its definition of marriage to one man, one woman," [...] testified Regnerus. Christine L. Williams, chair of the sociology department at the UT-Austin, released a statement following Regnerus' testimony stating that his views [...] "do not reflect the views of the Sociology Department of The University of Texas at Austin. Nor do they reflect the views of the American Sociological Association, which takes the position that the conclusions he draws from his study of gay parenting are fundamentally flawed on conceptual and methodological grounds and that findings from Dr. Regnerus' work have been cited inappropriately in efforts to diminish the civil rights and legitimacy of LBGTQ partners and their families. <b>We</b> <b>encourage</b> society as a whole to evaluate his claims."
