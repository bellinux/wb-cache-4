60|$|LILY. I can't, because Isey {{never goes}} to sleep, if she <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've {{left the}} Pedantic--her boat will <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at ten o'clock, too--simply because I {{happened}} to meet him," [...] I replied.|$|R
60|$|In an hour more Peter {{informed}} me that the ponies were at the door, and that the Master <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the outer hall.|$|E

60|$|I {{saw that}} he <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say something; so I asked if his great work had not cost a vast {{expenditure}} of time and pains.|$|E
60|$|Why not? Don't {{you know}} that I love you? It would help me so much if I knew that you <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at home.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. He's <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{to look at}} him {{all through}} dinner. Shall I do it, and you can see what an idiot he looks? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I suggested, {{mindful that}} Eve <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You run {{down and have}} a chat with my agent. You'll find him just {{opposite}} the town hall in Bildborough. There's a car going down now." ...|$|E

60|$|I got to Valleyfield just at dusk. It was a rainy evening, and {{everything}} was slush and fog and gloom. But away up I saw the home light at Thrush Hill, and Jack <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> on the platform.|$|E
