2500|$|Emotion: Emotions are one's {{feelings}} {{in response to}} a certain situation. [...] There are six types of emotion: social emotions, counterfactual emotions, emotions generated by <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> (often manifested as anxiety), emotions generated by joy and grief (examples found in responses typically seen when a student gets a good grade, and when a person is at a funeral, respectively), thought-triggered emotions (sometimes manifested as flashbacks), and finally emotions of love and disgust. All of these emotions are considered to be unresolved. There are six features that are used to define emotions: intentional objects, valence, cognitive antecedents, physiological arousal, action tendencies, and lastly physiological expressions. These six concepts were identified by Aristotle and are still the topic of several talks.|$|E
2500|$|Janusz Zajdel. He {{became the}} second most popular Polish science fiction writer (after Stanisław Lem) until his sudden death in 1985. Zajdel's novels created the core of Polish social fiction and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and {{collapsed}} societies. [...] His heroes are desperately trying to find sense in world around them; sometimes, as in Cylinder van Troffa, they are outsiders from a different time or place, trying {{to adapt to a}} new environment. [...] The main recurring theme in his works is a comparison of the readers' gloomy, hopeless situations to <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> in a space environment if we carry totalitarian ideas and habits into space worlds: Red Space Republics or Space Labour Camps, or both. The Janusz A. Zajdel Award of Polish fandom is named after him.|$|E
2500|$|While purgatory was disputed by the reformers, the Early Patristic Theologians of the Eastern Church {{taught and}} {{believed}} in [...] "apokatastasis", {{the belief that}} all creation would be restored to the original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. St. Clement of Alexandria {{was one of the}} early church theologians who taught this view through key scriptures. Many today are discovering that the reformers did an injustice to Early Christian understandings concerning purgatorial restoration. [...] Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances. However, Lutherans have a similar doctrine of <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>happen</b> to the unevangelized in a book titled What about those who never heard. Also several Apologists of both Protestant,Universalist and Catholic backgrounds dig deeper into the subject in the book, [...] "Four Views of Hell".

2500|$|The Hulk {{is often}} viewed as a {{reaction}} to war. As well as being a reaction to the Cold War, the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised, and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction. In the Michael Nyman edited edition of The Guardian, Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the September 11 attacks. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic Heroes, claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in [...] "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist." [...] In Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics, Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: [...] "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>happen,</b> or how much our advancements in science may cost us." [...] Daniels continues, [...] "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age." ...|$|E
