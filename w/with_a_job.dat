Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a night watchman before he became a constable.

5|$|To {{art critic}} Robert Hughes, the {{painting}} represents {{the theme of}} family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian Lizabeth Cohen says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez's sister, Gladys, {{worked for}} Ernest Lawrence as a {{part-time}} secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago with him. After he completed his oral exams in 1936, Alvarez, now {{engaged to be married}} to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the Radiation Laboratory. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the University of California, Berkeley. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California. They had two children, Walter and Jean. They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.|$|E

As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E

5|$|When Oliver {{arrived in}} Adelaide he started playing for West Suburbans and {{immediately}} began to draw attention from the two largest South Australian Football League (SAFL) clubs, Norwood and Port Adelaide. South Australian businessman Edwin T. Smith was sending Oliver letters asking him to come train with Norwood whilst John Woolard, then captain of Port Adelaide who like Oliver grew up in Broken Hill, was also enquiring about his services. Before Oliver made his debut with Port Adelaide he was lined up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> shovelling furnace waste. Disgruntled, {{he spoke to the}} Musgrave brothers father who suggested he approach West Torrens and train with them, to which Oliver agreed. Port Adelaide secretary James Hodge prevented this move as Oliver had signed a contract with him shortly beforehand. Hodge later took Oliver out on a fishing trip to resolve the feud and found him a better job.|$|E
5|$|A temple needed {{many people}} to perform its rituals and support duties. Priests {{performed}} the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far {{less important than the}} king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood. In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts. Once the priesthood became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his vizier or to the priests themselves. In the latter case, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post. Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society, until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples’ resources.|$|E
