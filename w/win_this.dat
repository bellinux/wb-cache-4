5|$|In recent decades, {{pitchers}} {{have rarely}} won the award. When Justin Verlander won the AL award in 2011, {{he became the}} first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became the first starting pitcher to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.|$|E

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to <b>win</b> <b>this</b> title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|Docherty built a {{new team}} around the group of talented young players {{emerging}} from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into {{the final stages of}} the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two. In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, the following year, with another replayed <b>win,</b> <b>this</b> time over Real Madrid in Athens.|$|E

5|$|In 1959–60, the Test team {{toured the}} Indian subcontinent during the Australian summer, opening up more {{vacancies}} in the Sheffield Shield. Harvey {{was given a}} recall in December 1959. However, he was not successful and failed to convert his starts into substantial scores, making 8, 36, 12, 25, 22 and 20 in three matches. In the last of these matches, he took his career-best bowling figures of 3/26, in the first innings against South Australia. He dismissed the top-scorer John Lill for 176 and his other victims were Michael Clingly and Peter Trethewey. This allowed Victoria to take first innings points and eventually complete a six-wicket <b>win.</b> <b>This</b> meant that all of Harvey's five wickets as first-class level came against South Australia. Harvey's first-class career ended with the following match against New South Wales. He made 1 and 9, and conceded 26 runs from three wicketless overs, and was dropped, having made only 133 runs at 16.62 for the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies lived up to expectations, {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470.

The following week, against the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 <b>win.</b> <b>This</b> was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1918 Dyer {{was awarded}} a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he {{followed}} up with another <b>win</b> <b>this</b> time over Terry Brooks. At {{the start of the}} Brooks fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces.|$|E
