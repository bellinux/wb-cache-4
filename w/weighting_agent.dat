50|$|Water-based {{drilling}} mud most commonly consists of bentonite clay (gel) with additives such as barium sulfate (barite), calcium carbonate (chalk) or hematite. Various thickeners {{are used to}} influence the viscosity of the fluid, e.g. xanthan gum, guar gum, glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyanionic cellulose (PAC), or starch. In turn, deflocculants are used to reduce viscosity of clay-based muds; anionic polyelectrolytes (e.g. acrylates, polyphosphates, lignosulfonates (Lig) or tannic acid derivates such as Quebracho) are frequently used. Red mud was the name for a Quebracho-based mixture, named after {{the color of the}} red tannic acid salts; it was commonly used in the 1940s to 1950s, then was made obsolete when lignosulfonates became available. Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control loss of drilling fluids into permeable formations). A <b>weighting</b> <b>agent</b> such as barite is added to increase the overall density of the drilling fluid so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids.|$|E
5000|$|... 69-77% of baryte {{worldwide}} {{is used as}} a <b>weighting</b> <b>agent</b> for {{drilling fluids}} in oil and gas exploration to suppress high formation pressures and prevent blowouts. As a well is drilled, the bit passes through various formations, each with different characteristics. The deeper the hole, the more baryte is needed {{as a percentage of the}} total mud mix. An additional benefit of baryte is that it is non-magnetic and thus does not interfere with magnetic measurements taken in the borehole, either during logging-while-drilling or in separate drill hole logging. Baryte used for drilling petroleum wells can be black, blue, brown or gray depending on the ore body. The baryte is finely ground so that at least 97% of the material, by weight, can pass through a 200-mesh (75 μm) screen, and no more than 30%, by weight, can be less than 6 μm diameter. The ground baryte also must be dense enough so that its specific gravity is 4.2 or greater, soft enough to not damage the bearings of a tricone drill bit, chemically inert, and containing no more than 250 milligrams per kilogram of soluble alkaline salts.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{develop a}} method {{suitable}} for estimating exposure risks in population studies of asthma from job titles and international codes, by combining {{a new job}} exposure matrix (JEM) with the expert judgement approach. The method was applied in the French epidemiological study of the genetics and environment in asthma (EGEA).  METHODS—The JEM contains 22  exposure groups including 18  high risk groups based on known risk factors for occupational asthma, divided into high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>agents,</b> low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>agents,</b> and mixed environments. After applying the JEM to job codes, exposure estimates for each subject were re-evaluated by examining job title texts. Three high risk exposure estimates for asthma were compared: firstly, applying the JEM to original codes (from different coders in each study centre); secondly, applying the JEM to revised codes (from one experienced coder); and thirdly, after reviewing JEM exposure estimates {{in the light of}} job title texts.  RESULTS—The study comprised 173  cases with asthma and 285  controls (age 18 - 65). Odds ratios (ORs) for asthma for high risk jobs were 1. 0  (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 6  to 1. 7), applying the JEM to original codes; 1. 4  (95 % CI 0. 8  to 2. 3), applying the JEM to revised codes; and 1. 7  (95 % CI 1. 1  to 2. 7), applying the JEM and subsequently re-evaluating exposure estimates from job title texts. Asthma ORs were 1. 4  (95 % CI 0. 6  to 2. 9) for high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>agents,</b> 2. 3  (95 % CI 1. 2  to 4. 4) for low molecular <b>weight</b> <b>agents,</b> and 2. 1  (95 % CI 0. 9  to 5. 2) for mixed environments.  CONCLUSIONS—This asthma JEM, when enhanced by expert re-evaluation of exposure estimates from job title texts, may be a useful tool in general population studies of asthma. In this study, a 1. 7 -fold increase in prevalence odds of high risk exposures was found among asthmatic workers compared with controls, with risk magnitude varying for different classes of exposure.    Keywords: job exposure matrix; asthma; occupational exposure; epidemiological methods; case-contro...|$|R

Two tannin weighted samples TWS 1 and TWS 2 were obtained by using a first and a second charge procedure, respectively. The samples display identical ATR spectra and both similar to the un-weighted sample. The expected IR bands of the gallic acid [73] or the iron gallic complex [74] are probably masked by the fibroin bands. The Raman spectra of the samples are very similar and dominated by the iron (II)/gallic acid complex; this is also similar to the Raman spectrum of the iron gall inks. The most intense bands of the metal complex are located at 1473, 1318, 960, 813, 582 and 535  cm− 1, and the spectrum of the complex has the same spectral profile of that reported by Lee et al. [75].

Leaching tests and extractions that have been developed to evaluate heavy metal mobility in soils, ask for a careful interpretation when Ba is considered, and are probably not always suited for Ba because of unintended side effects such as precipitation reactions.

Designing the fluid requires {{a good understanding of}} sealing mechanisms and all the parameters affecting the sealing performance. Laboratory testing apparatus is the key concept for LCM evaluation ensuring successful treatment. The high-pressure test cell containing fracture discs is an effective tool among the broadly designed apparatus. A variety of formulations has been developed from the LCM physical properties. Recently, the testing conditions such as the slot wall angles and the fracture disc thickness were found to have significant effects on the evaluation results. However, the effect of the base fluids, fluid density, types of weighting materials and aging conditions has not been addressed. In this study, two different base fluids, water-based fluids and oil-based fluids, were used to compare the base-fluid effect. Drilling fluid density was raised up using barite and/or hematite to investigate the effect of the <b>weight</b> <b>agents.</b> Barite was sieved to study the effect of fine particles on the sealing. Finally, the dynamic aging tests were conducted in LCM-treated WBF using two temperature levels (200  °F and 400  °F) and two aging periods (24 and 72  h). The results showed that the base fluids affected the sealing performance depending on the complex interaction between the solid particles and the fluids. Adding <b>weighting</b> <b>agents</b> tended to improve the seal integrity. Adding proper size of fine particles improved the LCM sealing performance.

Methods: A total of 41, 724 mother-child pairs from The Danish National Birth Cohort were categorized according to maternal occupational exposure assessed by combining occupation during pregnancy and a job exposure matrix. AD in the offspring was defined by a combination of parentally reported AD and eczema in locations typical for AD.
