5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. As such, {{there was a significant}} drop in tourism, although no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists have mapped 268 {{structures}} {{clustered in}} 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core. Residential structures were {{concentrated in the}} area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on {{the north and west}} sides near to the reservoir. Residences tended to be larger the closer they <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reservoir. The residential area of El Chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors. Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, Panorama is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core. Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. Panorama was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.|$|E
5|$|By day four, the battalions of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were {{dispersed}} {{over a wide}} area. While the Borders <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west on a {{line from}} the River Rhine east of Heveadorp to the Heelsum road, the remaining KOSB companies lay to the north with the remnants of the Staffords forming part of Lonsdale Force in the east. Brigade headquarters was established on open ground at the centre of the divisional area. On day five (21 September), defence of the divisional area was divided between the two remaining brigade headquarters. The 1st Airlanding Brigade in the west now commanded the remaining three companies of Borders, the remnants of the KOSB, and what remained of the Royal Engineers, 21st Independent Company, Glider Pilots and Poles. Lonsdale Force Major Robert Henry Cain of the Staffords disabled a tank with a PIAT and then, although wounded by machine gun fire, positioned one of the division's artillery guns and destroyed it. This was the first of a number of actions by Major Cain which led to the award of a Victoria Cross. This second medal for the Staffords meant it became the only British battalion to receive two Victoria Crosses in one battle during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} say how he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by {{the shore of the}} lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, the Terrapins embarked upon {{a three-year}} run {{in which they}} lost only four games, and they defeated the Blue Jays each season including a shutout, 6–0, in 1930. In 1932, however, Hopkins defeated Maryland twice {{during the regular season}} and once more in a postseason game to decide participation in the Olympics. Between 1930 and 1934, the Blue Jays won three national championships and lost only two games, both of which <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Terrapins. Maryland captured national titles in 1936, 1937, and 1939. That year, however, Hopkins managed to break a four-game losing streak against them. The Terrapins won the 1940 title by beating the undefeated Blue Jays, 7–6, in the series' first game decided by one goal. Maryland finished the season with a perfect 10–0 record. The following year, Hopkins finished 12–0 and captured the national championship after a convincing victory over Maryland, 10–3. Johns Hopkins secured four more national titles from 1947 to 1950, and defeated Maryland each year, three times by a margin of at least six goals.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, England progressed strongly. Nightwatchman Alec Bedser hit three {{consecutive}} fours from Toshack, prompting Bradman {{to replace him}} with Johnson. Bedser surveyed Johnson's wares for one over before hitting him into the leg side {{three times in the}} next, yielding a six and two fours. Bradman responded by removing Johnson from the attack. When the off spinner came back, Edrich hit him for another six to reach 96. However, Johnson soon had his revenge. England reached 2/423 when Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. This ended a 155-run third-wicket partnership. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 4/426. Johnson's two wickets brought two new batsmen <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease and precipitated a collapse that saw England dismissed for 496. Johnson ended with 2/89 from 33 overs and was the least economical of the frontline bowlers except Toshack, who broke down with a knee injury.|$|E
