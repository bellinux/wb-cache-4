2500|$|In [...] "A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment" [...] Bradstreet {{writes a}} letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and <b>warm</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn." [...] She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E

50|$|Massive {{volcanic}} eruptions, {{specifically the}} flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), would release carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide and aerosols, which would cause either intense global <b>warming</b> (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> former) or cooling (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter).|$|R
25|$|Radiative forcing is {{a measure}} of the {{difference}} between the incoming radiation energy and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth.

However, if the global warming signal is significantly non-linear in time (i.e. not just a smooth linear increase), variations in the forced signal will leak into the AMO definition.
