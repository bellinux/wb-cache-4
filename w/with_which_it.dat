5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{commonly}} known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet top, is an edible species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has several characteristics <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A.mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of Hemlock, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with hemlock roots.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E

One such association was the South District Association; Slaughter served as clerk at that body's annual meeting in 1808 and 1809, and later served as its moderator for nine years. In 1813, he helped found the Kentucky Bible Society.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
