60|$|Yesterday Captain ----, Captain ----, and Captain ----, dined at Gad's.

I said I had been remarking at home, à propos of the London, that I knew of no shipwreck of a large strong ship (not carrying weight of guns) in the open sea, and that I could find none such in the shipwreck books. They all agreed that the unfortunate Captain Martin must have been unacquainted with the truth as to what can and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> done with a Steamship having rigging and canvas; and that no sailor would dream of turning a ship's stern to such a gale--unless his vessel could run faster than the sea. ---- said (and the other two confirmed) that the London was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale, and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsail--which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft, and can be set under the worst circumstances--the disaster could not have occurred. If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it, even of hammocks and the like. They said that under a Board of Enquiry into the wreck, any efficient witness must of necessity state this as the fact, and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was utterly bad; and as to the force of the wind, for which I suggested allowance, they all had been in West Indian hurricanes and in Typhoons, and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances.|$|E
60|$|There are, no doubt, in all countries, really {{contented}} characters, who {{not merely}} do not seek, {{but do not}} desire, what they do not already possess, and these naturally bear no ill-will towards such as have apparently a more favored lot. But the great mass of seeming contentment is real discontent, combined with indolence or self-indulgence, which, while taking no legitimate means of raising itself, delights in bringing others down to its own level. And if we look narrowly even at the cases of innocent contentment, we perceive that they only win our admiration when the indifference is solely to improvement in outward circumstances, {{and there is a}} striving for perpetual advancement in spiritual worth, or at least a disinterested zeal to benefit others. The contented man, or the contented family, who have no ambition to make any one else happier, to promote the good of their country or their neighborhood, or to improve themselves in moral excellence, excite in us neither admiration nor approval. We rightly ascribe this sort of contentment to mere unmanliness and want of spirit. The content which we approve is an ability to do cheerfully without <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> had, a just appreciation of the comparative value of different objects of desire, and a willing renunciation of the less when incompatible with the greater. These, however, are excellences more natural to the character, in proportion as it is actively engaged in the attempt to improve its own or some other lot. He who is continually measuring his energy against difficulties, learns what are the difficulties insuperable to him, and what are those which, though he might overcome, the success is not worth the cost. He whose thoughts and activities are all needed for, and habitually employed in, practicable and useful enterprises, is the person of all others least likely to let his mind dwell with brooding discontent upon things either not worth attaining, or which are not so to him. Thus the active, self-helping character is not only intrinsically the best, but is the likeliest to acquire all that is really excellent or desirable in the opposite type.|$|E

K. Ogden. It was Moore who suggested Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus for the title, an allusion to Baruch Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation. This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by David Pears and Brian McGuinness.|$|E

60|$|It {{may be said}} in objection, {{that the}} error in these cases was in the minor premise, not the major; an error of fact, not of principle; {{that it did not}} consist in supposing that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> inconceivable <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> true, but in supposing {{antipodes}} to be inconceivable, when present experience proves that they can be conceived. Even if this objection were allowed, and the proposition that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> inconceivable <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> true were suffered to remain unquestioned as a speculative truth, it would be a truth on which no practical consequence could ever be founded, since, on this showing, it is impossible to affirm of any proposition, not being a contradiction in terms, that it is inconceivable. Antipodes <b>were</b> really, <b>not</b> fictitiously, inconceivable to our ancestors: they are indeed conceivable to us; and as the limits of our power of conception have been so largely extended, by the extension of our experience and the more varied exercise of our imagination, so may posterity find many combinations perfectly conceivable to them which are inconceivable to us. But, as beings of limited experience, we must always and necessarily have limited conceptive powers; while it does not by any means follow that the same limitation obtains in the possibilities of Nature, nor even in her actual manifestations.|$|R
40|$|What is {{physical}} education and why does it exist? Despite its relatively long and storied history, consensus about {{physical education}}’s existence remains minimal.

I encourage other physical education professionals to determine and disseminate answers to the three questions and identify a physical education hedgehog concept in future publications...|$|R

40|$|The {{dedication}} of oncologists to their patients is undeniable. Patients given <b>what</b> <b>can</b> be a devastating diagnosis look to their physician for hope, guidance, and answers. The physician, in turn, must assimilate {{information from a}} staggering amount of resources and outlets and then form a plan that satisfies current practices and guidelines while still being consistent with the most current regulations set by a multitude of sources for oversight. Do all this for every patient in {{a time in which}} the number of new and continuing patients is ever increasing, and {{it is hardly surprising that}} the shocking overload can lead to physician burnout and, quite possibly, poorer patient care. Overload, be it information, task, knowledge, or expectation, is real, and to avoid succumbing, cancer care providers need to acknowledge that the problem exists by identifying the sources and admit that the problem of overload is out of control. Only then can providers begin to realize <b>what</b> <b>can</b> and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> done, so that they can focus attention on what they are doing when they are doing it—an application of mindfulness. To take control of the avalanche of incoming information, providers need to make good use of filters, set time aside to evaluate inbound intelligence, and identify and (importantly) rely on a narrow set of trusted resources. Although strategies on coping with overloads abound, the physician needs to be diligent in applying the available options to keep burnout at bay.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a lot of {{interest}} in the mathematics of the popular game Sudoku. In a typical Sudoku puzzle, a number of initial clues are given, and the solver uses strategies to fill in the remaining clues to complete the board. A well-known open problem is, “How many initial clues are necessary for the puzzle to have a unique completion?” In this talk, we shift the focus of study from clues to what we call packets. A packet gives information about <b>what</b> entries <b>can</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>be</b> in a cell. Introducing packets gives rise to some interesting questions about Sudoku and its $ 4 imes 4 $ counterpart, Shidoku. One such question is ``what is the minimum number of packets needed to describe a puzzle with a unique completion?'' This question parallels the minimum clue question. Packets are also intimately related to the Boolean system of polynomial equations used to describe the constraints of a Sudoku puzzle. They can be used to more efficiently calculate a Gr"obner basis of the ideal generated by this system of equations. Packets are also inherently related to human methods for solving Sudoku puzzles. To emulate human solving strategies we introduce the idea of solving symmetries [...] functions which manipulate a puzzle while maintaining the same solutions.
