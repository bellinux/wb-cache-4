5|$|Accompanying Azzimani to the Olympics, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> eight {{schoolchildren}} from Woippy, {{a suburb}} of the French city Metz. Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were from an area which saw rioting {{following the death of}} a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Laura Johnson and Harold Knight {{married in}} 1903 {{and made their}} {{first trip to the}} Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905. They visited the artists colony at Laren. The colony <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> {{followers}} of the Hague School of artists who had been painting in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Secondly, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> monastic cathedrals {{in which}} the bishop was titular abbot. These cathedrals are Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester, Winchester and Worcester. These monasteries were Benedictine except {{in the case of}} Carlisle, which was Augustinian. Six of these churches were built from the start as cathedrals. Carlisle and Ely are purely monastic churches, which then became the seat of a bishop during the course of construction. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, all the {{previously}} monastic cathedrals became governed by secular canons like the first group.|$|E
5|$|The Donner Party, or Donner-Reed Party, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> American pioneers led by George Donner and James F. Reed who {{set out for}} California in a {{wagon train}} in May 1846. They were delayed {{by a series of}} mishaps and mistakes, and spent the winter of 1846–47 snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Some of the pioneers resorted to {{cannibalism}} to survive.|$|E

5|$|The South Dakota class <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> four fast battleships {{built by}} the United States Navy.

5|$|Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was {{suspicious}} of him, and {{worried that he}} was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through {{the strength of its}} teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives within the military who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|The Amiral Charner class <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> four {{armoured}} cruisers {{built for}} the French Navy during the 1890s. They were designed to be smaller and cheaper than the preceding design while also serving as commerce raiders in times of war. Three of the ships {{were assigned to the}} International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With several exceptions the sister ships spent most of {{the first decade of the}} 20th century serving as training ships or in reserve. Bruix aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique in 1902. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906 and ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907. She proved impossible to refloat and was destroyed in place.|$|E

5|$|The Bayan class <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> four armored cruisers {{built for}} the Imperial Russian Navy around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. Two of the ships were built in France, as Russian shipyards had no spare capacity. The lead ship, , was built several years earlier than the later three. The ship participated in several of the early naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and provided naval gunfire support for the Imperial Russian Army until she struck a mine. Bayan was trapped in harbor during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur, and was sunk by Japanese artillery. She was salvaged and put into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy with the name of Aso. She mostly served as a training ship before she was converted into a minelayer in 1920. The ship was sunk as a target in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The C and D class <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> 14 destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. As in {{previous}} years, it was originally intended to order a complete flotilla comprising eight destroyers—plus a flotilla leader as the ninth unit—in each year. However, only four ships—plus a leader—were ordered under the 1929–30 Programme as the C class. The other four ships planned for the C class were never ordered as an economy measure and disarmament gesture by the Labour government of Ramsay Macdonald. A complete flotilla—the 'D' class—was ordered under the 1930–31 Programme.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli again {{took the}} lead in the disputation. His {{opponent}} was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing infant baptism with adult baptism. This group was led by Conrad Grebel, one of the initiators of the Anabaptist movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led {{to the question of whether}} the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from Aargau and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, Kurze, christliche Einleitung (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.|$|E
