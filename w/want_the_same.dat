25|$|The book characterizes al-Qaeda {{not as an}} {{offshoot}} of Islam but as a destructive religious cult. He suggests American federal officials create a position to coordinate actions against al-Qaeda, put together academic gatherings to discuss the matter, and use public relations to counter extremist ideology. Nance praises Barack Obama's oratory skills, and characterizes the president as a formidable public relations tool to use in achieving these objectives. The author emphasizes traditional Muslim people <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> goals and aspirations for their families as the desires of U.S. citizens.|$|E
25|$|This United States Supreme Court case {{occurred}} over the argument of tribal water rights, {{and whether or not}} the water rights are passed along with the tribal land. When American Indian reservations would sell allotments of land to non-tribe members, those to whom the land was sold would <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proportion of the reservation's water that the previous American Indian land owner had received. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier ruling that water rights are passed along with the land, meaning that a person who purchases land from an American Indian reservation also purchases an allotment of the water source used on the reservation.|$|E

However, Bianca is given a miracle when Miranda turns out alive. Maggie is elated, but Jonathan is {{disturbed}} by it all. When Bianca is at the brink of death after a fall from a deck due to a scuffle with JR, Jonathan, who {{is aware of the}} incident, does not tell Maggie. During a heated argument with him about it, after she discovers his deception, Jonathan loses his calm and slaps her. Maggie stays quiet about the physical altercation, and claims that the bruise on her face is due to a gym accident. The slap by Jonathan is only the beginning of his abuse of her.|$|E

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they <b>want,</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because it was like I was looking in the mirror and I didn't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E
500|$|The {{first stage}} is the Blind Auditions, where artists sing {{in front of}} the judges/coaches. In this round, each coach selects 14 singers for their team. Four coaches, all {{noteworthy}} recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each coach has the length of the auditioner's performance (about 90 seconds) to decide if they want the singer on their team. If one of the coaches is satisfied with the voice of an artist, and wants to mentor them for the next stage, they press the [...] "I WANT YOU" [...] button by their chair. This turns the chair around to face the stage, and allows the coach to see the artist for the first time after they have sung. This avoids any bias {{on the part of the}} judge/coach because of an artist's characteristics or personality. If two or more coaches <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> singer, the singer chooses their coach. The artist's journey on the show comes to an end if no coach selects them.|$|E
500|$|John Jude Palencar {{illustrated}} the English cover featuring the golden dragon Glaedr. The {{content of the}} cover {{was one of the}} few things initially confirmed by Paolini before he wrote the book. He had originally planned for it to feature a green dragon, but later indicated that this was affected by the expansion of the series to a four-book cycle. Paolini liked the cover because it reflects that Brisingr is the longest and [...] "most intense entry in the series so far." [...] The Japanese translation of Brisingr was so large that the publisher split it into two volumes. Since the Japanese did not <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cover on two volumes, they commissioned Palencar to paint one of the Lethrblaka for the second volume. The Lethrblaka are the Ra'zac's steeds and parents. Paolini made drawings based on the book for the deluxe edition of Brisingr, including one with Eragon's arm and hand holding the sword he receives in the book. The sword, named Brisingr, has flames around its blade.|$|E

On the way, Hurley is pulled over by deceased Oceanic Flight 815 survivor and former police officer Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who gives him {{advice on how to}} avoid the real cops. Upon arriving home, Hurley's dad, David, covers for them when the police show up and suggests that Hurley take Sayid to the hospital. Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story. Later, Ben unexpectedly shows up at the house and tries to convince Hurley to go with him to meet up {{with the rest of the}} Oceanic Six, saying they all <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing—to go back to the island. Hurley wavers for a moment, then runs outside and turns himself in to police watching the house, having been advised by Sayid to do the opposite of whatever Ben asks. Later, Ben visits Ms. Hawking, who tells him she has found the island and that Ben only has seventy hours to return to it with Locke's corpse and the Oceanic Six.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing to happen here." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bidding process}} is {{designed}} to create competition. [...] When multiple parties <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want {{the thing that is}} being bid on, they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents {{of the law}} {{maintain}} that a uniform, unambiguous set of laws that apply to all road users is easier for children to understand and allowing cyclists to behave by a separate set of rules than drivers makes them less predictable and thus, less safe.

Arthur Caplan, of New York University’s Division of Medical ethics, wrote that because Maynard was “young, vivacious, attractive … and a very different kind of person” from the average patient seeking physician-assisted dying—then averaging age 71 in Oregon—she “changed the optics of the debate” and got people in her generation interested in the issue. Marcia Angell, the former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that Maynard was a [...] "new face" [...] of the assisted dying movement who had [...] "greatly helped future patients who <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> choice."
