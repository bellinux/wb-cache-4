25|$|WAI-ARIA (<b>Web</b> <b>Accessibility</b> Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a {{technical}} specification {{which became a}} W3C Recommended Web Standard on 20 March 2014. It allows web pages (or portions of pages) to declare themselves as applications rather than as static documents, by adding role, property, and state information to dynamic web applications. ARIA is intended for use by developers of web applications, web browsers, assistive technologies, and accessibility evaluation tools.|$|E
25|$|The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s <b>Web</b> <b>Accessibility</b> Initiative (WAI) is {{an effort}} to improve the {{accessibility}} of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources.|$|E
25|$|In human–{{computer}} interaction, computer accessibility (also {{known as}} accessible computing) {{refers to the}} accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include <b>web</b> <b>accessibility</b> guidelines. Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Lasseo specifications, but with limited success {{due to the lack}} of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.|$|E
50|$|The W3C {{discourage}} {{the use of}} meta refresh, since it does not communicate any information about either the original or new resource, to the browser (or search engine). The W3C's <b>Web</b> Content <b>Accessibility</b> Guidelines (7.4) {{discourage the}} creation of auto-refreshing pages, since most web browsers do not allow the user to disable or control the refresh rate. Some articles that they have written on the issue include W3C <b>Web</b> Content <b>Accessibility</b> Guidelines (1.0): Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes, Use standard redirects: don't break the back button! and Core Techniques for <b>Web</b> Content <b>Accessibility</b> Guidelines 1.0 section 7.|$|R
