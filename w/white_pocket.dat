60|$|Soon {{after the}} capture of the City of Mexico an {{armistice}} had been agreed to, designating the limits beyond which troops of the respective armies were not to go during its continuance. Our party knew nothing about these limits. As we approached Cuantla bugles sounded the assembly, and soldiers rushed from the guard-house in {{the edge of the}} town towards us. Our party halted, and I tied a <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> handkerchief to a stick and, using it as a flag of truce, proceeded on to the town. Captains Sibley and Porter followed a few hundred yards behind. I was detained at the guard-house until a messenger could be dispatched to the quarters of the commanding general, who authorized that I should be conducted to him. I had been with the general but a few minutes when the two officers following announced themselves. The Mexican general reminded us that it was a violation of the truce for us to be there. However, as we had no special authority from our own commanding general, and as we knew nothing about the terms of the truce, we were permitted to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for the night, with the promise of a guide to put us on the road to Cuernavaca the next morning.|$|E

5000|$|The basidiocarps (fruiting body), conks, are {{the most}} {{apparent}} signs on infected trees. The conks are perennial, usually gregarious, imbricate, and shelve-shaped, about 3 inches wide. The tops of conks are reddish brown to blackish with concentric furrows; the underside is yellow-brown, while for growing conks, the undersurface and margin of growing conks is a bright yellowish-brown with large irregular pores. [...] <b>White</b> <b>pockets</b> usually develop where the conks develop, but the decay may extend 4 ft above and 5 ft below a conk. Decay tends to occur {{at the base of}} stem, but may also develop into large roots. In the early stage of decay, the affected wood becomes reddish to purplish in color. A cross section of the affected wood shows a well-defined ring. In advanced stages of decay, small, spindle-shaped <b>white</b> <b>pockets</b> are formed due to the degradation of lignin by P. pini. The <b>white</b> <b>pockets</b> are mostly hollow and delignified and contain white residual cellulose.|$|R

50|$|Hericium abietis {{causes a}} <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> rot of conifers; {{this is a}} form of wood decay {{featuring}} a selective attack on lignin and hemicellulose in wood. The fruit bodies grow singly or occasionally in small groups on the dead wood of conifers, especially fir and Douglas fir. It can also be cultivated on conifer sawdust. The species is found throughout North America.|$|E
5000|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is common in}} North America. The {{pathogen}} Phellinus pini is widely spread in the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere. [...] It infects {{a wide range of}} coniferous trees, including jack pine, lodgepole pine, Sitka and white spruce, Douglas-fir, balsam and true fir, western hemlock, and tamarack. It attacks both heartwood and sapwood and causes <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> trunk rot.|$|E
50|$|Identification in {{affected}} wood, {{known as}} <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> rot, includes symptoms {{in the form}} of dark discolouration around the heartwood near the base. Heavily diseased wood will be soft, stringy, and fibrous that may contain black specks parallel to the grain. Quick identification of affected wood can be done by wrapping suspect wood in damp paper towels and left for 5-6 days for the tell-tale formation of the conidial anamorph, Spiniger meineckellus. The basidiospores are spherical to ellipsoid, distinctive of the family Bondarzewiaceae.|$|E
50|$|P. pini is {{the most}} common {{pathogen}} to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and causes the largest decay columns. There is red staining in the early stages and tends to develop along the annual rings. The decay can be identified with <b>white</b> <b>pockets</b> and punk knots (a slight swollen, resinous knot) and conks. Decay usually occurs mostly in the basal stem and may extend to roots.|$|R
30|$|To {{study the}} effect of Denimax core- 1380 on back-staining the K/S values of <b>white</b> cotton <b>pocket</b> {{material}} attached to both the denim fabrics was assessed with or without treatment of 1 % of the stain regulating agent. In case of indigo dyed denim samples, no substantial difference was observed in the K/S values of <b>white</b> cotton <b>pocket</b> material, {{with or without the}} treatment. The fading effect of sulphur dyed denim samples with two different enzymes before and after Denimax core 1380 S treatment are shown in Fig.  5 c and also for <b>white</b> cotton <b>pocket</b> lining fabric in Fig.  5 d. The possible explanation for back staining in sulphur colour is as follows.|$|R
5000|$|The mottled <b>white</b> <b>pockets</b> and {{bleaching}} effect seen in spalted wood is due {{to white}} rot fungi. Primarily found on hardwoods, these fungi 'bleach' by consuming lignin, which is the slightly pigmented area of a wood cell wall. Some white rotting can also be caused by an effect similar to pigmentation, in which the white hyphae of a fungus, such as Trametes versicolor (Fr.) Pil., is so concentrated {{in an area that}} a visual effect is created.|$|R
50|$|Most commercially {{important}} conifers in Canada, including white spruce, are {{attacked by}} Inonotus tomentosus (Fr.) Teng {{also known as}} Onnia tomentosa (Whitney 1978). This fungus produces a <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> rot commonly called Tomentosus root rot in both roots and butts of naturally seeded or planted conifers. White spruce and black spruce {{were found to be}} the 2 most susceptible species in an inoculation test in Saskatchewan (Whitney 1964), and high losses to root rot, in large part due to I. tomentosus, affected white spruce plantations at Grand-Mère QC (Lachance 1978). In white spruce plantations, mortality in groups of 2 or 3 trees usually occurs at about age 30-35 years (Whitney 1977), but younger trees can also be killed (Whitney 1993). Occasional trees as young as 10 years of age are infected (Whitney and Timmer 1983). Seventeen white spruce plantations 43-58 years old in Ontario incurred an average of 0.7% mortality annually over a 6-year study period (Whitney 1993). Average accumulated mortality of dominant and codominant trees was 10.3% for all plantations in that study. Tomentosus root rot was found in more than half the stumps after clearcutting in a plantation at Searchmont, Ontario, but decay and stain had not yet reached stump height (Whitney 1962).|$|E
40|$|International audienceEvidence of fungal decay is {{frequently}} encountered in silicified wood. However, studies focusing on fossil fungal wood degradation remain rare. A characteristic pattern of degradation and decay symptoms congruent with present-day <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> rot occur in Late Permian silicified glossopteridalean stem and root wood (Australoxylon sp.) from Skaar Ridge, Antarctica. Co-occurring with the decay symptoms are fungal hyphae with clamp connections. Hyphae usually {{progress through the}} pit apertures, but some may also penetrate tracheid walls. The individual wall layers {{in some of the}} infected tracheids are separated from each other, apparently forming appositions. Small, opaque bodies (?arthropod coprolites) occur in some of the decay pockets. The abundance of infected specimens among the silicified woods from Skaar Ridge suggests that <b>white</b> <b>pocket</b> rot fungi were important decomposers in late Paleozoic high-latitude forest ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Hydrobasaluminite, like alunite and natroalunite, {{has formed}} as a {{by-product}} of the H 2 S-H 2 SO 4 speleo-genesis of Cottonwood Cave located in the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico. This mineral is found as the major component of <b>white</b> <b>pockets</b> in the dolostone bedrock where clay-rich seams containing kaolinite, dickite, and illite have altered during speleogenesis to hydrobasaluminite, amorphous silica, alunite, and hydrated halloysite (endellite). Gibbsite and amorphous silica {{are associated with the}} hydrobasaluminite in a small room of Cottonwood Cave. Opalline sediment on the floor of this room accumulated as the cave passage evolved. Jarosite, in trace amounts, occurs in association with the opalline sediment and most likely has the same origin as hydrobasaluminite and alunite. The hydrobasa-luminite was found to be unstable at 25 ºC and 50 % RH, converting to basaluminite in a few hours. Basaluminite was not detected in the cave samples. Aluminite has precipitated as a secondary mineral in the same small room where hydrobasaluminite occurs. It comprises a white to bluish-white, pasty to powdery moonmilk coating on the cave walls. The bedrock pockets containing hydrobasaluminite provide the ingredients from which aluminite moonmilk has formed. It appears that recent cave waters have removed alumina and sulfate from the bedrock pock-et minerals and have deposited aluminite and gypsum along the cave wall. Gypsum, amorphous silic...|$|R
