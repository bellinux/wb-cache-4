5|$|The {{water was}} turned off at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again {{during the winter of}} 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{city and}} state then had to provide a location, {{and one of the}} {{promises}} the city made was to erect a fitting memorial to those who served in World War I. Thus, in January 1920 a public library, St. Clair Park, University Park, and two occupied city blocks were designated as the site for the plaza, with one new building for the American Legion to use as their national headquarters, various public buildings, and a war memorial. The Indiana War Memorial Bill was passed in July 1920 and appropriated $2 million for construction and land. Work began in 1921. The {{city and state}} reached an agreement whereby the city <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the site and maintenance costs, while the State of Indiana <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the memorial's construction. The Plaza was dedicated by the Legion in November 1921 with the laying of a cornerstone from the bridge over the River Marne at Château-Thierry.|$|E
5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a decade before the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E

5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock. Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now bound up in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new ballpark, but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer. At one point, a new stadium, First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built. A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Congress disbanded in {{the third}} week of December, and the next step would be a {{congress}} at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand's rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich's policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont <b>would</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had {{come at the expense of}} the Anglo-Austrian entente.|$|E
