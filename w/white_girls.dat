5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five <b>white</b> <b>girls,</b> aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted his emphasis on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little <b>White</b> <b>Girls,</b> but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E

25|$|White's {{first major}} {{struggle}} {{as leader of}} the NAACP centered on the Scottsboro Trial in 1931. It was also a case that tested the competition between the NAACP and the American Communist Party to represent the black community. The NAACP and Walter White wanted to increase their following in the black community. Weeks after White started in his new position at the NAACP, nine black teenagers looking for work were arrested after a fight with a group of white teens as the train both groups were riding on passed through Scottsboro, Alabama. Two <b>white</b> <b>girls</b> accused the nine black teenagers of rape.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of <b>white</b> <b>girls</b> trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E
500|$|Whistler {{started on}} Symphony in White, No. 3 perhaps {{as early as}} July 1865. It {{was the last of}} his {{paintings}} for which Heffernan was a model. He used Milly Jones, the wife of an actor friend, as the second model for the painting. By the middle of August, he had a complete sketch ready, and he continued work on the painting into September. Whistler kept reworking it, however, and it was not until 1867 that he considered it finished. He painted over the final [...] "5" [...] in the date, and replaced it with a [...] "7", to mark the changes it had undergone. In March 1867, William Michael Rossetti wrote of seeing the painting in Whistler's studio, and mentioned that it was previously called The Two Little <b>White</b> <b>Girls.</b> It then went on display at the Royal Academy.|$|E

500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, <b>white</b> <b>girls,</b> [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
2500|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{an earlier age}} of the onset of puberty. [...] However, they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969.

[...] The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48% of African-American girls by age nine, and 12% of <b>white</b> <b>girls</b> by that age.|$|E

Jackson declined Alabama and Georgia because he was fearful of the South at the time, and declined Oklahoma because they told him to stop dating <b>white</b> <b>girls.</b> For baseball, Jackson was scouted by Hans Lobert of the San Francisco Giants who was desperate to sign him.
