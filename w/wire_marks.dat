40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} the diagnostic reliability of selective microdochectomy after direct ductoscopic <b>wire</b> <b>marking</b> of suspect lesions {{in patients with}} pathological nipple discharge. Methods Selective microdochectomy due to pathological discharge was performed in 33 patients with mean age of 51. 7 years. Ductoscopes of 0. 9 and 1. 1 mm in diameter with a channel for <b>wire</b> <b>marking</b> were used. Only patients without sonographic or mammographic correlation for the discharge were included. The pathologic mammary duct was <b>wire</b> <b>marked</b> and extirpated under direct visual guidance via the ductoscope. The histological results were compared with cytology, galactography and ductoscopy. Results In 24 out of 33 cases (72 %) an intraductal, epithelial proliferation was found histologically. The following sensitivities for intraductal, epithelial proliferations could be determined: cytology 4 %, galactography 74 %, and ductoscopy 78 %. Conclusion The method allows selective microdochectomy of the pathological duct and the intraductal proliferation under visual guidance.

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{based on}} the Chapman Printing Smoothness Tester has been devised to measure the distribution of paper surface roughness variations in the wavelength region between 1 / 6 and 1 / 90 of an inch. The measurement is made by scanning a small spot of light over the contact interface between a smooth glass block and the paper surface. Light scattered from the interface at a shallow angle {{is proportional to the}} area of optical contact lying within the spot, and is detected by a sensitive photomultiplier tube. A frequency analysis of this time-varying photomultiplier signal yields a band-limited noise spectrum corresponding to the random distribution of optical contact areas, along with distinct peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the regular patterns of the woven wire screen upon which the paper was initially formed, (the <b>wire</b> <b>mark).</b> A quantitative assessment of the <b>wire</b> <b>mark</b> intensity may be made by taking the ratio of the average component of the photomultiplier tube signal at the frequency of the <b>wire</b> <b>mark</b> pattern to the total average value of the signal...|$|R

40|$|This thesis treats {{static and}} dynamic surface {{characterization}} using radiometric and Fourier optical methods. A Fourier optical method {{has been developed}} for real time image processing in paper production and printing applications. It {{has been shown that}} the method can be used to measure crepe frequency, an important parameter in tissue paper production, as well as to monitor the <b>wire</b> <b>mark</b> pattern at paper web velocities of up to 20 m/s. The <b>wire</b> <b>mark</b> pattern has been used to measure dimensional variations across a paper web. These are important for the mechanical properties of paper. Imaging of the moving surfaces onto a spatial light modulator, necessary for Fourier optical analysis of opaque objects, constitutes a motion blur problem. This problem has been solved by means of optical motion compensation using a rotating mirror. A rotating mirror system has also been developed for the inspection of small particles fixed to a rotating sample disc. The optical motion compensation configurations have made exposure times of more than two orders of magnitude longer than the exposure time without compensation possible. A light scattering model for opaque objects, for example coated paper, has also been developed and verified, with a coefficient of determination between theory and measurement ranging from r 2 = 0. 84 to r 2 = 0. 98, on various paper samples. The light scattering model has been used in the development of an instrument based on the photometric stereo principle. In this instrument the reflectance (or color) and topography of opaque samples are determined from two or more images of the sample illuminated from different directions. The method has been successfully used for studies of the relation between topography and print results in gravure and flexographic printing. Comparisons of surface height profiles measured with the photometric stereo method and profiles obtained with mechanical and optical scanning stylus instruments have shown coefficients of determination of up to r 2 = 0. 97. The main advantages of the method are the high speed, the scalability and the ability to obtain reflectance and surface height maps of a surface simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|Background: Collision with {{electric}} power lines is a conservation problem for many bird species. Although {{the implementation of}} flight diverters is rapidly increasing, few well-designed studies supporting {{the effectiveness of this}} costly conservation measure have been published. Methodology/Principal Findings: We provide information on the largest worldwide marking experiment to date, including carcass searches at 35 (15 experimental, 20 control) power lines totalling 72. 5 km, at both transmission (220 kV) and distribution (15 kV– 45 kV) lines. We found carcasses of 45 species, 19 of conservation concern. Numbers of carcasses found were corrected to account for carcass losses due to removal by scavengers or being overlooked by researchers, resulting in an estimated collision rate of 8. 2 collisions per km per month. We observed a small (9. 6 %) but significant {{decrease in the number of}} casualties after line marking compared to before line marking in experimental lines. This was not observed in control lines. We found no influence of either marker size (large vs. small spirals, sample of distribution lines only) or power line type (transmission vs. distribution, sample of large spirals only) on the collision rate when we analyzed all species together. However, great bustard mortality was slightly lower when lines were marked with large spirals and in transmission lines after marking.
