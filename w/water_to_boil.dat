5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
25|$|A BWR {{is like a}} PWR {{without the}} steam generator. A boiling water reactor is cooled and moderated by water like a PWR, but at a lower {{pressure}}, which allows the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> inside the pressure vessel producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, {{and they can be}} simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor and the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.|$|E
25|$|BWRs are {{characterized}} by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses 235U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil,</b> generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity. During normal operation, pressure {{is controlled by the}} amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.|$|E

Encysted protozoan pathogens may require higher temperatures to remove any risk.|$|R
25|$|By 19 June, Herefordshire was {{affected}} by flooding. The M50 motorway near Ledbury was closed on 22 July due to flooding. More than 5,200 people in and around Bromyard, Herefordshire were without clean water on 22 and 23 July after the pumps at the Whitbourne works in Herefordshire failed. Once supply was restored residents were urged by Welsh <b>Water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> their tap-water until further notice. The village of Hampton Bishop, 3miles (5km) {{from the city of}} Hereford remains surrounded and flooded by water after the River Lugg burst its banks. On the afternoon of 24 July the Fire Service began pumping flood water out of the village, but not before 130 residents were evacuated. Houses, including the Herefordshire home of Daily Mail writer Quentin Letts, were flooded by a torrent of water gushing from what had previously been only a small, unnamed brook north of Ross-on-Wye.|$|E
25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{these terms}} are rarely {{used in the}} peer-reviewed climatological {{literature}}, that literature does use the similar phrase [...] "runaway greenhouse effect", which refers specifically to climate changes that cause a planetary body's <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> off.|$|E

In 2013, further developments in habitable zone theory were made with the proposal of a circumplanetary habitable zone, {{also known as the}} [...] "habitable edge", to encompass the region around a planet where the orbits of natural satellites would not be disrupted, {{and at the same time}} tidal heating from the planet would not cause liquid <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil</b> away.|$|E
2500|$|A samovar (...) is a {{traditional}} Kashmiri kettle used to brew, boil and serve Kashmiri salted tea (Noon Chai) and kahwa. Kashmiri samovars are made of copper with engraved or embossed calligraphic motifs. In fact in Kashmir, there were two variants of Samovar. The copper Samovar was used by Muslims and that of Brass was used by local Hindus called Kashmiri Pandit. The brass Samovars were nickel-plated inside. Inside a samovar there is a fire-container in which charcoal and live coals are placed. Around the fire-container there is a space for <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil.</b> Tea leaves, sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon are put into the water.|$|E

40|$|Haiti is {{the poorest}} {{country in the}} Western {{hemisphere}} and {{is in need of}} cheap cooking fuel source. Currently, lump charcoal, the cooking fuel of Haiti, is made by carbonizing trees in ditches before selling the charcoal at market. However, Haiti is now 98 % deforested and {{must find a way to}} prepare their food that does not destroy their land. The idea for this new fuel comes from compressed and extruded carbonized bagasse, which was produced using an extruder developed in a senior product development class at MIT. Using this bagasse fuel, experiments were conducted to compare the combustion characteristics of the bagasse charcoals with wood charcoal. Unfortunately, the heat released by the bagasse charcoal did not compare favorably with that of the wood charcoal, failing to raise 1 L of <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> while the wood charcoal raised the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> for 25 minutes. Since the bagasse charcoal performed similarly to Kingsford brand charcoal, the emissions released were compared between these two fuels. Based on their averages, the bagasse charcoal emitted 1. 4 times more CO, 1. 6 times more SO₂ and 2. 3 times more particulates but only 17 % of the NOx emitted by Kingsford. by Andrés Ramírez.

All the windows were broken, and the lighter articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage was done.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is <b>to</b> bring <b>water</b> <b>to</b> a <b>boil</b> and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is <b>to</b> bring the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> a <b>boil,</b> but then remove the pan {{from the heat and}} allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|R

60|$|We went on deck. Would we eat on board, asked another person. No, we wouldn't.

In a sheltered place I lit the spirit lamp, and put on <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil.</b> The water we had taken from the cabin. Then we sat down alone in the darkness, on a seat which had its back against the deck cabins, now appropriated by the staff. A thin, cold wind was travelling.

60|$|My work, it is true, {{was over}} {{early in the}} morning. I rose before any one else, lit the stove, put on the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil,</b> and strolled forth upon the {{platform}} to wait till it was ready. Silverado would then be still in shadow, the sun shining on the mountain higher up. A clean smell of trees, a smell of the earth at morning, hung in the air. Regularly, every day, there was a single bird, not singing, but awkwardly chirruping among the green madronas, and the sound was cheerful, natural, and stirring. It did not hold the attention, nor interrupt the thread of meditation, like a blackbird or a nightingale; it was mere woodland prattle, of which the mind was conscious like a perfume. The freshness of these morning seasons remained with me far on into the day.|$|E
6000|$|That eating large {{quantities}} of snow should seriously disturb the animal system is credible enough, {{when we consider the}} very large amount of heat that must be abstracted from the stomach, in order to melt it. A mouthful of snow at 32 degrees Fahr., that is to say, no colder than is necessary for it to be snow at all, robs as much heat from the stomach, as if the mouthful had been of water 143 degrees colder than ice-cold water, if such a fluid may, for the moment, be imagined to exist. For the [...] "latent heat" [...] of water is 143 degrees Fahr. In other words, it takes the same quantity of heat to convert a mass of snow of 32 degrees into water of 32º, as it does to raise the same mass of water from 32 degrees to 141º + 32 degrees = 175 degrees Fahr. It takes in practice about as long to melt snow of a low temperature into water, as it does to cause that same <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>boil.</b> Thus to raise snow of 5 degrees below zero Fahr. To 32 degrees, takes 37 degrees of heat, and it requires 143 degrees more, or 180 degrees altogether, to melt it into water. Also it requires 180 degrees to convert water of 32 degrees into water of 212 degrees, in other words, into boiling water.|$|E
