2500|$|Condoleezza Rice—the top ranking African-American in the Bush cabinet—responded to {{the speech}} on March 28, saying, [...] "I {{think it was}} {{important}} that he (Obama) gave it for a whole host of reasons." [...] Rice {{went on to say that}} [...] "here is a paradox for this country and a contradiction of this country and we still haven't resolved it... but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> understood as a black American is that black Americans loved and had faith in this country even when this country didn't love and have faith in them, and that's our legacy." [...] Colin Powell—Rice's predecessor as Secretary of State—described Obama's speech as [...] "a very, very thoughtful, direct speech", and added: [...] "I admired him for giving it, and I agreed with much of what he said." ...|$|E

I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, and I understand that violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it.

People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I {{got to know the}} women who would come to my husband for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April {{and if we can}} try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, but that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to try to shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{spate of}} studies seeking to {{elaborate}} {{a theology of}} religions that have appeared {{over the last five}} years, it is evident that the question of the "many religions," like that of the "many poor," is {{one of the issues that}} most disturb, and therefore can most invigorate, Christian consciousness. In <b>what</b> follows, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to review and analyze <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think are some of the pivotal issues in Christian efforts to come to a clearer, more adequate and coherent, understanding of other religions and of Christianity in the light of other faiths...|$|R

2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E

Earlier, in February 2000, he said that women would never excel in Formula One, stating [...] "she {{would have to be a}} woman who was blowing away the boys. ... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> really <b>like</b> to see happen is to find the right girl, perhaps a black girl with super looks, preferably Jewish or Muslim, who speaks Spanish." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of genre or pen name, Meaker's {{books have}} in common complex {{characters}} that have difficult relationships and complicated problems, who rail against conformity. Meaker said of this approach, [...] "I was a bookworm and a poetry lover. When I think of myself and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> to have found in books those many years ago, I remember being depressed by all the neatly tied-up, happy-ending stories, the abundance of winners, the themes of winning, solving, finding — when around me it didn't seem that easy.

Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time I've really been involved [...] Whereas before, I'd just sort of pick out other people's songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> to say, on this, we're really trying to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, thank you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the large pavilion and lobby is circular and constructed of glass and metal supports to contrast with the solid geometric lines of the actual hall. Architect I. M. Pei, and structural engineer Leslie E. Robertson Associates has described {{the structure of the}} hall's interior as [...] "very conservative". [...] "It is conservative for reasons I no longer accept," [...] he said in 2000. [...] "I feel that the hall doesn't fully represent <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> to do. It was my first one." [...] Because the music performed in the hall was likely to be from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pei was unwilling to impose modern styles of architecture on the interior.|$|R

40|$|In <b>what</b> follows <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to try to}} {{draw your}} {{attention}} to certain passages from Plato and Xenophon which are indicative, I believe, of the Socratic way of philosophising {{as it relates to}} his novel conception of justice as virtue and harmony both in the well-ordered souls of ideal citizens. It will become clear, I hope, that Socrates' paradoxical politics of the human soul in search for true happiness through a virtuous life, and his conception of justice as an internal personal affair, contrasts sharply with the external and social theory of justice in its long history from Glaucon and Thrasymachus in antiquity, to Locke and Rousseau in modern times, to John Rawls in our times.

First, the existing documentation, especially the two Starting Strong reports, can and should be used to deepen critical reflection on policy, provision and practice. Properly used, the documentation should be a constant provocation, helping to make the familiar strange and so challenging taken-for-granted assumptions. Why do we do that? Why have we never done that? What are the effects of doing ECEC in one way or another? Starting Strong can be used at all levels for this purpose: on a college course or in a local early childhood service, within a local community, or by a regional or national government or organisation.|$|R
40|$|I {{stand before}} you as <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> reluctantly <b>like</b> {{to call a}} crisis conservationist. In marine {{fisheries}} conservation we {{are exposed to the}} full blast of human greed. Dr Hey has referred to the unfortunate human attitudes to nature conservation. I fully share his concern. Fisheries conservation finds itself in the unenviable position of having largely to apply conservation principles to species which are more often than not in advanced stages of commercial exploitation. In this situation ethics, aesthetics and science cuts little or no ice with decision-makers. The only language which they understand is economics. Unfortunately fisheries conservation has also been hampered by the well-meant but thoroughly unscientific efforts of certain lay so-called "conservation societies". Through their admirable but purely humanistic approach to conservation, they have antagonized economically-orientated decision-makers and thereby unfortunately harmed the cause of conservation.  </p...|$|R
500|$|In late 2013, a {{team led}} by the Irish {{physicist}} Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, [...] "In <b>what</b> follows, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [...] facts, and in which the density is constant over time" ...

For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space." ...|$|R
