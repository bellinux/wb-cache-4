25|$|The {{advent of}} <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{required}} further airport {{development in the}} 1970s, which had already been foreseen by the Ruler of Dubai, and {{plans for a new}} Terminal, runways, and taxiways capable of coping with international flights were drawn up.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the airport}} is able to handle eleven <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft</b> at one time, with {{additional}} five parking places for general aviation aircraft. It cannot accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380 or the Boeing 747-8. This airport {{does not have any}} air bridges installed, so buses take the passengers from the airport terminal to the aircraft where air stairs are used.|$|E
25|$|From 1968 to 1971, {{the airport}} {{underwent}} expansion and modernization. It was reopened on September 25, 1971 with an asphalt runway (2500m45m), larger apron (450m70m), extended taxiways, and completely new passenger terminal and control tower. After the 1979 earthquake, the airport {{was once again}} refurbished. Notably, the apron was expanded (460m91.5m) and taxiways widened, so the airport could handle <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Jat Tehnika {{date back to}} the {{creation}} of Aeroput in 1927.The first technicians and mechanics started working as pioneers of this profession in 1927. Jat Airways was founded in 1947 as the successor of Aeroput. In 1963 a jet engine fleet was introduced. The first <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> DC-10 <b>aircraft</b> arrived in 1978, followed by the new technology aircraft 737-300 in 1984.|$|R
25|$|In September 2014 typical {{commercial}} {{passenger traffic}} included Airbus A319/A320s, Boeing 737s, Embraer 170s, MD-80s, Boeing 717s, CRJ 900s, CRJ700s, CRJ 200s, and Embraer 145s models on about 128 take offs or landings daily. The dominant mainline aircraft was the Boeing 737 due to Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines service. Delta also uses the Airbus A319/A320 and MD-88 on its mainline flights. American Eagle (Republic Airlines) and Delta Connection (Compass Airlines) uses the Embraer 170. The CRJ700/900 family {{was the most}} common regional aircraft, being used by American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express. The Canadair Regional Jets and ERJ 145 shared the second spot for regional jets, being utilized by the airlines above as well as American Eagle. Southern Airways Express operates on demand charter flights to select cities on the Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft (the only scheduled passenger service to BHM on turbo-prop aircraft). Mountain Air Cargo also operates daily flights to Memphis using the ATR-72 twin-turboprop aircraft on behalf of FedEx Express. Unique regularly scheduled aircraft included a Boeing 727-200 and Boeing 757-200 operated by FedEx as well as the Airbus A300-600 and Boeing 767-300F (seasonal) operated by UPS, the only <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft</b> to routinely use the airport. Numerous other aircraft are used for frequent charter flights. Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport is also a primary diversion airport for both Memphis International Airport and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport due to its 12,007ft runway, which frequently brings brief but unique visitors.|$|E
25|$|Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) was {{operating}} {{all of its}} SFO flights by 1962 with new Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets with nonstop service to Los Angeles (LAX) and Burbank (BUR, now Bob Hope Airport) with direct one stop flights to San Diego (SAN) via LAX or BUR. PSA {{was operating}} 14 departures a day on a Monday through Thursday basis to southern California {{in the summer of}} 1962 with 21 departures on Fridays and 22 departures on Sundays. By 1965, PSA was operating new Boeing 727-100 jetliners on its intrastate routes in California, which were joined in 1967 by new Boeing 727-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets. In 1974, PSA was operating new wide-body Lockheed L-1011 TriStar jetliners on flights from SFO nonstop to Los Angeles and Sacramento with direct one stop service to San Diego and was the only intrastate airline in the U.S. ever to operate <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Following the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, PSA then expanded its route system outside of California. By 1967, another intrastate air carrier had joined PSA at SFO: Air California operating Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets nonstop to Orange County Airport (SNA, now John Wayne Airport). Like PSA, Air California (later renamed AirCal) eventually became an all-jet airline and expanded its route network outside of California. AirCal was acquired by and merged into American Airlines while PSA was acquired by and merged into USAir (later renamed US Airways and then eventually merged with American Airlines).|$|E

40|$|According to the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) project, {{the most}} {{important}} European airports should implement the A-CDM (Airport Collaborative Decision Making). In this work, I realized a preliminary analysis of the A-CDM implementation in the Barcelona - El Prat airport, using real traffic/operative data kindly offered by Aena (Week 14, 2015). To obtain a quantitative parameterization for this project, I performed an analysis based on the actual capacity of the airport, which {{is a function of}} the structure of the airside area, the number of aircrafts operating in the airport and their characteristics. The architecture of the active runways defines a result of 90 operations per hour. Moreover, based on the CDM analysis, I created useful parameters the values and characteristics of which can be used for the A-CDM to understand, quantify and evaluate and the implementation and the benefits of the new system. I quantified the benefits with a double comparative analysis: (i) an analysis based on the global traffic of the airport and (ii) based on timely flights with similar characteristics. Among the several useful results, I underline the improvement of aspects of the EXOT (Estimated Taxi Out Time) assigned to <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircrafts,</b> which are the most penalized in the new system. Finally, I estimated the emissions of the traffic and the environmental impact of the A-CDM implementation with a comparative analysis of the week 24 (2014 against 2015), adjusting for the delay due to the airport CDM restrictions. Such estimation indicates the possibility of significant savings of greenhouse gases emissions...|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{preliminary design}} trades conducted under NASA contracts NAS 1 18889 (Advanced Technology Composite Aircraft Structures, ATCAS) and NAS 1 - 19349 (Task 3, Pathfinder Shell Design) for a subsonic <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> commercial <b>aircraft</b> fuselage side panel section utilizing composite materials. Included {{in this effort}} were (1) development of two complete design concepts, (2) generation of cost and weight estimates, (3) identification of technical issues and potential design enhancements, and (4) selection of a single design to be further developed. The first design concept featured an open-section stringer stiffened skin configuration while the second was based on honeycomb core sandwich construction. The trade study cost and weight results were generated from comprehensive assessment of each structural component comprising the fuselage side panel section from detail fabrication through airplane final assembly. Results were obtained in three phases: (1) for the baseline designs, (2) after global optimization of the designs, and (3) the results anticipated after detailed design optimization. A critical assessment of both designs was performed to determine the risk associated with each concept, that is the relative probability of achieving the cost and weight projections. Seven critical technical issues were identified {{as the first step}} towards side panel detailed design optimization...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{increasing}} {{manufacturing cost}} effectiveness becomes a vital {{condition for the}} commercial success {{of the next generation}} of large <b>wide</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> Welding is a very strong candidate process to be used in manufacturing, allowing both sensible cost reductions and structural efficiency. The main aim of the work is to study the fatigue crack propagation in welded structures. The study is focused on the effect of welding residual stresses to the damage tolerance behaviour of the structure. The welding technique under investigation is the Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA). Two stringer panels were designed, one tension panel to simulate the lower wing skin cover and one compression panel to mimic the upper wing skin cover. The main design driving force for the upper stiffened panel is buckling since it is under compression. Damage tolerance is the main design criterion for the lower stiffened panel due tensile fatigue loading. Design of the end- fittings for the tension stiffened panel was also carried out using finite element modelling in order to ensure uniform stress distribution at the cross section of the test area of the structure. A fatigue analysis at the various locations of the bolts and at the weld line has been performed. This is necessary {{in order to ensure that}} the crack initiation site comes from the weld line rather than from the fastener holes at the end-fittings during the fatigue testing. The research was focused on fatigue crack growth behaviour of welded aluminium panels. The FE model of the CCT coupon is the main tool for the comparison of the fatigue crack behaviour between the parent and the welded coupons. Furthermore AFGROW software is used in conjuction with the output of the FE model to compare the experimental and numerical results in terms of fatigue crack growth lives of welded coupons. In welded coupons a faster crack propagation growth was demonstrated at the region of the weld line and the heat affected zone (HAZ) due to the tensile welding residual stresses. Away from this region, a decrease in crack growth took place due to the compressive welding residual stresses in this area. Finally, a calculation effort in large-scale stiffened panels was made in terms of the stress intensity factor for both welded and non-welded cases. Possible future work was also addressed in such large-scale structures. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
