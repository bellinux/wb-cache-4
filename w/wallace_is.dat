5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, <b>Wallace</b> <b>is</b> mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored.
