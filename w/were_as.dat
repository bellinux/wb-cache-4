40|$|It is hard {{to avoid}} the {{assessment}} that the most visible product to date {{of the war on}} terrorism has been nothing much more, or less, than more war and more terror. The unhappy reality since September 11 seems to be that all our major cities, and concentrations of Westerners anywhere, <b>are</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable as ever; the capacity of terrorist actors to do harm <b>is</b> <b>as</b> great as ever; their motivations <b>are</b> <b>as</b> great as ever; their identity <b>is</b> <b>as</b> elusive as ever; international cooperation <b>is</b> <b>as</b> fragile as ever; and international policy priorities <b>are</b> <b>as</b> misplaced as ever...|$|R

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size <b>were</b> <b>as</b> high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern <b>were</b> <b>as</b> likely to be victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against {{people who may have}} been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|After the Declaration of Independence, Congress {{continued}} {{to manage the}} war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the Board of War in 1777. He advocated paying bonuses to Continental Army soldiers {{to encourage them to}} reenlist {{for the duration of the}} war. He called for harsh state legislation to punish Loyalists—Americans who {{continued to}} support the British crown—who Adams believed <b>were</b> <b>as</b> dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated. After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government.|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo <b>were</b> <b>as</b> large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units <b>were</b> <b>as</b> a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, most {{battles in}} the 4th century <b>were,</b> <b>as</b> in {{previous}} centuries, primarily infantry encounters, with cavalry playing a supporting role. The main qualification is that on the Eastern frontier, cavalry played a more prominent role, due to the Persian reliance on cavalry as their main arm. This obliged the Romans to strengthen their own cavalry element, in particular by {{increasing the number of}} cataphracti.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these <b>were,</b> <b>as</b> yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain was {{not made}} a Privy Councillor.

5|$|City {{missed out}} on {{promotion}} {{and as a result}} had to cut their wage budget. However, Colbeck, whose contract had expired, was offered a new three-year deal on improved terms. He turned down the offer and stayed at the club on a week-to-week basis on his previous terms. He was watched in a pre-season friendly playing for City against Bradford Park Avenue by his former Darlington boss Dave Penney, who had since been appointed Oldham Athletic manager. Colbeck started the season with Bradford and played another five games, bringing his total to the club to 109, of which 41 <b>were</b> <b>as</b> substitute.|$|E

5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses <b>were</b> <b>as</b> high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{retained}} {{his place}} in the first team {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season. He started each of the first fifteen League games, despite suffering a facial injury on 26 September 1999 in which he lost a tooth. The run of starting appearances came to an end on 27 October, when he damaged knee ligaments in a match against Ipswich Town. During the subsequent absence, Manchester City signed Robert Taylor, and most of Dickov's appearances in the second half of the season <b>were</b> <b>as</b> a substitute. One of these substitute appearances was the final match of the season, a 4–1 win at Blackburn. Dickov scored the third Manchester City goal as City clinched promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
