25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
500|$|Several {{of those}} {{affected}} {{by the events of}} the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what became New Hampshire. [...] A larger group of men were uncertain where to go, so they contacted Roger Williams who suggested that they purchase land from the Narragansett people along the Narragansett Bay, near his settlement of Providence Plantations. [...] John Clarke apparently did both, based on what he wrote in his book: [...] "By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer before , I went to the North to be somewhat cooler, but the winter following [...] proved so cold, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> in the spring to make towards the South." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2013, FinMkt {{arranged}} to acquire NowStreet Journal, a crowdfinancing educational platform. NowStreet’s founder, Dara Albright, became FinMkt's Chief Strategy Officer. In June 2014, FinMkt {{filed a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging a breach of agreement by former partner Dara Albright. FinMkt claimed that Albright regretted having sold NowStreet for only $5,000, and {{that as a result}} of the deal FinMkt owned a third of Lendit. Albright filed a countersuit denying FinMkt's ownership of NowStreet and claiming she had been “fraudulently induced” to sell. “It is unfortunate that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> to file this action,” said Cox. “We intend to let the facts speak for themselves, and we have the utmost confidence the courts will rule in our favor." ...|$|E
500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E

After an awkward silence {{on the deck of the}} royal yacht El-Mahrousa, Naguib reminded Farouk that until the 1942 standoff with the British the army had been loyal to the monarchy, but that things had changed since then. Naguib said, [...] "Sir, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> to do what we did," [...] to which Farouk replied, [...] "Yes, I know. Your mission is a difficult one. As you know, governing Egypt is not an easy task." [...] Naguib later stated [...] "I could not feel joy for his defeat".|$|E
2500|$|When Nava and his {{production}} crew were, more or less, {{kicked out of}} Mexico during the film shoot, he had to re-create a Mexican village in California. [...] Nava said: [...] "We were filming in Mexico during {{the end of the}} López Portillo presidency, one of the last of the old-fashioned caciques to rule Mexico. One day, men with machine guns took over the set. I had guns pointed at my head. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> to shut down production, bribe our way out of the country, fight to get our costumes back, and start shooting again in California. Ironically, in the United States our extras were real Mayan refugees. They were the people the movie was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, his presbytery {{sought to}} remove Bemies from his {{position}} at the church in McClellandtown, but he continued to serve when his congregation refused to accept any other pastor. [...] Bemies later wrote about the circumstances leading to the attempt to remove him as pastor:"Our greatest drawback in the church work was the presence of several exceedingly active gossips and trouble makers. [...] After four years of patient endurance {{the success of the}} work demanded that the practice stop, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>forced</b> to suspend a sister who was addicted to the habit. [...] She immediately gathered on her side the other trouble makers, including the church boss and a few relatives and hangers-on, {{both in and out of}} the church. [...] A majority leaders of Presbytery secured enough votes to forcibly remove me by vote from the official pastorate of the church against the unanimous vote and the protest of the congregation upholding me. [...] It made no difference with the work, for I went right on just the same as before under the employment of the church as their supply." ...|$|E
