500|$|Averell's main force {{continued}} southward at 1:00am on August 7. The {{force was}} led {{by a group of}} scouts dressed in Confederate uniforms, while the main force followed far enough behind that they could not be detected. The scouts were led by Captain Thomas R. Kerr of the 14th Pennsylvania Cavalry, and his men were selected specifically for this mission. While the scouts led the advance, the main body followed at a distance—and had to frequently stop while the scouts made sure it was safe for the main force to proceed. Many of the men would [...] "lie down by the road side, bridle rein in hand, [...] snatch a few minutes of sleep" [...] while waiting for the scouts to signal it <b>was</b> <b>OK</b> to continue. At about 2:30am, Kerr's scouts deceived and captured a two-man picket from Johnson's Brigade.

500|$|However, {{the episode}} {{prominently}} features and mocks animal rights and environmental activist Paul Watson and his Animal Planet reality series, Whale Wars. Watson has received wide criticism for his method of disrupting whale hunts by at times attacking and sinking Japanese and Norwegian whaling ships. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] presents Watson and his {{show in a}} way that mocks his attempts to garner media attention by simply lying rather than doing anything productive. The episode mocks Whale Wars and its attempts to present mundane ship-board activities as dramatic television. This is particularly illustrated in newspaper headlines after Stan takes over Watson's ship: [...] "New Captain Turns Vegan Pussies Into Real Pirates" [...] and [...] "Whale Wars Gets Better: Things Actually Happen!" [...] Watson himself is also portrayed in a physically unflattering way, with his stomach too fat to be entirely covered by his shirt. [...] "Whale Whores" [...] also refers to the criticisms that Watson bends the truth in order to further his popularity. This is particularly reflected through the fictional interview with Larry King, who calls Watson [...] "an unorganized, incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone <b>was</b> <b>OK</b> as long as it served his cause". The fact that Whale Wars gets better ratings after Stan takes over and employs more violent tactics is a satire of the tendency in Whale Wars, and television in general, to exploit violence for money and viewership.|$|E
500|$|... "200" [...] {{features}} {{jokes and}} references to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies. The episode revolves heavily around {{efforts to bring}} Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule. Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part tenth season episode [...] "Cartoon Wars", during which they attempt to show {{an image of the}} prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the fifth season episode [...] "Super Best Friends", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in [...] "200".) The episode [...] "Super Best Friends" [...] aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in [...] "200" [...] by saying of Muhammad, [...] "I saw him once...a while ago..." [...] This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, [...] "Something that <b>was</b> <b>OK</b> is now not OK, and that's just fucked up." [...] The [...] "Super Best Friends" [...] episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.|$|E
