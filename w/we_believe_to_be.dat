Meryman, including the well known frontispiece [...] "Peacock amid foliage", and the heavily criticised images of wood ducks, blue jays against snow, roseate spoonbills and flamingoes [...] "at dawn or sunset, and the skies they picture". The last 4 colored plates are of caterpillars. Gerald Thayer claims that [...] "The illustrations {{are of particular}} importance, inasmuch as they include what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first scientific paintings ever published of animals lighted as they actually are in nature".|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{said that}} an {{official}} inquiry that began after the arrests revealed that an Israeli passport factory had been issuing New Zealand passports. [...] "We {{turned up a}} very small number that emanated from what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Israeli intelligence. Those passports have been cancelled and it would be futile to attempt to use them." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Johnson {{responded to}} a {{complaint}} from President Tito that Israel could change the frontiers without Arab consent: [...] "You note that the Arabs feel the US interprets the draft resolution to imply a change of frontiers to their detriment. We have no preconceptions on frontiers as such. What <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important is that the frontiers be secure. For this the single most vital condition is that they be acceptable to both sides. It {{is a source of}} regret to us that the Arabs appear to misunderstand our proposal and misread our motives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Russian Arktika 2007 expedition, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Peter MacKay, said [...] "his is posturing. This is the true north strong and free, and they're fooling themselves if they think dropping a flag {{on the ocean floor}} is going to change anything... This isn't the 14th or 15th century." [...] In response, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated [...] "hen pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way... e from the outset said that this expedition was part of the big work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the international authority where Russia's claim to submerged ridges which <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an extension of our shelf is being considered. We know that this has to be proved. The ground samples that were taken will serve the work to prepare that evidence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another dispute {{centers on}} {{funding of the}} Caskey School of Divinity. The Cason Foundation, which had donated $5 million to LC to fund the school, {{announced}} that it will no longer financially support the college because of [...] "actions of President Aguillard which <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unethical and potentially illegal." [...] Edgar D. Cason and his wife, Flora Jean Caskey Cason, of Coushatta in Red River Parish, who established the foundation, informed LC trustees by letter on April 15, 2013, that the foundation was terminating its ties to LC. A probe conducted by a law firm in New Orleans claims that Aguillard had improperly diverted nearly $60,000 in divinity school donations to LC projects in Tanzania, Africa. A committee of five LC board members, however, defended Aguillard and maintain that he did not act improperly regarding the funds. Cason, a wealthy timber operator, farmer, and cattleman, has supported conservative Republican candidates, including Santorum for President, and issues, such as the Louisiana Values Political Action Committee. Cason questioned why the LC trustees did not permit him to address the board at its March meeting.|$|E

60|$|Applying {{this remark}} to physiology, {{we see that}} the nerves and brain as {{physical}} objects are not truly data; they are to be replaced, in the ideal structure of science, by the sensations through which the physiologist is said to perceive them. The passage from these sensations to nerves and brain as physical objects belongs really to the initial stage in the theory of physics, and ought to be placed in the reasoned part, not in the part supposed to be observed. To say we see the nerves is like saying we hear the nightingale; both are convenient but inaccurate expressions. We hear a sound which <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> causally connected with the nightingale, and we see a sight which <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> causally connected with a nerve. But in each case it is only the sensation that ought, in strictness, to be called a datum. Now, sensations are certainly among the data of psychology. Therefore all the data of the physical sciences are also psychological data. It remains to inquire whether all the data of psychology are also data of physical science, and especially of physiology.|$|E

6000|$|In all science {{we have to}} {{distinguish}} two sorts of laws: first, those that are empirically verifiable but probably only approximate; secondly, {{those that are not}} verifiable, but may be exact.

I had the pleasure to see the paws or feet of this nettle move, and having placed the vase full of water in which the coral was, near the fire, at a moderate heat, all the little insects expanded, the nettle stretched out its feet and formed what M. de Marsigli and I had taken for the petals of the flower. The calyx of this so-called flower is the very body of the animal issued from its cell."] ...|$|E
60|$|We {{will not}} take {{advantage}} of this last passage to charge M. Comte with teaching, after the fashion of Hegel, that there can be thought without things thought of. We are content simply to compare the two assertions, that analysis arose out of the contemplation of geometrical and mechanical facts, and that geometrical conceptions are founded upon analytical ones. Literally interpreted they exactly cancel each other. Interpreted, however, in a liberal sense, they imply, what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demonstrable, that the two had a simultaneous origin. The passage is either nonsense, or it is an admission that abstract and concrete mathematics are coeval. Thus, at the very first step, the alleged congruity between the order of generality and the order of evolution does not hold good.|$|E

5000|$|Along with Walker {{there were}} Elizabeth Hamilton, Robert Bisset, Henry James Pye, Charles Lloyd, Jane West, and Edward Dubois.
