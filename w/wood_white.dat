5|$|White {{was one of}} two {{physicians}} {{practicing in}} Frederick County along with Daniel Hart (died about 1748). White practiced from his residence near Great North Mountain, and one of his more notable patients was Colonel James Wood, founder of Winchester, Virginia. White's son Alexander married Wood's daughter, Elizabeth <b>Wood.</b> <b>White</b> was part a larger wave of Scottish physicians who settled in Virginia prior to the American Revolutionary War. White's alma mater, the University of Edinburgh, was a leading center of medical education and research, and the school trained more physicians than were needed in Scotland. Unlike White, the majority of Scottish physicians practiced in the main centers of population in the colonial port cities.|$|E
2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), <b>wood</b> <b>white</b> (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E
