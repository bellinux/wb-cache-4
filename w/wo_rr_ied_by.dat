In the mid 1980s he helped establish Ramos Rosado <b>y</b> Asociados [...] (<b>RR</b> <b>y</b> Asc), a commercial insurance broker and risk management firm (now AON), in Mexico City. At its peak, <b>RR</b> <b>y</b> Asc had in its portfolio some of the largest corporations in Mexico, including all of the major airlines that flew in and out of Mexico, as well as many other notable Fortune 500 companies such as Purina, BIC and GE. <b>By</b> 1990, <b>RR</b> <b>y</b> Asc employed over 300 people with offices in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Cancun and other major cities throughout Mexico. He was instrumental in attracting to Mexico, Towers Watson, one of the largest actuarial firms in the world. In 2001, he established RYACSA, “Rosado y Asociados Consultores, Soluciones Actuariales, S.A. de C.V". which, after his death, continues to prosper.|$|R

40|$|Development of {{glyphosate}} resistant transgenes {{started in}} the early 1980 s and was commercially introduced in soybean varieties in 1996 as Roundup Ready?(hereafter referred to as RR 1) (SourceWatch, 2012). Producers perceived that the more effective, easier, and less expensive weed control associated with these varieties outweighed the economic loss from lower yields (Gurian-Sherman, 2009). In 2008, the Roundup Ready 2 Yield varieties were commercialized as Genuity?Roundup Ready 2 Yield?(hereafter referred to as <b>RR</b> 2 <b>Y)</b> in 2010 (SourceWatch, 2012). <b>RR</b> 2 <b>Y</b> soybean varieties have been rapidly replacing the RR 1 varieties in the marketplace...|$|R

30|$|The {{actual yield}} {{reduction}} in RoundupReady soybean observed in some studies [15] {{might be due}} to several causes: (i) the present resistance gene in the first generation of RoundupReady line (40 - 3 - 2) [18] and (ii) reduced nodular nitrogen fixation upon glyphosate application [19] and/or (iii) a weaker defence response [20]. Application of glyphosate seemed to affect nodule number and mass which have been correlated with nitrogen fixation [21] and cause the symptom of “yellow flashing” which leads to a decrease in grain yield (see discussion in [9]). The second generation <b>RR</b> 2 <b>Y</b> soybean (MON 89788) was introduced to provide better yields, but when tested in the greenhouse, different cultivars of <b>RR</b> 2 <b>Y</b> performed less well than RR 40 - 3 - 2 [22].|$|R
