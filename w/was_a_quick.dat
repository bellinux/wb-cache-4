5|$|A win at the World 10K Bangalore, {{where he}} beat Moses Kipsiro in 27:51, was the {{highlight}} of a low-key build up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In August, Zersenay was among some forty runners competing for the medals in the 10,000 metres Olympic final. Zersenay's brother, Kidane, was also competing and he led for most of first half of what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> race. Zersenay Tadese had the lead at the 7–8000m mark but Bekele and Sihine sprinted into first and second. Although Zersenay's time almost equalled the previous Olympic record for the event, he ended up one second behind Kenyans Moses Masai and Micah Kogo, taking fifth place overall.|$|E

5|$|The {{activity}} in the first twomonths of the season were limited in tropical cyclogenesis, with the second tropical depression of the season not developing until July 22. Following that, the season was very active, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> succession of tropical cyclone development from late-July to mid-August. The Atlantic briefly remained dormant, and activity resumed on August 24 {{with the development of}} Tropical Depression Eight (Hurricane Gustav). Although August was a very active month, there were only two named storms in September, both of which became hurricanes. Activity in October was high then average, with five tropical cyclones to either form or exist in the month. Following an active October, no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in the final month of the season, which is November.|$|E
5|$|Zakuani was a right-footed {{player who}} {{preferred}} {{being on the}} left of the field. He played on the left wing in a 4–4–2 formation with Arsenal; later he was a forward in college before converting to a winger professionally. Zakuani said he played with a style he learned at Arsenal's youth academy and that he tried to emulate the style of former winger Robert Pirès. Zakuani often sought advice from former Arsenal star Fredrik Ljungberg when they played together in Seattle. Zakuani <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> agile player who liked to take defenders one-on-one. While coaching him at Akron, Porter said many of Zakuani's goals came after long runs that beat multiple players.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Horvath {{attended}} Ohio State University on a work scholarship, {{but managed}} to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a disappointment in 1940, however, finishing {{the season with a}} 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio high school coach who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level of discipline and organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.|$|E

25|$|A {{prolific}} goalscorer and {{a highly}} creative forward, Raúl is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest and most consistent strikers of his generation. Wearing the number 7 jersey for most of his club and international career, he was capable of playing anywhere along the front line, although he was primarily deployed as a centre-forward, or as a supporting striker. Raúl <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> left-footed player, who was capable of scoring both in and outside the penalty area with his accurate and powerful shot. He possessed excellent ball control and technical ability, and was effective in the air as well as with his feet.|$|E

25|$|A hard-working, {{versatile}} and technically gifted player, McManaman was usually deployed as a winger, or occasionally {{as a central}} midfielder; his preferred position, however, {{was that of a}} more offensive and creative attacking midfielder, an uncommon position in the Premier League throughout his career. McManaman <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> strong, creative, and energetic player, with good dribbling ability, as well as accurate passing and crossing ability with either foot, which allowed him to create chances and provide assists for teammates as a playmaker. He was often criticised, however, for his inability to score many goals, although he would later improve upon this element of his game during his career.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} players in his position, Rijkaard <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> strong, complete and tenacious defensive midfielder who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute tactical intelligence and decision-making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game. Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Rijkaard was a strong tackler, with good technique and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession. He also possessed a powerful shot.|$|E
25|$|Zanetti <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> {{strong and}} {{physically}} fit player in his prime, with outstanding physical attributes, excellent ball control, dribbling, technical ability and acceleration. Defensively, he excelled at reading the game, {{and he was}} a good ball-winner and man-marker, although he was also effective at distributing the ball to teammates, due to his passing range and vision. A two-way and two-footed player, he excelled at playing on either flank, where he was capable of advancing into more offensive positions to cross balls for teammates. He also possessed an accurate shot from distance. During his later years at Inter, he was known to have developed a formidable partnership with fellow full-back Maicon, leading the club to win several titles.|$|E

25|$|Camoranesi was a dynamic, hard-working, and skilful midfielder, {{who usually}} {{deployed}} {{on the right}} wing, or on occasion as a central or attacking midfielder behind the strikers. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> energetic, and technically gifted player, with excellent ball control, who excelled at dribbling and beating players in one on one situations. He was also gifted with good vision, crossing and passing ability with his right foot, which allowed him to create chances for his teammates. In addition to these characteristics, he also had an accurate and powerful shot, and was known for both his offensive and defensive contribution. A tenacious winger, throughout his career, he was however criticised for his aggression and lack of discipline at times, which caused him to pick up unnecessary bookings.|$|E
25|$|Figo is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest players of his generation, and one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time. At his physical peak, Figo <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> elegant, highly skilful player with a dribbling ability that allowed him to frequently take on and beat defenders in one on one situations. He would often employ feints to beat opponents, such as stepovers. Figo was usually deployed as a winger in his early career, where he was capable of providing several assists, due to his ability to provide curling crosses to teammates from the flank, or cut inside, link-up with midfielders, and create goalscoring opportunities. He has made the second most assists in La Liga history behind Lionel Messi.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} {{in the region and}} in particular his perceived Labour sympathies at that time led to Clement Attlee appointing him Viceroy of India on 20 February 1947 charged with overseeing the transition of British India to independence no later than 30 June 1948. Mountbatten's instructions emphasised a united India {{as a result of the}} transference of power but authorised him to adapt to a changing situation in order to get Britain out promptly with minimal reputational damage. Soon after he arrived, Mountbatten concluded that the situation was too volatile for even that short a wait. Although his advisers favoured a gradual transfer of independence, Mountbatten decided the only way forward <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and orderly transfer of independence before 1947 was out. In his view, any longer would mean civil war. The Viceroy also hurried so he could return to his senior technical Navy courses.|$|E
