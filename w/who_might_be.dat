5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death {{was not a}} {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze {{is not part of}} the procession, but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28–23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested, may be engaged in the dokimasia, the tryout or enrollment of the knights. W24 is an ambiguous figure <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.|$|E
5|$|With {{the public}} {{suspicious}} of immigrants, especially those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> socialists or communists, Congress passed the Per Centum Act of 1921, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, {{as a quick}} means of restricting immigration. The act reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3% of those from a given country living in the U.S., based on the 1910 census. This would, in practice, not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany, but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews. Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane, and at the secretary's recommendation, Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable immigrants to remain. Coolidge signed a bill permanently restricting immigration to the U.S. in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Later in 711, al-Hajjaj ordered Qutayba {{to march}} against the Hephthalite kingdom of Zabulistan, whose ruler, titled Zunbil, had long {{remained}} an indomitable {{thorn in the}} Arabs' side and menaced their province of Sistan. Repeated expeditions against him had failed, and a truce had been agreed in exchange for tribute. In addition, {{the existence of a}} free Zabulite kingdom was a threat to the security of Muslim control over the Hephthalite principalities of Tokharistan, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> encouraged to seek support from it. Thus Qutayba led a large army south, but the Zunbil readily offered his submission and the payment of tribute. Satisfied with this easy success, and unwilling to hazard a campaign in the mountains of Zabulistan, Qutayba departed. No garrisons were installed, {{and as soon as the}} Arab army had departed, the Zunbil ceased the payment of tribute. Qutayba's victories, parallel with the conquests of Muhammad ibn Qasim in northwestern India, awoke such enthusiasm and hopes among the Muslims that al-Hajjaj is reputed to have offered the governorship of China to whomever of the two first reached it.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because {{it was believed that}} they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E
