5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped flowers in the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E

Two running plays set up third down and two, then Vick completed a 50-yard pass to Kendrick, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a first down at the Clemson four-yard line. From there, it took Suggs two rushes to pass the goal line for Virginia Tech's third touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 2110 with 2:26 before halftime.|$|E
5|$|Latter Days {{was filmed}} in several {{locations}} in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget. After Cox had financed {{the search for}} initial backing, funding was acquired from private investors who {{wanted to see the}} film made. However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E
5|$|After 28 games, {{over two}} seasons, with the Capitals, Linden had scored only four goals and three assists. On November 10, 2001, the Capitals traded Linden {{with a second}} round draft pick in either 2002 or 2003 (Denis Grot) to the Canucks for their first round pick in 2002 (Boyd Gordon) and a third round pick in 2003 (later traded to Edmonton <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> Zack Stortini). He scored 34 points with Vancouver in 64 games, which {{included}} his 1,000th regular season game on March 26, 2002, against the Los Angeles Kings.

5|$|Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk to reporters {{following}} the loss. Vick, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in that game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology was made. In {{the wake of the}} incident, Virginia Tech officials announced that they would be conducting a review of Vick's conduct on and off the field.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{began their}} drive with a seven-yard pass from Druckenmiller to Marcus Parker. Oxendine then ran ahead and gained {{a first down}} at the 46-yard line. From there, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 28-yard pass to Jennings at the Texas 26-yard line. Oxendine was tackled after a gain of two yards, then Tech was penalized five yards for an illegal shift. After being pushed back to the 30-yard line, Druckenmiller completed a 28-yard pass to Still, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a first down at the Texas two-yard line. On the next play, Parker rushed through the Texas defense for the Hokies' first offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and with 2:32 remaining in the third quarter, Virginia Tech took its first lead of the game.|$|E
5|$|With Montreal, Linden {{was often}} injured, and only {{appeared}} in 50 games {{during his first}} season with the Canadiens, scoring 30 points, while the next year he appeared in 57 games, scoring 33 points. While with the Canadiens, he signed a four-year contract worth $15 million; however, he was traded {{for the third time}} in his career, this time to the Washington Capitals, going with Dainius Zubrus, and New Jersey's 2nd round choice in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (later traded to Tampa Bay <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> Andreas Holmqvist) in exchange for Richard Zednik, Jan Bulis, and Washington's 1st round choice in the 2001 Draft (Alexander Perezhogin).

5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Following the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return, Nebraska's offense {{began work}} at its 21-yard line. Three rushes by as many {{different}} players—Joel Makovicka, Damon Benning, and Jay Sims—resulted in 11 yards and a first down. During Sims' run, Tech's Loren Johnson committed a 15-yard personal foul facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47-yard line. From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, the Cornhuskers executed a quick four-yard rush to the Tech 11-yard line. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Virginia Tech led Nebraska, 70, but the Cornhuskers were in scoring position.|$|E
5|$|Like {{their opponents}} in the final, Somerset joined the tournament in the second round, facing Derbyshire. Bowling first, Somerset limited their opponents to 224; Joel Garner was their most {{economical}} bowler. In reply, Somerset captain and opening batsman Brian Rose remained not out on 88 when his side reached their winning target with 3.5 overs remaining, having lost two wickets. Kent travelled to Taunton for the quarter-final, in which Somerset chose to bat first after winning the toss. Only Graham Burgess reached a half-century for Somerset against a bowling attack which included five Test players. In Kent's reply, Garner claimed five wickets and Ian Botham three as Somerset bowled their opponents out for 60 runs. Against Middlesex in the semi-final, Somerset's bowlers were once again led by Garner, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up four wickets as the London-based club were dismissed for 185. Somerset won with 9.4 overs remaining {{for the loss of}} three wickets and Peter Denning remained unbeaten on 90.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November, {{assistant}} manager Matthew Gill left the club by mutual consent. Rovers defeated Bristol Rovers in the First Round of FA Cup {{thanks to a}} Max Power goal on 54th minute. Three days later Tranmere upheld their good cup form in the Football League Trophy with an away victory at Bury. After narrow defeats against Luton Town and Southend United, Tranmere finally achieved their first league victory under Micky Adams on 29 November against Portsmouth. The win was clouded by the serious injury of young loanee Will Aimson, who fractured both his tibia and fibula in a collision with teammate Danny Holmes. 17-year old defender Evan Gumbs made his first appearance for the senior team against Luton Town as a second-half substitute, following an injury to Josh Thompson <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a hamstring injury on his Tranmere debut.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 16-yard pass to Cornelius White, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Texas then committed a five-yard offsides penalty before Oxendine ran forward for four yards. On the next play, Oxendine fumbled the ball after {{being hit by a}} Texas defender. The loose ball was picked up by a Texas defender, who returned it to the 50-yard line. Brown threw two incomplete passes, then Tech committed a five-yard penalty. On third down, Brown completed a 21-yard pass to Davis, who gained a first down at the Tech 24-yard line. After the long gain, Brown threw two more incomplete passes. On third down, Brown threw another interception to Gray, who returned the ball to the Tech 31-yard line and allowed the Hokies' offense to return to the field with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{over after}} the missed field goal, Georgia Tech {{was unable to}} gain a first down. After the Yellow Jackets punted the ball away, Wake Forest {{continued}} to have the increased offensive success they had shown in their previous drive. This time, it was running back Kenneth Moore <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> {{up the majority of}} the Deacons' yardage, as he carried the ball eight times during the drive. Toward the end of the drive, Wake Forest was assisted by a 10-yard penalty against the Yellow Jackets, which drove them inside Georgia Tech's red zone. There, however, Tech's defense stiffened. Despite having a first down at Tech's 10-yard line, Wake was unable to score a touchdown. Kicker Sam Swank again came into the game to attempt a field goal, and connected on a 19-yard field goal. The kick tied the score at 33 with just 58 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear in the same order as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech won the {{traditional}} pre-game coin toss and elected {{to kick off}} to Nebraska to begin the game. The Hokie kickoff was returned to the Nebraska 25-yard line, where the Cornhuskers ran the first play of the game. On that first play, Frost completed a five-yard pass to Brendan Holbein. This was followed by two rushes by Benning, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up 18 yards and a first down in the process. Benning then crossed into the Virginia Tech half of the field with a five-yard rush. Frost then threw an incomplete pass, and Benning was unable to pick up another first down after gaining two yards on a pass from Frost. Nebraska punter Jesse Kosch came on to the field to punt to Virginia Tech. The kick sailed {{into the end zone}} for a touchback, and Virginia Tech began its first possession at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On the next play, Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, <b>who</b> <b>picked</b> up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On the next play, Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on the next play. With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
