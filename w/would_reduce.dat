5|$|A second {{improvement}} project involves {{building a}} pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center {{with the western}} mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart. The proposed connection <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> the number of passengers that use the Red Line to transfer between the Yellow Line and the Blue and Orange lines at Metro Center. As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|Although a 2007 study {{estimated}} that introducing DST to Japan <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> household lighting energy consumption, a 2007 simulation {{estimated that}} DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to extra cooling; neither study examined non-residential energy use. This is probably because DST's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences.|$|E

50|$|Polaritonics, like {{electronics}} and photonics, requires three elements: robust waveform generation, detection, and guidance and control. Without all three, polaritonics <b>would</b> be <b>reduced</b> to just phonon-polaritons, just as {{electronics and}} photonics <b>would</b> be <b>reduced</b> to just electromagnetic radiation.

5|$|At that time, many in Britain {{worried that}} coal {{reserves}} were rapidly dwindling, {{but some experts}} opined that improving technology <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase {{the rate at which}} England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{explore the}} {{strength}} of female secondary education relative to, and in combination with, family planning and health programs in reducing fertility and infant mortality. They find that family planning and health programs do influence fertility and mortality, but {{that the impact of}} expanding female secondary enrollments appears to be much greater, especially in countries with low female secondary enrollment. Fertility and infant mortality are more elastic with respect to female secondary education than to family planning and health programs. Their simulations suggest the following. Doubling female secondary school enrollment (from 19 to 38 percent) in 1975 <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> the total fertility rate in 1985 from 5. 3 to 3. 9. Doubling the family planning service score (from 25 to 50 percent) in 1982 <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> the total fertility rate only from 5. 5 to 5. 0. Doubling female secondary school enrollment in 1975 from 19 to 38 <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> the infant mortality rate from 81 to 38. Halving the ratio of population per physician <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> the infant mortality rate only from 85 to 81. Doubling per capita GDP from $ 650 to $ 1, 300 <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> the infant mortality rate only from 98 to 92. Doubling female secondary school enrollment (from 19 to 38) in 1975 would have lowered the number of births by 29 percent of the 1985 number. Doubling family planning services <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> it by 3. 5 percent. Doubling female secondary school enrollment <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> infant deaths by 64 percent. Halving the ratio of population per physician <b>would</b> have <b>reduced</b> it only by 2. 5 percent. Doubling per capita GDP has no effect on reducing infant deaths, all other factors being constant. Female education affects desired family size by raising the opportunity cost of a woman's time in economic activities, increasing demand for family planning, and promoting more effective contraceptive use.

5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{that more}} {{settlers}} <b>would</b> <b>reduce</b> the near-constant Comanche raids, Mexican Texas liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain.
