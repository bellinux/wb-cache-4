50|$|As the {{disaster}} at Three Mile Island {{could have been}} avoided with prior planning and a <b>water</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicator,</b> the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has started to push for water level controllers. The controller would regulate water to the reactor using a combination of sensors such as feedback controllers and feed-forward controllers. Yet this {{is only one of many}} such devices that ensure the safe and efficient production of power by nuclear reaction. Other tools include the control rods, relief valves, and even back up cooling systems. The control rods work by reducing the amount of radiation produced. They are built of a material that absorbs neutrons, and therefore reduces the number of fission reactions that take place inside the reactor. Relief valves function to vent pressure, sometimes into the atmosphere, in order to protect the system as a whole. And if the worst were to happen and a meltdown was occurring, a reservoir of cooling water waiting in standby could mean the difference between a disaster and a minor incident.|$|E

Two conditions are always {{necessary for the}} motor to run. The overhead tank {{to be filled with}} water should be dirt free and there should be enough water at the source from which water is to be drawn. When this two condition are satisfied the motor will run and start filling up the tank. After the water touch a certain level {{at the top of the}} overhead tank, the motor will stop running automatically and prevent the overflow of water. Water level will decrease due to the utilization of water but the motor will still be in off mode state.

30|$|The wells {{were chosen}} as follows. First, we chose wells that were located {{no more than}} 10 km from active faults (Central Geological Survey, 2000). The well <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data of WRA were used to check for {{artificial}} disturbances {{and the effects of}} rainfall. However, some of the chosen wells still show relatively large artificial disturbances. The effects on rainfall can be roughly divided into two types, based on duration. The first, which we call short-term rainfall effects, occurs just after a rainfall and continues for a few to several days. In confined groundwater, this effect is probably related to the loading of the rainfall. The second, which we call long-term rainfall effects, starts some time after the rainfall and continues for > 10 days, and seems to show a recharge and discharge of groundwater. Long-term rainfall effects are hard to avoid. An analysis of well <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data with barometric pressure data by BAYTAP-G (Tamura et al., 1991), a tidal analysis program, reveals barometric and tidal responses of the well <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The barometric response is an indicator of the confinement of well water: if the well <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is independent of sea level, that is to say, the aquifer of the well is not connected to the sea, the tidal response of the well <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is an <b>indicator</b> of strain sensitivity. We compared the change in tidal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> to a theoretical tidal volumetric strain calculated from GOTIC 2 (Matsumoto et al., 2001), which calculates the theoretical earth and ocean tides, and estimated the strain sensitivity of the well <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Finally, we checked whether there were any earthquake-related well <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes. Using this step-wise procedure, by 2005 we had finally selected 12 wells from among the 550 wells of the WRA for our investigation of earthquake-related groundwater changes. We also constructed four new wells, thereby establishing a network of 16 wells in total. Each of these wells has only one screen, with the depths of the screens ranging from 80 to 252 m. Groundwater level and background information, such as atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall, are collected at all wells, while groundwater temperature and radon concentration are collected at only some of the wells and are recorded at 2 -min intervals. The data are automatically sent to the Disaster Prevention Research Center (DPRC) at National Cheng-Kung University. The accuracy of the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data for the 16 wells is 2 mm according to the manufacturer of the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> meter.

40|$|Overtopping {{and damage}} to sea {{defenses}} {{tends to be}} associated with times of large waves occurring in combination with high <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods for predicting extremes of either <b>water</b> <b>level</b> or waves are in common use, but assessment of the joint probability of high waves and high <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is more important. The combination of these phenomena leads to extremely high <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> increasing the risk of coastal flooding. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the probability of joint occurrences of high waves and high <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> The in-situ data during typhoons are analyzed. Marginal distributions for wave and <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data during typhoons are examined. Furthermore, the joint probability diagram of waves and <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is presented. Results of design <b>water</b> <b>level</b> from joint probability method (JPM) are compared with traditional empirical design approach by frequency analysis. It is shown that the commonly used empirical method may lead to overestimation of the design <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> 1...|$|R
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in Devils Hole is {{monitored}} daily by the National Park Service and occasionally by the U.S. Geological Survey. During the late 1960s, the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> dropped dramatically {{in response to}} pumping in the Ash Meadows area, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the cavern. After the cessation of pumping, the <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> recovered until about 1986, when the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> began to decline. Pronounced changes in the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> resulted in response to the 1992 Landers/Little Skull Mountain earthquakes and the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. Since December 2005, the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in Devils Hole has been rising, and by December 2008, the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> had risen to its highest level since 1993.|$|R
40|$|Well <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> and ditch flow {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} road-induced changes in surface and subsurface flow for two sites (Trocadero and Polk) in southeast Alaska. At the Trocadero Site, low <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> before and peak <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> during a storm {{were used to}} test for differences in subsurface <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> above and below an existing road. Low <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> at the Trocadero Site were significantly different in the wells above verses below the road (p = 0. 02). However, peak <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> {{above and below the}} road showed no significant difference (p = 0. 25). Low <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> before and peak <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> during a storm were used to test for changes in subsurface <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> pre- and post-road construction at the Polk Site. Four storms were measured prior to road construction. Thirty-one storms were measured following road construction. Using an Antecedent Precipitation Index, fifteen storms from the post-road construction dataset were selected that were within similar moisture conditions as the pre-road storms. After road construction there was no significant change in low <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> There was a small (0. 08 m and 0. 05 m), but significant (p = 0. 01 and 0. 03), decrease in the peak <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> following road construction...|$|R
