40|$|Residents of wards 12 and 13 in Mberengwa {{depend on}} {{subsistence}} agriculture for their livelihoods. These residents incorporate <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> in agricultural decision-making especially in decisions {{that relate to}} crop production. The residents of the two wards have since developed their own indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems that they use in conjunction with meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> for agricultural planning purposes. This study examines {{the perceptions of the}} residents of wards 12 and 13 on the levels of accuracy of indigenous and meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The data was collected using questionnaires and focus, group discussions. Purposive sampling was used to select the respondents. 66 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> accuracy fell in the average to good rating while 59 % indicated that they rated meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> as average to good. Comparative ratings of the accuracy of indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> to meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> showed that 91 % of the respondents who had access to both meteorological and indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> perceived the indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> as being more reliable than meteorological <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The study recommends an in-depth research of the indigenous <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems so that the locals may fully benefit from this simple, inexpensive and easily accessible system of <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting...</b>|$|R

5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> {{must be taken into account}} to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) and Environment Canada's Meteorological Service (MSC). Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State <b>Weather</b> <b>Forecast</b> offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the <b>weather</b> <b>forecast</b> office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E
30|$|In this {{research}} selected PRA tools, questionnaire survey, interviews {{were used to}} collect data. PRA (as a tool overt observation, focus group discussion) were used to collect data. A total of four focus group discussion sessions having an average of 12 participants’ each were organized {{to collect data on}} the precision of traditional <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> system, herders attitude to biotic <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> system, socio-economic preparation following <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting.</b> Overt observation was employed to understand how entrails, plant and animal body languages are interpreted by indigenous experts. Data was also gathered through in-depth interviews from Ethnobotany, veterinarian, Borena indigenous intestinal readers (Uchu) and community key informants. Questionnaire survey was employed to assess individuals’ socioeconomic preparations in view of <b>weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> and their perceptions towards the vitality of traditional <b>weather</b> <b>forecasting</b> systems. Data was collected from two slaughtered goat intestinal diagnostic. This approach was used to understand how Uchus interpreted different signs to weather events.
