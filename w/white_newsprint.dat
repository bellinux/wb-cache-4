50|$|Jim and Bette Cornwell {{came from}} Nebraska to {{purchase}} the Murray Eagle in the mid-1950s and from it spun off the Green Sheet, named for the tint of paper of the front page. Their weeklies supplemented the Salt Lake dailies by dealing with readers on a more local level than possible in the metropolitan press. They also helped give their communities an identity in the urban sprawl. The first green newspaper hit Murray's streets in 1960. Eventually, the paper forsook the green paper for traditional <b>white</b> due <b>newsprint</b> shortages and times when newsprint manufacturers didn't want to put green dye in their paper. Even being printed on white paper, the newspaper retained the Green Sheet name.|$|R

5000|$|The first Elfquest {{story was}} {{published}} in February 1978, in the underground comic book Fantasy Quarterly, published by Lansing, Michigan-based IPS (Independent Publishers Syndicate).

Casey Brennan and illustrated by Cerebus the Aardvark creator Dave Sim titled [...] "Doorway to the Gods".) The quality of the publication was disappointing to Wendy and Richard Pini. The cover paper stock was only slightly thicker and <b>whiter</b> than <b>newsprint</b> (the exterior was printed unglossed with a very limited color palette) and the paper used inside of the comic book was newsprint.|$|R
50|$|The work {{measures}} 107.3 cm by 153.8 cm. It is {{made using}} encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, {{mounted on a}} plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and <b>white</b> stripes. <b>Newsprint</b> is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, {{it is clear that}} the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.|$|R
5000|$|Magazine Special (マガジンSPECIAL) is a Japanese shōnen manga {{magazine}} {{published by}} Kodansha and first launched {{with a cover}} date of September 5, 1983. Its audience demographic is geared toward younger teenage boys, and contents tend to be predominantly sports stories and high school romantic comedies. Many of the popular series in Magazine Special were transferred there from other Kodansha publications like Weekly Shōnen Magazine after their initial run. It is issued monthly on the 20th in perfect-bound B5 format and retails for 540 yen. Issues are typically about 600 pages printed in black and <b>white</b> on heavy <b>newsprint,</b> with a few glossy pages in color. Between 20 and 30 stories appear in each issue, {{almost all of them}} installments of ongoing and frequently long-running serials by different manga artists.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recycling, waste {{papers are}} {{segregated}} into various grades {{as they are}} subjected to different recycling processes. Highly sorted paper streams facilitate high quality end products and save processing chemicals and energy. Automated paper sorting systems offer significant advantages over human inspection in terms of worker fatigue, throughput, speed, and accuracy. As a consequence, many automated mechanical and optical paper sorting methods {{have been developed to}} fill the paper sorting demand during 1932 to 2009. Because of inadequate throughput and some major drawbacks of mechanical paper sorting systems, the popularity of optical paper sorting systems has increased. The implementation of the previous methods, while being a step forward in the large-volume automated sorting technology, is still complex, expensive and sometimes offers limited reliability. This research attempts to develop a smart vision sensing system that is able to separate the different grades of paper using chromaticity. For constructing template database, hue and saturation of the paper object image in a selected area are considered. The paper grade is identified based on the maximum occurrence of a specific template in the paper object image. The classification success rates for <b>white</b> paper, old <b>newsprint</b> paper and old corrugated cardboard are 95 %, 92 % and 90 %, respectively. Finally, the best result of the proposed method is compared with the results published in literature where waste paper grade identification systems were developed using other methods. The remarkable achievement obtained with the method is the accurate identification and dynamic sorting of all grades of papers using chromaticity, which is the best among the prevailing techniques of optical or electronic image based systems...|$|R
