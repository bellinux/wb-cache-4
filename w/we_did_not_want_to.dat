500|$|Resident Evil 3 {{uses the}} same game engine as its predecessors. The environments consist of 2D pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} while moving objects such as enemies and some interactive elements consist of 3D polygon graphics. The developers chose this technique because having full 3D graphics would {{not allow them to}} create graphically rich and detailed environments. According to project supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto, [...] "the number of polygons allocated for the enemies would not be sufficient. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have blocky, pixelated zombies." [...] Interaction with the environment was improved so that the player could shoot objects like explosive barrels to damage enemies. Developers also added more variety of zombies, who can take the form of policemen, doctors, and ordinary citizens, among others.|$|E
500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

500|$|On August 3, House of Cards {{was going}} to film a presidential {{motorcade}} at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. at 3 PM. However, Chief of police Cathy L. Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD) revoked the permits that morning. An MPD spokesperson explained [...] "The Metropolitan Police Department is not the lead agency on presidential motorcades and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> portray ourselves as such". As a result, the production crews did a last minute filming of the desired scenes back in Baltimore. The next day, Mayor of the District of Columbia Vincent Gray stated that there was confusion on what role the MPD would play in the filming. A spokesperson from his office stated that [...] ""MPD {{is not going to}} rent itself out as extras for film ... That's what MPD's decision was focused on. We're not going to be actors." [...] On October 2, all issues were resolved and the motorcade was filmed as originally planned without any MPD personnel [...] "actively participate in the filming".|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and I went home and did it again. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E

500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] The race {{commenced}} at 3.40pm, in a [...] "slight drizzle". After a fast start, Cambridge took a half-length lead by Fulham. [...] Rounding the Middlesex bend, Oxford drew back into contention and the crews were level at the Mile Post {{in a time of}} 4 minutes 4 seconds. [...] On the approach to Harrods Furniture Depository, Painter, the Dark Blue cox, steered his boat so close to the Surrey shore that Douglas Calder, writing in The Times, suggested [...] "if the crews had gone any farther over they would have been practically on the towpath". After being warned twice by the umpire for steering too close to their opponents, and taking a small lead, Oxford were made to concede to the Light Blues, and Cambridge rallied. Despite rough water through Crabtree Reach, Cambridge pushed on at Hammersmith Bridge and opened an eight-second lead by the time the crews reached Chiswick Steps. [...] By Barnes Bridge they had extended their lead to twelve seconds, and passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead in a time of 18 minutes 22 seconds. [...] It was the Light Blues' first victory in four years. [...] Their cox remarked [...] "I think we could have won on a foul if I had forced a collision at Harrods.

500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, we {{obviously}} thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

The chassis has been modified to [...] "revert back to the Fabia’s original, first-generation design" [...] by becoming 90mm wider and 30mm lower, resulting in more interior and boot space.

2500|$|Looking {{for better}} {{distribution}} of their records, Big Black negotiated {{a deal with}} Homestead Records. Gerard Cosloy, who had befriended Albini through writing for Matter and gone on to work at Homestead, negotiated an unorthodox deal for the band: Big Black merely licensed their recordings to Homestead for specific lengths of time, rather than the label retaining {{the rights to the}} recordings as was typical. Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that [...] "We came from a punk perspective — <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their word. We had ideals, {{and that was one of}} our ideals." [...] The band members figured that if a record company were going to cheat them, they would be able to do so with or without a contract because the band couldn't afford to defend themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Doubts {{have been}} cast by some experts from US or Israeli-affiliated think tanks {{on either the}} {{existence}} of fatwa, its authenticity, impact, or whether only political statements that lack the authority of a religiously binding fatwa have been made. James Risen of The New York Times noted that Khamenei said “that {{it was a mistake}} for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya to give up his nuclear weapons program.” Some analysts raised the possibility that Khamenei might be lying, utilizing taqiyya, or religious dissembling. In 2015, an open letter to then president Barack Obama posted on Iranian.com, reportedly from a nephew of Ali Khamenei, stated that Khamenei is practicing the Shia doctrine of taqiya with regard to the fatwa. On November 1, 2015, The Jerusalem Post also noted that the fatwa came after the period when President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani admitted the nuclear option was explored, referring to the interview. However afterwards, according to the Iranian nuclear hope website, where Rafsanjani's interview was initially published, it was [...] "skewed by Zionist media," [...] and Rafsanjani said: [...] "there was no reason to go toward the military aspect of nuclear issues, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> build nuclear weapons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, the {{incident}} has caused some debates {{because it is}} rare that a Christian black metal band gets signed to a secular label.

Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records {{it was one of those}} things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”.
