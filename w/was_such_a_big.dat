The cellar was indeed filled in, though Kampusch still owns the house.|$|E

500|$|... "Captain Jack" [...] was {{immediately}} embraced by WMMR's audience. For {{the next year}} and a half, the station kept its live version of the song in regular rotation. Listeners called in, wanting to know where they could find the song and on what album it appeared. The song <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit in Philadelphia that several New York radio stations got their own tape copies and began to play it as well. Though Columbia Records' then-president, Clive Davis, first noticed Joel at the Mar y Sol festival in Puerto Rico on Easter Sunday, April 2, 1972, the constant airplay of Joel's unreleased song kept the label's attention. Columbia Records did their best to track Joel down. After turning down a record deal from Atlantic Records, Joel signed with Columbia in the spring of 1973.|$|E
500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|Actor Henry Ian Cusick {{and actress}} Georgina Haig guest {{starred in the}} episode {{as a pair of}} Federal agents. Cusick had worked with co-creator J.J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Pinkner on the ABC series, Lost. Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Brad Dourif, Tim Curry, David Bowie, John Lithgow and James Woods were {{considered}} for the Joker. [...] Lithgow, during his audition, attempted to talk Burton out of casting him, a decision he would later publicly regret, stating, [...] "I didn’t realize it <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal". Burton wanted to cast Brad Dourif, but the studio refused. Robin Williams lobbied hard for the part. Jack Nicholson had been producer Michael Uslan's and Bob Kane's choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson {{as far back as}} 1986, during filming of The Witches of Eastwick. Nicholson had what was known as an [...] "off-the-clock" [...] agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming, as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games. Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days. He received a $6 million salary, as well as {{a large percentage of the}} box office gross estimated between $60 million to $90 million.|$|E
500|$|From {{almost the}} start of his career Barbirolli was a {{frequent}} recording artist. As a young cellist he made four records for Edison Bell in 1911, with piano accompaniment by his sister Rosa, and as part of the Kutcher and the Music Society string quartets he recorded music by Mozart, Purcell, Vaughan Williams and others in 1925 and 1926. As a conductor he began recording in 1927 for the National Gramophonic Society (an offshoot of The Gramophone). Among his records from that period was the first to be made of Elgar's Introduction and Allegro for Strings. On hearing it, the composer said, [...] "I'd never realised it <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> work." [...] Elgar, despite an extensive discography as a conductor, never recorded the work himself, and some have speculated that [...] "the breadth, nobility and lyrical poetry" [...] of Barbirolli's interpretation left the composer disinclined to compete. In 1928 Barbirolli made some recordings for the Edison Bell label. [...] The same year, he began his long association with the His Master's Voice (HMV) label. Immediately after the LSO concert at which he had stood in for Beecham, he was approached by Fred Gaisberg, the chief recording producer for HMV who signed him for his company shortly afterwards. An HMV colleague of Gaisberg described Barbirolli as [...] "a treasure", because he [...] "could accompany Chaliapin without provoking an uproar, win golden opinions from Jascha Heifetz, Artur Rubinstein, Fritz Kreisler and Pablo Casals, and conduct one of the finest recorded performances of the Quintet from Meistersinger".|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Cantrell played {{journalist}} Nona Weisbaum on the mockumentary The Nona Tapes. In 1996, {{he had a}} cameo in Jerry Maguire playing Jesus of CopyMat, the CopyMat {{worker who}} helped Tom Cruise's character make copies of his manifesto. Cantrell said about the film; [...] "I get more people coming up to me telling me my line. It <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> movie {{and it was really}} fun to do." [...] He also had a cameo as a musician in the 2009 film noir comedy Rock Slyde.|$|E

2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me because I like to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of the character. So I knew that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 17, 2016, Wyclef {{released}} his first song in two years, which gave hints {{to a new}} album release. A month later on June 17, he released a new song called Hendrix, and later released a short film featuring Michael K. Williams. He then did many interviews teasing that his new J'ouvert Extended Play would drop in November. Although, this release was pushed back into February. To promote his EP, he did a concert at Terminal 5. On October 14, 2016 Wyclef released an election song called [...] "If I Was President 2016" [...] that would be featured on his J'ouvert EP. On November 1, 2016 he released a song that he had collaborated on with Young Thug. The song was called [...] "I Swear," [...] which is also featured on his EP. Wyclef had also collaborated on Young Thug's Jeffery Mixtape, and was featured on Thug's song [...] "Kanye West." [...] Young Thug also had a song named [...] "Wyclef Jean" [...] that was named after him because he <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> influence.|$|E

60|$|I {{followed}} {{them out to}} where they were standing talking among the gravestones, and sitting down on a tomb near them spoke to the woman. She responded readily enough, apparently pleased to have some one to talk to, and pretty soon began to tell me the history of their lives. She told me that Chilmorton was her native place, but that she had been absent from it many many years. She knew just how many years because her child was only six months old when she left and was now fourteen though she looked more. She <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> girl! Then her man took them to his native place in Staffordshire, where they had lived ever since. But their girl didn't live with them now. An aunt, a sister of her husband, had taken her to the town where she lived, and was having her taught at a private school. As soon as she left school her aunt hoped to get her a place in a draper's shop. For a long time past she had wanted to show her daughter her native place, but {{had never been able to}} manage it because it was so far to come and they didn't have much money to spend; but now at last she had brought her and was showing her everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye mout, considerin' it {{concerns}} some o' your friends," [...] returned Hopkins dryly. [...] "For the Sisters' title went smash {{as soon as}} it was known that Pedro Valdez--the man as started it--had his neck broken outside the walls o' Robles Rancho; and they do say as this yer Brant, YOUR friend, had suthin' to do with the breaking of it, though it was laid to the ghost of old Peyton. Anyhow, there <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> skeer that one of the Greaser gang, who thought he'd seen the ghost, being a Papist, to save his everlasting soul went to the priest and confessed. But the priest wouldn't give him absolution until he'd blown the hull thing, and made it public. And then it turned out that all the dockyments for the title, and even the custom-house paper, were FORGED by Pedro Valdez, and put on the market by his confederates. And that's just where YOUR friend, Clarence Brant, comes in, for HE had bought up the whole title from them fellers. Now, either, as some say, he was in the fraud from the beginnin', and never paid anything, or else he was an all-fired fool, and had parted with his money like one. Some allow that the reason was that he was awfully sweet on Mrs. Peyton's adopted daughter, and ez the parents didn't approve of him, he did THIS so as to get a holt over them by the property. But he's a ruined man, anyway, now; for they say he's such a darned fool that he's goin' to pay for all the improvements that the folks who bought under him put into the land, and that'll take his last cent. I thought I'd tell you that, for I suppose YOU'VE lost a heap in your improvements, and will put in your claim?" ...|$|E
