40|$|When remote users share {{autonomy}} with a telepresence robot, {{questions arise}} {{as to how}} the behaviour of the robot is interpreted by local users. We investigated how a robot's violations of social norms under shared autonomy influence the local user's evaluation of the robot's remote users. Specifically, we examined how attribution of such violations to either the robot or the remote user influences social perception of the remote user. Using personal space invasion as a salient social norm violation, we conducted a within-subject experiment (n= 20) to investigate these questions. Participants saw several people introducing themselves through a telepresence robot, personal space invasion and attribution were manipulated. We found a significant (p= 0. 007) joint effect of the manipulations on interpersonal attraction. After these first 20 participants our robot broke down, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> with another robot (n= 20). We found a difference between the two robots, causing us to discard this data from our main analysis. Subsequent video annotation and comparison of the two robots suggests that accuracy of the followed trajectory modifies attribution. Our results offer insights into the mechanisms of attribution in interactions with a telepresence robot as a mediator...|$|R

Now, {{those of us who}} were active in it at the time, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to keep silent; we may not say what {{motivated}} us at the time, what things looked like in the Weimar Republic. No one wants our contribution to the clarification of what was happening before 1933. They always only wish to listen to the witnesses who were all already [...] "against it" [...] at the time. However, this perforce yields an inaccurate picture and therefore in my view does not contribute to guarding against future dangers. And the new indications are frightening. I don't see the danger in the [...] "neo-Nazis"; I see it with great concern in the growing xenophobia, in the still active demonisation of Communism that goes back to the Nazis, in the popular support for the death penalty, in the opposition to liberalisation of criminal penalties, criminal law and sexuality (legal articles § 218 and § 175). I see a danger in the increasing use of force by [...] "the powers that be" [...] against citizens, in discrimination against the peace movement and limitation of fundamental rights. Because I was active and involved at that time based on my convictions, for that reason I will speak out saying that such a development must not repeat itself.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, Kami Sid, {{a female}} {{identified}} transgender activist, did a photoshoot with photographer Haseeb M. Siddiqui, stylist Waqar J. Khan and makeup artist Nighat Misbah {{as a form}} of protest against the atrocities committed against transgender people in Pakistan. One of those atrocities was the death of a transgender woman identified as Alisha, who had a gunshot wound. Alisha died because there was a delay in care due to an argument whether to put her in the male ward or female ward of the hospital. While Pakistan has addressed a [...] "third" [...] gender when identifying transgender people, Kami Sid believes more can be done. Sid is quoted saying “We have to understand that by just mentioning the third gender identity on your CNIC, the state has not done enough. It is not enough that the government has fixed a two per cent job quota either. No! It’s a protracted fight that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to get equal opportunities” Before doing this photoshoot, Kami Sid was already a part of two documentaries How Gay is Pakistan? and Chuppan Chuppai to shed light on {{what it means to be}} transgender in Pakistan. In January 2017, Sid discussed a new movie she is starring in, Rani, in which she plays a transgender woman who finds an abandoned baby and raises it as her own. The movie is directed by award-winning director Hammad Rizvi. Kami Sid is hopeful that this will have a positive impact on Pakistan's societal view of transgender people, much like the photoshoot. [...] Hina Pathani, another prominent transgender activist, will be starring alongside Kami Sid in Rani. [...] Kami Sid was helpful in confirming and disproving some preconceived notions of transgender people in the recent TV show Khuda Mera Bhi Hai. Asma Nabeel, the writer of Khuda Mera Bhi Hai, was more than happy to ask questions for clarification.|$|E
