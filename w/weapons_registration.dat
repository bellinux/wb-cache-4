50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Sandy Hook Elementary School {{shooting}} and the 2012 Webster, New York shooting, New York became the first U.S. state to enact stricter gun control laws when it passed the NY SAFE Act on January 15, 2013. New measures included the redefining of what is considered an assault <b>weapon,</b> assault <b>weapon</b> <b>registration,</b> prohibition of sales of assault weapons, the prevention of selling or passing on registered assault weapons to friends or family, reducing the maximum allowed magazine capacity from ten rounds to seven rounds, background checks on almost all gun sales including private sales, background checks on all ammunition sales (has yet to go into effect), additional requirements for reporting of persons with mental health issues, and increased penalties for certain gun crimes. The SAFE Act also includes provisions allowing law enforcement to pre-emptively seize a person's firearms without a warrant or court order if they have probable cause that the person in question may be mentally unstable or intends to use the weapons to commit a crime.|$|R

5000|$|The Act {{broadened the}} legal {{definition}} of assault weapon to include those semi-automatic rifles, semi-automatic pistols (handguns), and semi-automatic shotguns {{with one or}} more [...] "military-style features, such as a telescoping stock, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, grenade launcher and others." [...] This [...] "one-feature test" [...] was a change from the previous [...] "two-feature test," [...] enacted in New York in 2000, which barred such weapons if they had two or more of the enumerated features. The bill provided a [...] "grandfathering" [...] provision allowing those with an assault weapon (under the newer, broader definition), to keep the weapon, but required that it be registered with the New York State Police (with a thirteen-month period to register and a deadline of April 15, 2014). There is no fee to register. Alternatively, owners of such <b>weapons</b> could avoid <b>registration</b> by selling the weapon to a New York State dealer or to someone out-of-state by January 15, 2014, or by permanently removing the design characteristics that make the weapon an assault weapon under the Act. Under the Act, the registry of assault weapons is confidential and not subject to public disclosure. The constitutionality of the assault-weapon prohibition was upheld by Chief U.S. District Judge William M. Skretny in 2013, and this ruling was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2015.|$|R
