5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to <b>women</b> <b>because</b> it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to <b>women</b> <b>because</b> it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women to find work outside the home. As Christian Scientists they could become practitioners after just 12 lessons. Of the 14 practitioners listed in the first edition of the Christian Science Journal, 12 were women.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in farming is to {{maintain}} ownership of the main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than <b>women</b> <b>because</b> extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E

5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were <b>women.</b> <b>Because</b> of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E

Dershowitz reportedly received a $75,000 out-of-court settlement, and the newspaper's ombudsman questioned Barnicle's credibility, according to The Boston Phoenix.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Paul the Apostle and Women {{is an important}} element in the theological debate about Christianity and <b>women</b> <b>because</b> Paul was the first writer to give ecclesiastical directives about {{the role of women in}} the Church. However, there are arguments that some of these writings are post-Pauline interpolations.|$|E
25|$|The average {{official}} {{salary in}} 2011 was equivalent to $US2 per month while the actual monthly income {{seems to be}} around $US15 because most North Koreans earn money from illegal small businesses: trade, subsistence farming, and handicrafts. The illegal economy is dominated by <b>women</b> <b>because</b> men have to attend their places of official work {{even though most of}} the factories are non-functioning.|$|E
25|$|Intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews are {{relatively}} {{common in the}} United States and Canada. Several circumstances complicate these unions {{from the perspective of}} the Jewish community. Different movements within Judaism recognize different standards for conversion to Judaism and transmission of their heritage. Social pressure generally falls upon men to marry Jewish <b>women</b> <b>because</b> all movements recognize a Jewish woman's offspring as Jews.|$|E

25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} also posit {{that men}} tend to rise to higher positions than <b>women</b> <b>because</b> of a disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates {{are more likely than}} males to interrupt their careers to raise children. Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.|$|E
25|$|The synagogue was {{originally}} a single-storey building until a second-storey balcony was added. The balcony {{is reserved for}} female {{members of the community}} during the prayer service. Jewish women do not have the duty to learn Hebrew and read the Torah. Because the sacred duty of reading the Torah falls only on the men, the women's section is very simple. The section is also very small because few women attended the service. Jewish law exempts <b>women</b> <b>because</b> of their obligations at home.|$|E
25|$|According to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' {{genotype}} {{would have}} been advantageous for hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing <b>women,</b> <b>because</b> it {{would allow them to}} fatten more quickly during times of abundance. Fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity. However, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. The result of this mismatch between the environment in which the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many aspects}} of the {{internment}} camps caused negative changes within the Japanese-Canadian community, some of these changes had limited positive impacts. For example, many women faced lesser domestic responsibilities within the internment camps. Living spaces were small and crowded so cleaning was shared among multiple woman and took less time than at home. Childcare was also less taxing on <b>women</b> <b>because</b> the cramped quarters allowed for multiple women to care for children at once. In addition, new-found free time allowed younger women to get education and older women to participate in wage-earning jobs, such as workers on beet farms.|$|E
25|$|An anti-Russian uproar {{broke out}} when Russian customs officials, 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Turki Muslim (Uyghur) prostitutes {{to a party}} in January 1902 in Kashgar, this caused a massive brawl by the {{inflamed}} local Turki Muslim populace against the Russians on the pretense of protecting Muslim <b>women</b> <b>because</b> there was anti-Russian sentiment being built up, even though morality was not strict in Kashgar, the local Turki Muslims violently clashed with the Russians before they were dispersed, the Chinese sought to end to tensions to prevent the Russians from building up a pretext to invade.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary theory {{predicts that}} males would be apt to seek more mating {{partners}} than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits {{from such a}} strategy. Accordingly, males developed many behavior strategies {{that allow them to}} acquire more reproductively capable sexual partners. Therefore, in order to monopolize periods of more than one femaleâ€™s reproductive life span without being considered polygamous and thus breaking social norms of a monogamous society, males try to remarry women younger than themselves. A study done in 1994 found a significant difference between ages of remarried men and <b>women</b> <b>because</b> the men have a longer reproductive window.|$|E

25|$|As Patriarch Cyril {{had three}} priorities: the {{recovery}} of the patriarchal finances, the fight against Catholic positions and the instruction of the monks. To improve the finances he raised taxes on the metropolitan bishops and relieved the little parishes: this action was quite successful but made him unpopular among the bishops. He strongly supported the need to re-baptise all converts, and especially <b>women,</b> <b>because</b> he considered the Armenian and Catholic baptisms as not valid. These positions created discontent among the metropolitans, who deposed him in May 1751 and reinstalled the moderate Paisius II in his place. Cyril retired on island of Halki, near Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with lightly {{pigmented}} skin who are repeatedly exposed to strong UV radiation, experience faster {{aging of the}} skin, which shows in increased wrinkling and anomalies of pigmentation. Oxidative damage causes the degradation of protective tissue in the dermis, which confers {{the strength of the}} skin. It has been postulated that white women may develop wrinkles faster after menopause than black <b>women</b> <b>because</b> they are more susceptible to the lifetime damage of the sun through life. Dr. Taylor, of Yale University School of Medicine, concluded that the study could not prove the findings but they suspect the underlying cause. Light-coloured skin has been suspected {{to be one of the}} contributing factors that promote wrinkling.|$|E
25|$|They {{worked at}} the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps {{beginning}} in 1942. The following year, the Nazis began the conscription of <b>women</b> <b>because</b> of the shortage of guards. Later, during the war, women were also assigned {{on a smaller scale}} in the camps Neuengamme Auschwitz (I, II and III), Plaszow FlossenbÃ¼rg, Gross-Rosen Vught and Stutthof, but never served in the death camps of BeÅ‚Å¼ec, SobibÃ³r Treblinka or CheÅ‚mno. Seven Aufseherinnen served at Vught, 24 were at Buchenwald, 34 at Bergen-Belsen, 19 at Dachau, 20 at Mauthausen, three at Mittelbau-Dora, seven at Natzweiler-Struthof, twenty at Majdanek, 200 at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, 140 at Sachsenhausen, 158 at Neuengamme, 47 at Stutthof, compared with 958 who served at RavensbrÃ¼ck, 561 at FlossenbÃ¼rg and 541 at Gross-Rosen. Many supervisors worked in the sub-camps in Germany, some in France, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland.|$|E
