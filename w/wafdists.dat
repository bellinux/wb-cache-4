50|$|From 1924 until {{independence}} in 1956, the British had {{a policy of}} running Sudan as two essentially separate territories, the north and south.

The <b>Wafdist</b> parliamentary majority had rejected Sarwat Pasha's accommodation plan with Austen Chamberlain in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The Sudan Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at £6.6 million, thereafter the <b>Wafdist</b> disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression.

25|$|Encouragement {{came from}} many directions. In 1919, the League of Nations was founded. Here many nations lobbied for sovereignty, {{including}} the <b>Wafdist</b> tafwid (delegation) of Egypt. Turkey under Ataturk rejected the Verssailes borders and fought successfully {{to establish their}} national independence on their own terms. The Bolshevik revolution in Russia had resulted in a new state power which angrily confronted the international order, and began to organized and fund subversive groups in order to overthrow existing regimes.

50|$|The {{events were}} {{seen at the}} time as {{evidence}} of the Egyptian government's inability to maintain order.

Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas initially presented his resignation, which was refused by King Farouk I. The <b>Wafdist</b> government of el-Nahhas and the king blamed each other for the failure to call in troops earlier. The Council of Ministers imposed martial law throughout the country, and ordered the closure of schools and universities. El-Nahhas was appointed military commander-in-chief, and proclaimed a curfew in Cairo and Giza from 6 pm to 6 am. He also issued an order banning public gatherings of five or more persons, with offenders facing imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, news of {{the attack}} in Ismaïlia reached Cairo, provoking the ire of Egyptians.

Protesters then headed towards the university building, where they were joined by students. Together they marched towards the prime minister's office to demand that Egypt break its diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and declare war on it. Abdul Fattah Hassan, the Minister of Social Affairs, told them that the <b>Wafdist</b> government wished to do so, but faced opposition from King Farouk I.

The Cairo Fire pushed the Free Officers to advance the date of their planned coup, which took place on 23 July 1952. The coup resulted in the forced abdication of Farouk I and the abolition of the monarchy a year later. It also reignited anti-British hostilities, which led to the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Evacuation Agreement in 1954.

5000|$|The title {{had long}} been used by Egyptian nationalists to {{emphasize}} their desire for {{the unity of the}} Nile Valley.

50|$|In 1951, Egypt's <b>Wafdist</b> government, led by Prime Minister Nahhas Pasha, {{decided to}} {{unilaterally}} abrogate the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, a move which the United Kingdom deemed illegal {{and refused to}} recognize. As a result, confrontation erupted in the Suez Canal zone between Egypt's police and fedayeen on the one hand, and British military forces on the other hand. As a sign of protest, the Egyptian Council of Ministers decided to recall Amr from London on 11 December 1951. Amr was appointed on 25 December as the king's special advisor for foreign affairs, while keeping his original post of ambassador. After {{the outbreak of the}} devastating Cairo Fire of 26 January 1952—which remains unexplained to this day—, there were numerous conspiracy theories regarding the identity of the perpetrators. Some such as newspaper Al-Masri defended the idea that the fire was started by King Farouk, and accused Amr Pasha and the British Embassy of being part of the plot. According to this view, the appointment of Amr as the king's special advisor only a month prior to the fire's breakout, as well as the selection of Hafez Pasha Afifi, another pro-British official, as chief of the royal cabinet, were measures aimed at undermining the nationalist Wafd government. Supporters of this conspiracy theory allege that Amr and Afifi served as intermediaries between the King and the British in their joint planning of the fire.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 45). Egypt achieved independence from Britain {{as a result of the}} Egyptian Revolution (1919 - 1923). During this revolution, the Egyptian nationalist movement was formally established by the Wafd party, a congress type of political organization that traditionally has received the credit for the success of the Egyptian nationalistic cause. However, at the end of 1921 the leaders of the male leaders of the Wafd were exiled by the British government, leaving the <b>Wafdist</b> Women's Central Committee (WWCC) headed by Huda Sharawi in command of the battle for Independence. This organization became a powerful, organized group involved in economic boycotts, public demonstrations, and the supplying of information to Wafd exiles. These women also kept up morale, passed political resolutions, served as liaisons between the British officials and the exiles, and maintained a stream of political protests until March 1923. This study argues that by using the very spaces to which they were confined, the harem and religious places of worship, the women of the WWCC greatly contributed to the success of Egyptian nationalist activity. Using archival data and interviews, my paper uncovers the accomplishments of these seldom recognized, revolutionary women who mobilized the Egyptian nationalist cause against Western domination in the absence of the established male leadership and who then were forgotten quickly by the very government they helped to found. I conclude that the traditional view that the Wafd was responsible for the success of nationalist activity during the fight for Egyptian independence is inadequate for it overlooks the tremendous contributions of the WWCC and Egyptian women...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines Lawrence Durrell’s The Alexandria Quartet in {{its various}} Egyptian contexts. It contests {{the idea that the}} Alexandria of the Quartet is essentially a city of the imagination which bears little or no relation to the real city of history. It argues that various strata of Alexandrian history, from antiquity to the nineteen- fifties, are deeply embedded in Durrell’s Quartet. Of particular interest is the tetralogy’s representation of the history of Egypt’s <b>Wafdist</b> independence movement in the years 1919 - 1952, and Britain’s responses to it. The dissertation argues that the tetralogy can be read as an allegorical treatment of historical events that took place in colonial Egypt. Chapter One of the dissertation provides an over-view of Durrell’s Quartet and of the main critical and scholarly approaches which have been used {{in the study of the}} tetralogy, Chapter Two continues the exposition, with particular reference to T. S. Eliot’s concept of “tradition”, and Edward Said’s “Orientalism” as keys for the understanding of the Quartet. This chapter then applies these two concepts to the analysis of the Quartet, and proposes a “tradition of Orientalism” with the tetralogy as the paradigmal text of “late Orientalism”. Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is proposed as an important precussor. Chapter Three examines the ways in which the Quartet makes use of the history of Alexandria from the city’s founding by the Ptolomies until early modern times, with particular reference to the British occupation of Egypt 1882 - 1956. The chapter then examines the tetralogy’s treatment of British Imperial selfhood and the Egyptian “Other”. Chapter Four examines the Alexandria Quartet, in particular Mountolive, in parallel to the history of the Egyptian Wafd party and the struggle for Egyptian independence. It argues that Mountolive should be read as an allegorical treatment of events that took place in Egypt between the years 1919 - 56. Chapter five investigates the relationship between the Alexandria Quartet and the three phases of Durrell’s “Egyptian” poetry: that written between 1938 - 40, which utilises themes from ancient Egyptian mythology; that written during Durrell’s Egyptian exile between 1941 - 45; and that written in the immediate post-war period 1945 - 50. In this way the historical context brought up to the early nineteen-fifties. Chapter Six concludes the dissertation by asserting the importance of the Alexandria Quartet as a key literary text from a period that saw the end of Empire and the beginnings of de-colonisation, and argues that the tetralogy should be given an enhanced status in the study of colonial and post-colonial English writin...|$|R
