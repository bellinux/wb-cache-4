5|$|In a later {{period the}} Serapeum in Alexandria was also {{said to have}} {{contained}} a solar alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> across the lips {{of the statue of}} Serapis thus symbolising the Sun saluting the god.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} {{suggested that}} the cyclone <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, Daniel's remnants dissipated southeast of Hawaii. The storm brought light to moderate precipitation to the islands of Hawaii and Maui, causing minor flooding, although no major damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, it was {{reported}} that a high school classmate of Donaghy's, and the classmate's boss, had bet on NBA games based on Donaghy's tips. Donaghy later revealed that he was rewarded $2,000 cash for each correct pick based on the tips he <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> along.|$|E

5|$|Early {{tropical}} cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> close to Guam, prompting officials to undergo {{preparations for the}} storm. The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan, causing damage along the island's northern portion. Mireille knocked over trees and damaged over 70% of Saipan's crops while also eroding coastal roads.|$|E
5|$|He {{would bet}} on anything—perhaps {{he was the}} {{original}} of the saying about flies crawling up the window. Waiting on a railway line he would bet on how many trains <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> through the opposite platform. how may carriages {{would be on the}} next one, how many carriage windows would be open. In a train he would produce a brass top stamped Put and Take—he paid or collected according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex of the}} {{different}} size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs <b>would</b> <b>pass.</b> He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.|$|E

5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared {{to pose a}} threat to Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a school to be used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.|$|E
5|$|According to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the {{magazine}} predicted that by 2010, Woods <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> one {{billion dollars in}} earnings. In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars (before taxes) in his career, after accounting for the $10million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title. The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600million, making him the second richest person {{of color in the}} United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey. In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

5|$|As {{the highway}} <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> through the Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E

Two weeks <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> before American officials learnt of the contents of the Quebec Agreement. Over the next two years, the Combined Policy Committee met only eight times.|$|E

5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the road}} from Marcellus to Camillus along the Nine Mile Creek route was {{improved}} by the Camillus and Marcellus Plank Road Company, which was first chartered in 1853 and authorized to collect tolls from travelers using the road. The improvement of the road led to it becoming a stagecoach route {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. The former plank road alignment in the village of Marcellus (North Street) and the southward continuation along Cherry Street (now South Street) was paved in 1911 as part of the construction of a new state highway that <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> through the town.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{the names}} of 19 eze Nri were recorded, but the list is not easily {{converted}} into chronological terms because of long interregnums between installations. Tradition held that at least seven years <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> upon {{the death of the}} eze Nri before a successor could be determined; the interregnum served as a period of divination of signs from the deceased eze Nri, who would communicate his choice of successor from beyond the grave in the seven or more years ensuing upon his death.|$|E

None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|Journey {{times from}} Knowle West {{to the city}} centre have been {{identified}} as hampering employment opportunities for residents and proposals for a Greater Bristol Bus Network and a rapid transit scheme have noted the need to provide better connectivity for the area. A journey from Filwood Park to the city centre takes around 50 minutes and from Inns Court to Broadmead takes over 30 minutes. Proposed extensions to the A4174 ring road, which <b>would</b> <b>pass</b> along the southern part of Knowle West, have been claimed to reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use. The plans were approved by the Department for Transport in December 2011.|$|E
