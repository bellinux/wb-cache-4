40|$|The <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> {{dependency}} of the nondimensional {{sea surface}} roughness (also called the Charnock parameter) is investigated {{with data from}} the new field measurement program at Rødsand in the Danish Baltic Sea. An increasing Charnock parameter with inverse <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> is found, which can be described by a power-law relation. Friction velocity is a common quantity in both the Charnock parameter and <b>wave</b> <b>age.</b> Thus self-correlation effects are unavoidable in the relation between them. The significance of self-correlation is investigated by employing an artificial “dataset” with randomized wave parameters. It is found that self-correlation severely influences the relation. For the Rødsand dataset the difference between real and randomized “data” {{was found to be}} within the measurement uncertainty. By using a small subset of the data {{it was found that the}} importance of self-correlation increases for a narrower range of <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> values. This supports the conclusion of Johnson et al. that because of the scatter and self-correlation problems the coefficients of the power-law relation can only be obtained from the analysis of an aggregated dataset with a wide <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> range combining measurements from several sites. The dependency between <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> and sea roughness has been discussed extensively in the literature with different and sometimes conflicting results. A wide range of coefficients has been found for the power-law relation between the Charnock parameter and <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> for different datasets. It is shown that self-correlation contributes to such differences, since it depends on the range of <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> values present in the datasets. Also, data are often selected for rough flow conditions with the Reynolds roughness number. It is shown that for datasets with large scatter this can lead to misleading results with regard to the relationship between <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> and Charnock parameter.

40|$|A simple coupled flux and {{sea state}} model is developed. It is {{applicable}} to low, moderate, and high wind speeds, with a nonarbitrary <b>wave</b> <b>age.</b> It is fully consistent with an atmospheric flux parameterization. The flux model includes {{the influence of}} capillary waves on surface stress, which dominate surface stress on a wave-perturbed surface for U 10, 7 m s 21. The coupled model is verified for conditions of local equilibrium and {{it is used to}} examine the influences of surface tension and capillary waves on the equilibrium sea state at low and moderate wind speeds (U 10, 7 m s 21). Capillary waves can directly influence characteristics of the airflow (roughness length and friction velocity), and surface tension can directly influence wave characteristics (period, phase speed, and <b>wave</b> <b>age).</b> The influences of capillary waves and surface tension on wave characteristics are found to be noticeable for U 10, 6 m s 21, and are likely to be significant in most applications when U 10, 5 m s 21.

The new sea state parameterization is an improvement over previous relations (which apply well for U 10. 7 m s 21) because it is also applicable for low and moderate winds. The mean wind speed over most of the world’s oceans is less than 7 m s 21, so there is considerable need for such a parameterization.

40|$|By using {{ten years}} of {{collocated}} Precipitation Radar and buoy data, the relationships between Ku-band normalized radar cross section (sigma(o)) and integrated wind and wave parameters (e. g., significant wave height, wave period, wave steepness, and <b>wave</b> <b>age)</b> at low incidence angles are analyzed for different sea states using correlation and dependence analysis. The {{results show that the}} relationships are significantly different for different sea states. Second, the potential for inverting these parameters directly from a single sigma(o) is investigated. The results reveal that the retrieval of wind speed above 10 m (U- 10) is most suitable for a nonpure-swell sea and that the performance of significant wave height (H-s) retrieval decreases with the ratio of swell to wind waves. For wave period and wavelength, a feasible inversion can only be performed for a wind-wave-dominated sea. Wave steepness (delta(a)) is strongly correlated with sigma(o) in all sea states and can even be higher than that for U- 10 in pure-swell seas. It is suggested from the present data set that real <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> (beta) may be retrieved from a swell-dominated sea and, therefore, has a low-value cutoff. Furthermore, the extent to which U- 10 retrieval depends on sea state is examined by calculating the correlation coefficient between sigma(o) residuals and various standard wave parameters and, then, by determining the partial correlation coefficient between sigma(o) and each wave parameter controlled by U- 10. Both results indicate that wind direction is better taken into account above 13. 5 degrees. Moreover, an auxiliary parameter related to wave slope, such as wave steepness, would help to improve retrieval performance. Significant wave height data are of secondary use, but an implementation with real <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> information might not significantly improve wind speed retrieval. To improve the performance of H-s and wave period retrieval, auxiliary information, such as wind speed, wave steepness, or <b>wave</b> <b>age,</b> is needed.

40|$|Generally, ocean {{waves are}} thought {{to act as a}} drag on the surface wind so that {{momentum}} is transferred downward, from the atmosphere into the waves. Recent observations have suggested that when long wave-length waves—which are characteristic of remotely generated swell—propagate faster than the surface wind, momentum can also be transferred upward. This upward momentum transfer acts to accelerate the near-surface wind, resulting in a low-level wave-driven wind jet. Previous studies have suggested that the sign reversal of themomentumflux is well predicted by the inverse <b>wave</b> <b>age,</b> the ratio of the surface wind speed to the speed of thewaves {{at the peak of the}} spectrum. Data from the 40 -yr ECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA- 40) have been used here to calculate the global distribution of the inverse <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> to determine whether there are regions of the ocean that are usually in the wind-drivenwave regime and others that are generally in the wave-drivenwind regime. The wind-driven wave regime is found to occurmost often in themidlatitude storm tracks where wind speeds are generally high. The wave-driven wind regime is found to be prevalent in the tropics where wind speeds are generally light and swell can propagate from storms at higher latitudes. The inverse <b>wave</b> <b>age</b> is also a useful indicator of the degree of coupling between the local wind and wave fields.

40|$|Abstract. The {{occurrence}} of extreme waves in deep sea waters, and their breaking, is examined {{with the aid}} of a pdf model of joint amplitudes and frequencies. New wave breaking considerations allow kinematic, dynamic and maximum average slope concepts to be unified in a single breaking criterion that allows the more accurate determination of the limiting amplitudes that extreme waves can reach, incorporating the influence of non-linearity of the wave field and the premature wave breaking concept. The probability of extreme wave occur-rence does not significantly depend on the sea spectrum bandwidth. The breaking probability of extreme waves increases with the inverse <b>wave</b> <b>age,</b> but its dependence on the latter parameter weakens, as the limiting crest height criterion is stiffened.
