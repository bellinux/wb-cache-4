5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round. A 3–6 defeat by Stephen Hendry in the quarter-finals of the Masters was {{followed}} by his second ranking title, when he defeated Ryan Day 9–4 in {{the final of the}} Malta Cup. After the victory, he said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> get rid of the one-hit wonder label. In his next match, a victory over Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open, he scored centuries in four consecutive frames, becoming only the second player to do this (after Higgins in the 2005 Grand Prix final) and the only person to do so in a best-of-nine match. He went on to lose 3–5 to Maguire in the quarter-finals. In the World Championship, Murphy defeated Stevens 13–12 in the quarter-finals—recovering from 5–11 down and knocking the latter out of the top 16—before losing 16–17 against Mark Selby in the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|In a {{cosmology}} {{dominated by}} Hydrogen and Helium, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> find {{a source of}} the material that forms the terrestrial planets.|$|E
25|$|Following {{transmission}} of episode one, {{the story was}} discussed by BBC1 controller Paul Fox and Richard Levin, head of television design, who both commended {{the quality of the}} script and production. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Barry Letts, who due to the extra location filming, had gone over budget on the serial.|$|E
60|$|He {{understood}} her feeling and soothed her and diverted her, though tears would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R

60|$|I will quote but {{one more}} paragraph, which, {{by reason of}} its monstrous absurdity, may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> these atrocious deeds.|$|R
25|$|As a Queen Dowager, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Sophia Magdalena to {{withdraw}} from public life. Her brother-in-law, Duke Charles, became regent, and she eschewed a political role. As a widow, Sophia Magdalena lived a withdrawn life. She {{did not wish to}} take part in any representational duties, and she gave up her quarters at Drottningholm Palace to be relieved of them. She lived in the Royal Palace in Stockholm during the winter, and at Ulriksdal Palace during the summer. She lived in a circle of her own court, and seldom entertained any guests other than her lifelong friends Maria Aurora Uggla and Virginia Manderström. It is noted, that although she had hated the male favorites of her spouse during his lifetime, she gave several of them a position in her court as a widow. Sophia Magdalena had a close relationship with her son, King Gustav IV Adolf, who visited her regularly and with whom she shared an interest in religion.|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, Seyfried {{was cast}} as Anita [...] "Needy" [...] Lesnicki, the [...] "plain Jane" [...] best friend to Fox's {{character}} {{with whom she}} shares a somewhat lesbian infatuation. Seyfried said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> play the nerdy character opposite Fox. [...] "Being a lead (like Megan), you have that weird pressure of feeling {{like you have to}} look attractive," [...] she stated. [...] "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [...] I don't want to play the one that everybody is supposed to want to have sex with." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast {{changes were}} met with mixed reviews. Mike Hale felt that the {{departure}} of Christopher Meloni <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> the show, as his [...] "tightly wound" [...] character had a [...] "wack-a-doodle intensity [...] had taken 'SVU' way off track", but still {{found it hard to}} imagine the show without him. He said that Meloni's absence turned the episode [...] "into the best showcase his partner, Olivia, had been given in years." [...] He called the addition of Michael Cutter was [...] "a big gain" [...] for the show, but felt uncertain about the addition of Detective Rollins, writing: [...] "A scene in which she tried to sweet-talk information out of a jailed suspect was the one really weak moment in the episode." [...] TVfanatic.com also had mixed feeling about Detective Rollins, who is [...] supposed to breathe new life into the series, but wrote that Rollins may end up becoming an interesting character.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sha'n't have 'em! go away. Why don't you get 'em of Clytemnerestera?" [...] (It seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Mliss {{to express}} her {{contempt}} in additional syllables to that classical young woman's already long-drawn title.) [...] "O you wicked thing!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{often used}} to see her there, and when a chance {{occurred}} she would talk to me. It seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> her to use her own tongue, but it made me nervous at times for fear someone would hear her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shan't have 'em! go away! Why don't you get 'em of Clytemnerestera?" [...] It seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> M'liss {{to express}} her {{contempt}} in additional syllables to that classical young woman's already long- drawn title. [...] "Oh, you wicked thing!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was amazed}} at my own calmness. My {{interview}} with Major Fitz-David had, perhaps, exhausted my capacity for feeling any strong emotion, for the time at least. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me to be alone; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me to begin the search. Those were my only sensations so far.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Gerald that he could, at least, answer this.|$|E
60|$|A LITTLE {{interval}} of solitude <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me, {{as well as}} to Miserrimus Dexter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, well, {{that must}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> you, I <b>am</b> sure, Mr Perceval. These poachers <b>are</b> <b>a</b> terrible nuisance. They do frighten the birds so.' ...|$|R
60|$|A flush {{crept into}} Agatha's face. Though his {{acquiescence}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> her, {{she felt that}} he might have made a more vigorous protest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! When you {{are married}} to Miss Blake, {{you can pay}} me back, if it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> you. When's the wedding to be?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Anthea, Forster came in, {{and dropped}} into a chair.|$|E
60|$|She looked swiftly around, and I fancied that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> {{her to find}} me alone.|$|E
60|$|Ferdinand could {{scarcely}} refrain from a smile. Even the conversation {{of the little}} waiter <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hastings smiled again. [...] "Well," [...] she commented, [...] "I {{would like}} to think you were right about Harry; it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{no need of}} keepin' him trussed up any longer, an' I reckon it'll <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> {{chance to}} use his tongue once more." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{companion}} smiled again. [...] "Well," [...] {{she said}} drily, [...] "I {{would like to}} think you were right about Harry; it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> hear Peg speak well of somebody; {{but that}} was the only {{exception}} she made.|$|E
60|$|Seeing that {{objections}} {{would be}} useless, Leonard reluctantly acquiesced, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> both when Wannop came in.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> {{be in that}} cool, twilight, not unbeautiful {{interior}} {{after my}} day in the burning sun.|$|E
60|$|A flush {{crept into}} Agatha's face. Though his {{acquiescence}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> her, {{she felt that}} after all he {{might have made a}} more vigorous protest.|$|R
60|$|His {{face grew}} hard {{and for a}} moment he set his lips tight. It would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> express his {{feelings}} concerning his host just then.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been at some {{funerals}} {{where it}} would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> laugh, and I've wanted to cry at some weddings. But you think it wouldn't do?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was flung at Kinnaird, but Ida {{saw that it}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> him when she answered it.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> me when Dick came on deck. Even an incredulous confidant {{is better}} than none at all.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> Randal--in {{the present}} state of Catherine's {{relations}} toward Bennydeck--to return to London without having seen his friend.|$|E
6000|$|Vane stopped him. [...] "When you {{are married}} to Miss Blake {{you can pay}} me back, if it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> you. When's the wedding to be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything {{is better}} than {{standing}} here. I don't think the cliff goes quite sheer down everywhere. Let us try, Dick; it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} do so," [...] the lawyer said, firmly. [...] "It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> <b>to</b> {{me to know}} that I have at least made a full confession." ...|$|R
