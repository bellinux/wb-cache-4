Sex toys may be used as assistive devices as well; for example, vibrators can be used to provide extra stimulation and in circumstances where hand mobility is impaired. Other supportive devices include manual stimulation pumps, for erection promotion and maintenance, and [...] "sex furniture", whereby rail or clamp enhancements, or specialised designs facilitate sexual activity.|$|R
50|$|Naloxone is most {{commonly}} injected intravenously for fastest action, which usually causes {{the drug to}} act within a minute, and lasts up to 45 minutes. It can also be administered via intramuscular, subcutaneous injection, or nasal spray. There is a pre packaged nasal spray that does not require assembly and delivers a consistent dose. It can be repeated if necessary. A non-FDA approved <b>wedge</b> <b>device</b> (nasal atomizer) attached to a syringe {{may be used to}} create a mist that delivers the drug to the nasal mucosa. It is more common outside of facilities where the majority of overdoses occur.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of current and future algorithms for signature and encryption in the EMV standards in the case where a single key-pair is used for both signature and encryption. We give a theoretical attack for EMV’s current RSA-based algorithms, showing how access to a partial decryption oracle {{can be used to}} forge a signature on a freely chosen message. We show how the attack might be integrated into EMV’s CDA protocol flow, enabling an attacker with a <b>wedge</b> <b>device</b> to complete an offline transaction without knowing the cardholder’s PIN. Finally, the elliptic curve signature and encryption algorithms that are likely to be adopted in a forthcoming version of the EMV standards are analyzed in the single key-pair setting, and shown to be secure...|$|R
40|$|The slide <b>wedge</b> <b>device</b> has {{at least}} one pair if opposingly movable slide wedge {{components}} (14), which by means of tension devices (16) are tensioned radially inwards, locating on the base plate (20) and the wedge pressure plate (12). The tension on the slide wedge components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The wedge pressure plate may have one or more wedge surfaces with a wedge angle corresponding to that of the slide wedge components. The wedge pressure plate can be axially slidably movably accommodated in a housing (18) with an axial end stop for it. ADVANTAGE - With technically simple means, a secure press power transmission is made possible and the arrangement also offers a rapidly and easily releasable overload protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the denting response of pipes subjected to lateral (transverse) quasistatic wedge loading, {{in the presence}} of internal pressure. Pipes are modeled with nonlinear shell finite elements and a simplified analytical model. The analysis focuses on the significant influence of internal pressure on the denting resistance. Furthermore, the effects of <b>wedge</b> denting <b>device</b> orientation on the denting resistance are briefly discussed. Motivated by the experimental and numerical results, a two-dimensional heuristic model is proposed, which yields closed-form expressions for the denting force in terms of the corresponding displacement. The finite element results and the model equations are in good agreement with the experimental results and illustrate pipe denting response in an elegant manne...|$|R

Cable connecting devices connect winding installation cables to extraction vessels. Depending on their design, connecting cables can be: with loop and core, self-tightening with wedged core on one or both sides; with hinged jaw; with cone-shaped friction wedges; with wedges and bridles. The paper presents an analysis of circular self-tightening metal cable connecting <b>devices</b> <b>wedged</b> on both sides, meeting the requirements of STAS 12519 / 87...|$|R
50|$|The quartz-silica wedge {{depolarizer}} is {{a common}} commercial design and {{is similar to the}} Cornu depolarizer, however, the angle between the two components is much smaller (2° is typical) and only the first component is birefringent. The second component is made of fused silica, which has a very similar refractive index to quartz, but is not birefringent. The fast axis of the quartz element is generally at 45° to the <b>wedge.</b> The whole <b>device</b> is much more compact than a Cornu depolarizer (for the same aperture).|$|R
50|$|In rail terminology, a fishplate, {{splice bar}} or joint bar is a metal bar that is {{bolted to the}} ends of two rails to join them {{together}} in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship's mast. The top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the <b>device</b> <b>wedges</b> itself between {{the top and bottom of}} the rail when it is bolted into place. In rail transport modelling, a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.|$|R

Taken the <b>wedge</b> adjustment bending <b>device</b> on a 11 -roll cold leveler in a cross cut line as research object, in order to studying its bending characteristic, three-dimensional assembly model contained roll system, roller bending frame and upper beam has been built based on the finite element method. With the model, the necessity and function of the bending device has been verified. Different plate width, leveling force and roll bending value effects on working roll gap curve have been discussed. The result could serve as theoretical base for online set model and provide more precise parameters, accordingly maximize the potential ability of levelers...|$|R
40|$|Artificial tissue {{expansion}} {{is required to}} generate new skin prior to reconstructive surgery, in order to compensate for a deficit of healthy tissue. Hydrogel tissue expanders, which expand anisotropically, show great promise in overcoming clinical limitations in the field, thus allowing the technique {{to be used in}} a wider range of surgeries. These devices consist of pellets of dry poly(methyl methacrylate-co-vinylpyrrolidone), compressed into discs through a hot compression moulding process. However, a number of significant problems still exist in these devices, and this thesis aims to address these issues. To date, there has been a lack of investigation of the factors governing the behaviour of anisotropic swelling. For this reason, a range of different compression ratios have been investigated, with particular focus on the relationship between the material flow during compression and the swelling behaviour of the resulting device. It was found that samples of the same initial size expand to the same reference swelling dimensions, regardless of compression ratio. During hot pressing, the material flow was found to be governed by slip-stick behaviour at the interface between the hot press and the device, affecting the properties and swelling behaviour of the devices. Based on these findings, devices were developed which could expand from a disc into a non-prismatic shape (dome or <b>wedge).</b> Such <b>devices</b> could reduce complication rates and allow the growth of new tissue with anisotropic resting tension. The devices were tested in a small in vivo trial, where it was shown that there were no adverse effects on the tissue produced, and that the shape of the expander (dome) was retained. As devices are being produced for medical use, understanding the effect of sterilization by γ-irradiation is essential, but to date this has been overlooked in the literature. It was found that γ-irradiation caused an increase in cross-linking in the P(MMA-co-NVP). Whilst this produced little change in swelling behaviour for isotropic devices, in the case of anisotropic devices it caused a change in the shape of expansion, reducing the area of new skin which could be generated by the device. It was found that by reducing the concentration of impurities (residual molecules from the polymer synthesis) the impact of γ-irradiation could be greatly reduced. Finally, controlling the rate of {{expansion is}} essential in order to avoid clinical complications. In order to control the rate of expansion, particularly during the initial period of swelling, semi-permeable PDMS coatings were applied to the compressed devices. Coatings of thickness greater than 0. 375 mm were found to effectively control the rate of swelling, for both cylindrical and non-prismatic shapes. As the coating thickness increased, the maximum swelling size decreased. However, {{it has been shown that}} change in height (the parameter which governs the area of skin produced) is affected less than the change in mass or diameter.
