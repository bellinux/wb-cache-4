5|$|By 1982, Sims {{was part}} of a promotional tour {{reviving}} interest in No Maps on My Taps with co-stars Bunny Briggs and Chuck Green, their pre-screening performances backed by Cab Calloway. Even as booked performances <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> more regularly, Sims never stopped participating in street-corner challenges, encouraging younger generations of dancers and inviting them to learn his moves.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine. Her drug use resulted in delusions and caused her to become schizophrenic, and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to take away her drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{their opening}} {{game of the}} 1920 season, the Tigers played the Dayton Triangles. The Triangles <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> off a {{historic}} game; {{it was the first}} match between two APFA teams. No team scored in this game, and it ended in a 0–0 tie.|$|E

5|$|Stoneman and Burbridge {{continued}} on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men. Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped {{just so they}} could fire a volley into the Union cavalry. They then continued to retreat toward Marion. Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to join them at Marion.|$|E
5|$|This {{game was}} Bob Stoops's 100th {{as head coach}} at Oklahoma; {{it was also the}} 25th meeting between the programs. The Sooners held a narrow 14–10 lead in the series going into the game, though A had won five of the eight played in College Station. Both the Sooners and the Aggies <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> off a four-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|Tigers' {{next game}} was played against the Canton Bulldogs, who <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> off their first loss of the season. Neither team scored in the first quarter, but the Bulldogs ran for two touchdowns in the second. Calac and Grigg had 6- and 15-yard rushing touchdowns. The Bulldogs' defense forced two safeties—one {{in the third and}} one in the fourth quarter—to win the game 18–0.|$|E

5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes <b>were</b> <b>coming.</b> In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but {{he chose not to}} wait for the Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Noel Park {{development}} and the growing nearby community of Wood Green <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to dominate the area. In recognition of this, in 1902 Green Lanes railway station was renamed Noel Park & Wood Green. In 1911 a group of mid-Victorian houses on Wood Green High Road, immediately south of the railway station, were demolished by the Artizans Company {{to make way for}} the Cheapside shopping parade, built to serve residents of Noel Park and the growing community of Wood Green.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction of the shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E

5|$|I {{remember}} {{when they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle of}} the chaos. It had been booked in, that they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{hospitality}} sector received a major boost {{due to the}} games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record number of visitors.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> {{to an end and}} relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E

5000|$|Nationalism is {{the main}} process through which the {{government}} is able to shape public opinion. Propaganda in the media is strategically placed {{in order to promote}} a common attitude among the people. Louis A. Perez Jr. provides an example of propaganda used during the war of 1898, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>coming,</b> Cuba, coming; we are bound to set you free! We <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> from the mountains, from the plains and inland sea! We <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> with the wrath of God to make the Spaniards flee!

5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids <b>were</b> <b>coming,</b> allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did not know that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers <b>were</b> <b>coming,</b> and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E

5|$|The {{outlook for}} the {{upcoming}} 1915 Vanderbilt football season was not promising. The Commodores <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> off a losing record of 2–8, the first under head coach Dan McGugin, and the second in the school's 25 years of playing football. Additionally, only 10 experienced players {{from the previous year}} were returning to the team. Despite the one-platoon system with players featuring on offense, defense, and special teams used in 1915, this meant inexperienced freshmen would be a key to the team's success.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could {{not fall into}} enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to be}} used over land. It proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers against ground targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a multi-storey building. Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
