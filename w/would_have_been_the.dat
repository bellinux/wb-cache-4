5|$|As {{reported}} by Kamilla Trever in 1950, {{according to a}} different interpretation of the extant literary testimonia and the evidence provided by coinage, the erection of the temple started in 115 AD. The pretext for its construction <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> declaration of Armenia as a Roman province and the temple would have housed the imperial effigy of Trajan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes. The Navy had five larger, more modern submarines (what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> U-7 class) under construction in Germany at the outbreak of war, but when the Navy became convinced that delivery of the U-7 boats would be impossible, they were sold to Germany in November 1914.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of the {{principal}} staircase an Anteroom divides the former Great Chamber from what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> main bedroom. During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as a bedroom by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the few in the house.|$|E

5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport {{following the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Djibouti {{failed to}} collect an Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> country's first since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where Hussein Ahmed Salah won the bronze in the men's marathon. Ayanleh Souleiman almost ended the nation's 28-year drought on the podium, but he {{slipped out of}} medals to fourth in the men's 1500 metres.|$|E
5|$|Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century. The sheep that colonists {{would have}} been using at the time <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{contemporary}} English breeds, but Merinos were known to roam the barrier islands, taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose. The colonists would have used some combination of these sheep in their flocks.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen hundred jobs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{created during}} <b>the</b> station's construction, {{and more than}} 200 {{full-time}} jobs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> available once <b>the</b> station <b>was</b> operating.|$|R
50|$|The spoken {{language}} of Genova and the Ligurian coast <b>would</b> primarily <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Ligurian language. <b>The</b> Italian language <b>was</b> originally {{based on the}} fourteenth century vernacular of Florence in the adjacent region of Tuscany, and <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> main {{spoken language}} of Genova in the fifteenth century.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{built the}} Wright R-1820 under license during World War II, Studebaker also {{attempted}} to build what <b>would</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest aircraft piston engine ever built.

5|$|Hutchinson's husband William died {{some time}} after June 1641 {{at the age of}} 55, the same age at which Anne's father had died. He was buried in Portsmouth. No record of his death exists because there was no {{established}} church, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> customary repository for such records.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the 2014 Sochi Games, Badenhorst competed {{and trained}} in the Netherlands, Austria, and the United States. By February 2014, she was ranked eighth in the world. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first female snowboarder to {{represent}} Australia at the Winter Paralympics at Sochi, but was forced to withdraw from her event after suffering an injury to her left knee whilst training {{on the morning of}} the event.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} and so far only time that the steeplechase was {{declared}} void, after 30 of the 39 runners began and carried on racing despite there having been a false start. Seven of the field even went on to complete the course, with Esha Ness crossing the finishing post first, in what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> second-fastest time ever.|$|E
50|$|Had the {{suspensions}} of Vilma and Hargrove <b>been</b> upheld, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> longest for an on-field {{incident in}} modern NFL history, topping {{the previous record}} set in 2006, when then-Titans defensive end Albert Haynesworth was given a five-game suspension for stomping {{on the head of}} Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Andre Gurode.|$|R

5|$|Louisiana {{was to be}} {{the fifth}} and final Montana-class battleship. She was to be named in honor of the 18th state and {{assigned}} to the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia.

25|$|Another {{speculation}} {{stems from}} the original conception of Oz, which at first appeared to be situated in an American desert. If Baum thought of the country of the Munchkins as the nearest region to him, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in <b>the</b> east while he lived in Chicago, but {{when he moved to}} California, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in <b>the</b> west.|$|R

5|$|Officials from Trinidad and Tobago {{reported}} that Joyce made landfall in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any landfall to Joyce. If Joyce really made landfall on Tobago, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first tropical storm {{to do so}} since 1990's Arthur. In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $1.4billion, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> fourth costliest United States hurricanes {{if it were a}} tropical cyclone, and there were 62overall deaths. The flooding spurred changes to warning practices by the National Weather Service and the Government of Virginia. In December2011, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a flood mitigation project in Roanoke, Virginia that began following the 1985 floods.|$|E
5|$|Power {{was to be}} {{supplied}} by all three engines offered to A330-200 and A330-300 with lower gross weight. Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} {{cast doubt}} on the U.S. report's suggestion of possible gunfire from among the refugees. Surviving documents said nothing about infiltrators at No Gun Ri, even though they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> 7th Cavalry's first enemy killed-in-action in Korea. The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E
5000|$|French expresses past {{counterfactual}} conditional {{sentences in}} exactly the same way as English does: the if clause uses the had + past participle (pluperfect) form, while the then clause uses the <b>would</b> <b>have</b> + past participle form, where <b>the</b> equivalent of <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> conditional of the auxiliary (avoir or être) used in all perfect constructions for the verb in question.
