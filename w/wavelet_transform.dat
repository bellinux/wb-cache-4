The FRWT is proposed in order to rectify {{the limitations of the}} WT and the FRFT. This transform not only inherits the advantages of multiresolution analysis of the WT, but also has the capability of signal representations in the fractional domain which is similar to the FRFT. Compared with the existing FRWT, the FRWT (defined by Shi, Zhang, and Liu 2012) can offer signal representations in the time-fractional-frequency plane.|$|E

Also, using the discrete <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform</b> with Haar basis functions, the Gibbs phenomenon does not occur {{at all in the}} case of continuous data at jump discontinuities, and is minimal in the discrete case at large change points. In wavelet analysis, this is commonly referred to as the Longo phenomenon.|$|E

Two {{approaches to the}} implementation of complex <b>wavelet</b> <b>transforms</b> have been proposed earlier. Both approaches require discrete-time allpass systems having approximately linear-phase and (fractional) delay. This paper compares the results when different allpass systems are used. In the earlier work, maximally flat delay allpass systems were used.

40|$|In recent years, several matrix-valued subdivisions {{have been}} {{proposed}} for triangular meshes. The ma-trix-valued subdivisions can simulate and extend the traditional scalar-valued subdivision, such as loop and subdivision. In this paper, we study how to construct the matrix-valued subdivision wavelets, and propose the novel biorthogonal wavelet based on matrix-valued subdivisions on multiresolution triangular meshes. The new <b>wavelets</b> <b>transform</b> not only inherits the advantages of subdivision, but also offers more resolutions of complex models.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new concept of the so-called composite <b>wavelet</b> <b>transforms.</b> These transforms are generated by two components, namely, a kernel function and a wavelet function (or a measure). The composite <b>wavelet</b> <b>transforms</b> and the relevant Calderón-type reproducing formulas constitute a unified approach to explicit inversion of the Riesz, Bessel, Flett, parabolic and some other operators of the potential type generated by ordinary (Euclidean) and generalized (Bessel) translations. This approach is exhibited in the paper. Another concern is application of the composite <b>wavelet</b> <b>transforms</b> to explicit inversion of the k-plane Radon transform on R n.

25|$|The {{development}} of wavelets {{can be linked}} to several separate trains of thought, starting with Haar's work in the early 20th century. Later work by Dennis Gabor yielded Gabor atoms (1946), which are constructed similarly to wavelets, and applied to similar purposes. Notable contributions to wavelet theory can be attributed to Zweig’s discovery of the continuous <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform</b> in 1975 (originally called the cochlear transform and discovered while studying the reaction of the ear to sound), Pierre Goupillaud, Grossmann and Morlet's formulation of what is now known as the CWT (1982), Jan-Olov Strömberg's early work on discrete wavelets (1983), Daubechies' orthogonal wavelets with compact support (1988), Mallat's multiresolution framework (1989), Akansu's Binomial QMF (1990), Nathalie Delprat's time-frequency interpretation of the CWT (1991), Newland's harmonic <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform</b> (1993) and many others since.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difference}} {{in general is}} that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency.

25|$|For the {{discrete}} <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform,</b> {{one needs}} {{at least the}} condition that the wavelet series is {{a representation of the}} identity in the space L2(R).

25|$|Wavelet {{theory is}} {{applicable}} to several subjects. All wavelet transforms {{may be considered}} forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filterbanks. These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform</b> (CWT) {{are subject to the}} uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform</b> of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the time-scale plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.|$|E

25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform.</b>|$|E
25|$|In any {{discretised}} <b>wavelet</b> <b>transform,</b> {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note that not every orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E
