These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary <b>War</b> <b>are</b> still read by historians today.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War all the British Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, {{and some}} Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded, leaving only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade (with {{supporting}} Army elements). As of 2010 the British Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade, which consists of both Royal Marines and British Army components, as well as commando-trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

5|$|Historically, auls were a Circassian type {{of rural}} locality.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia.

Today, the Republic of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are de facto {{functioning}} as one entity, although the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is more monoethnic than the Republic of Armenia, with 99.7% {{of its population}} being Armenian. The Azerbaijani minority {{was forced to leave}} during the war.

40|$|Münkler 2005). Although many {{scholars}} {{use it in}} various ways, there are several common characteristics. According to Mary Kaldor, the new <b>wars</b> can <b>be</b> contrasted with earlier wars {{in terms of their}} goals, the methods of warfare and how they are financed (Kaldor, 2006 : 7). The first characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> its goals. While old <b>wars</b> <b>were</b> about the geo-political or ideological goals, new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> about the identity. Other scholars point out that new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> waged because of greed rather than grievance and that the war itself becomes the purpose (Berdal and Malone, 2000) (F 0 a). The second characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> the changed mode of warfare. As a breakdown of public authority blurs the distinction between public and private combatants, and between combatants and civilians, civilian casualties are increasing and civilians are sometimes deliberately targeted as an object of wars(F 0 b). The third one is the relation between new wars and global economy. The state failures and the civil <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> usually driven by global war economy. It seems plausible that the new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> emerging. However if we look at wars in detail, we can find out some facts that refute the new wars hypothesis. First...|$|R

5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} during the <b>war</b> <b>are</b> not entirely clear. Photographic {{evidence shows that}} four Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns were added, one pair to her searchlight platform and the other pair on the bridge wings, although Ottawa retained her 2-pounder guns even after the Oerlikons were added. 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources for}} this <b>war</b> <b>are</b> mostly of Byzantine origin. Foremost among the {{contemporary}} Greek texts is the Chronicon Paschale by an unidentified author from around 630. George of Pisidia wrote many poems and other works that were contemporary. Theophylact Simocatta has surviving letters {{along with a}} history that gives the political outlook of the Byzantines, but that history only really covers from 582 to 602. Theodore the Synkellos has a surviving speech, which was made during the Siege of Constantinople in 626, that contains useful information for some events. There are some surviving papyri from Egypt from that period.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} no {{official}} figures, Russian ground equipment losses in the <b>war</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be three tanks, at least 20 armoured and 32 non-armoured vehicles lost in combat.

The Russian military had no losses in the artillery, air defence and naval forces.|$|E

5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium <b>War</b> <b>are</b> the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese {{had to be taken}} first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate as}} to when the {{conflict}} started. Proposed dates for the first <b>war</b> <b>are</b> either 547 or 549. At {{the same time as}} the two peoples took the field, a 10,000-strong Byzantine horse army under the command of John, the magister militum of Illyricum, marched against the Gepids. Before John's arrival, Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted. As a result, when the Byzantines arrived, the war had already ended, but not before they had clashed with the Gepids' Herulian allies. To seal the truce, Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up Ildigis, a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court. Thurisind refused, but he did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the US Army renamed its New York-based Ferryboat 84, a {{ferry boat}} that {{traveled}} to Governors Island in the Upper New York Bay, for Charlton. In September 1954, West Virginia renamed a bridge on the West Virginia Turnpike {{in honor of}} Charlton, the Charlton Memorial Bridge on Interstate 77. Charlton was also memorialized in the Bronx, with a park in the Morrisania area being named for Charlton in 1952, and in 1958 several gardens in Van Cortlandt Park in South Bronx were planted in his honor. These gardens are the site of annual Memorial Day gatherings of the local neighborhood where Charlton and other Bronx residents killed in the Korean <b>War</b> <b>are</b> honored. In 1993, a new barracks complex for US Forces Korea in South Korea was also named in Charlton's honor. In 2000, the United States Navy commissioned the USNS Charlton, a Watson-class vehicle cargo ship. Charlton's sister, Fairy M. Papadopoulos, served as the ship's co-sponsor.|$|E
