The stadium is a 20-minute walk from New Street station, which is served by direct trains from {{most parts of the}} country, and slightly less far from Moor Street, which is served by Chiltern Railways trains from London Marylebone. Birmingham Coach Station, served by National Express coaches, is a 15-minute <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> buses run from the city centre past the ground. There is very limited parking at the stadium itself, but a secure outdoor car park is available at Birmingham Wheels Park, less than 15 minutes <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> parking is permitted in the streets surrounding the ground.|$|E
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C-5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent high spirits, New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E
5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E

Geffen's first artist to sign on was Donna Summer, who was anxious to leave Casablanca/PolyGram Records. Geffen shortly after released her The Wanderer album, the lead single of which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the album certified gold. Casablanca countered by releasing more singles off her 1979 Bad Girls album such as the song <b>Walk</b> <b>Away</b> <b>and</b> a similarly named hits compilation to compete, but by then New Wave sound was dominating the airwaves.|$|E

Leng writes of this song-wide message: [...] "It presents his realization {{that he has to}} <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> carry on with his own life.

500|$|When Cyan began development, {{developing}} believable characters {{was a major}} hurdle. The {{brothers were}} limited to one-way communication with the player, and at any point a player could choose to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> [...] "break the spell" [...] of the game. Displaying video in the game was initially infeasible. Designing around the limits, the designers created the trap books, which were location-specific, one-way communication devices. The release of QuickTime halfway through development of the game solved the video issue.|$|E

In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive?

500|$|Some {{witnesses}} {{among the}} regulars reported {{the first shot}} was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or {{around the corner of}} a tavern. Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first. Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot did not come from the men on the ground immediately facing each other. Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited. [...] Some witnesses (on each side) claimed that someone on the other side fired first; [...] however, many more witnesses claimed to not know. [...] Yet another theory is that the first shot was one fired by the British, that killed Asahel Porter, their prisoner who was running away (he had been told to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> he would be let go, though he panicked and began to run). [...] Historian David Hackett Fischer has proposed that there may actually have been multiple near-simultaneous shots. [...] Historian Mark Urban claims the British surged forward with bayonets ready in an undisciplined way, provoking a few scattered shots from the militia. [...] In response the British troops, without orders, fired a devastating volley. [...] This lack of discipline among the British troops had {{a key role in the}} escalation of violence.|$|E
500|$|The {{first three}} episodes {{of the season}} were the three most-watched Poker {{television}} shows in U.S. history. [...] The show aired on Sundays after the FOX National Football League coverage. In the first episode that aired on October 11, contestant Father Andrew Trapp defeated John Salley, Rousso and Negreanu, winning $100,000 {{and a trip to}} the Bahamas in the process, all of which he promised to donate to his church in Garden City, South Carolina. Trapp also won the chance to play in a mini-tournament (Episode 5), the winner of which would play Negreanu for $1,000,000. [...] On October 18, after contestant Tracy Nguyen defeated Bettis and won a trip to the Bahamas, but lost to Barry Greenstein, the next contestant Sergeant Denny Luna defeated Nicole, Moneymaker to win $25,000 and a trip to the Bahamas. Luna then chose to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> (<b>and</b> not risk the $25,000 he had already won) rather than face Negreanu in the $100,000 match. On the November 22 episode after contestant Oluwasegun Odumuyiwa lost to Bettis, Brian Barboza defeated Nicole, Rousso and Negreanu, winning $100,000 and a trip to the Bahamas. Barboza also won the chance to play in a mini-tournament, the winner of which would play Negreanu for $1,000,000. In December Joanna Krupa and Joe Cada were announced as newly added as celebrity and professional opponents. [...] Ortiz and Krupa appeared on the fourth episode, which aired on December 13. [...] Cada appeared, but he did not play a hand. Dwayne Buth, playing on behalf of the Cal State Fullerton wrestling team, lost to Ortiz. Mike Kosowski, a first responder during the September 11 attacks lost to Krupa. [...] The final airing of the competition among the previous winners was expected on December 27. [...] However, when the contestants on the fourth episode all lost, a single table tournament was held to determine the fourth contestant. Kosowski won and then bested Luna, Barboza and Trapp, in that order, in the Challenge of Champions for a $100,000 prize and a chance to play Negreanu for $1million. In three hands of heads up play, he bested Negreanu.|$|E

2500|$|Disappointment about [...] {{the refusal}} to include [...] the working classes in the Great Reform Act of 1832 led to a more {{protracted}} campaign for universal suffrage (known as Chartism) by the radical political unions. The London-based, Owenite inspired National Union of the Working Classes was founded in 1831 by {{former members of the}} Metropolitan Political Union. They organized a constitutional convention at Coldbath-Fields to challenge the British parliament in the spring of 1833. They called for adult male suffrage, the secret ballot, annual elections, equally sized electoral districts, as well as for salaries and the elimination of property qualifications for members of parliament. The government prohibited the meeting, and sent 1,800 police against a crowd of 3,000 or 4,000, leading to a general riot.

2500|$|The {{thirteen}} A Series of Unfortunate Events novels, {{written by}} Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket from 1999 to 2006, achieved success in young adult fiction {{around the same}} time as the Harry Potter novels. As such, the Snicket books had been optioned to be filmed before they were published. This led to the development of a 2004 feature film, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, which covered the narratives of the first three novels in the series. Barry Sonnenfeld, who has expressed his love for the series, was originally slated to direct the feature film, and had hired Handler to write the screenplay. About 10 months into production, shortly after the casting of Jim Carrey as Olaf, there was a [...] "big crisis", according to Handler, which caused producer Scott Rudin to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> Sonnenfeld left the production under unclear terms. With the film's completion in flux, its producing studios Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks fired Handler. While the film was eventually completed and released, sequels which would adapt the other novels in the series became unlikely due to [...] "corporate shakeups" [...] within DreamWorks, according to Handler, and the child actors that portrayed the Baudelaire children grew too old to star in a sequel.|$|E
