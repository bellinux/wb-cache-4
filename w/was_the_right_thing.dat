5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do someday.|$|E

25|$|Delbono {{was forced}} to {{announce}} his resignation as mayor on 25 January 2010 following the revelation {{that he was being}} investigated for crimes such as embezzlement, fraud and aggravated abuse of office. The investigation followed Delbono's former assistant's claim that he had spent public money on her the pair had been having an affair. Investigators subsequently questioned Delbono about the purchase of a property near St. Julian's, Malta. Delbono denied all the allegations made against him and said that resigning as mayor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do.

25|$|The school's mascot is an Indian. In 2004, {{there was}} a major {{controversy}} at the school about the appropriateness of the mascot. The school took up the issue after researching high schools and colleges around the U.S. with similar nicknames that had decided to change their mascots. Many of these schools had received complaints from Native American groups about the stereotypes that the mascots reinforced. The student council also discussed rumors that New Jersey would be banning Native American-related mascots, and eventually it was decided that taking up the issue by choice rather than force <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do. After months of public debate and an official symposium in which students voiced opinions {{from both sides of the}} issue, a vote was held among the students and faculty and the motion to keep the Indian was affirmed, 67% voting in favor of keeping the mascot.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July {{he spoke of the}} “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win”.|$|E

[...] As it transpired, Trescothick scored 193 in the first innings (although England lost the match), and Vaughan returned for the second Test. Trescothick had considered leaving the tour early when his father-in-law had a serious accident, but stayed in Pakistan as fellow opener Andrew Strauss returned home to attend the birth of his first child.|$|E

She was talking to an older man who's, initially, very irritated by her being there, but eventually takes her very, very seriously. There's a touching moment where he acknowledges that to her face.

But the review said that the ending was ambiguous about whether or not Chakotay agrees with what he is doing on behalf of the Co-operative. When reviewing the fourth season for the website DVD Talk, Holly E. Ordway described [...] "Unity" [...] as being [...] "noteworthy as an episode with more depth and complexity than the typical Voyager episode thus far", and said that it was likely to be remembered by the fans as the episode which introduced the Borg to the series.

500|$|During the Vietnam War Gorski {{volunteered to}} serve in the {{military}} [...] "because he thought it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do" [...] even though he could have sought a graduate school deferment. Joining the United States Marine Corps, he attended Marine Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant at Marine Corps Base Quantico in 1967. After this he was deployed to Vietnam, beginning his tour of duty in December 1967. Initially he served as a platoon commander in a motor transport battalion stationed at Gia Le near Da Nang, under the command of Colonel Robert Reilly. While deployed, Gorksi took part in the Battle of Huế during the Tet Offensive, at which time his unit was employed largely in an infantry role. [...] In April 1968, Gorski was the officer responsible for the night watch of battalion headquarters in Gia Le, when a North Vietnamese assault breached the perimeter wire fence. During the skirmish that followed, Gorksi directed artillery and mortar fire. About a dozen North Vietnamese were killed in the engagement, along with three Marines. In January 1969 Gorski returned to the United States, having risen to the rank of captain. He earned no medals for bravery, however, nor was he wounded.|$|E
500|$|The case of R v Baillie, a {{prosecution}} for criminal libel, opened on 23 November 1778 at 1pm before Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice, in the Court of King's Bench. Prior to this, Baillie and his counsel had been debating {{how to respond}} to the case; Bearcroft, Peckham, Murphy and Hargrave advocated negotiating a settlement before it went to trial, while Erskine urged them to argue Baillie's case before the court and eventually succeeded in convincing Baillie that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do. The case opened with an address by Sir John Scott, the Solicitor General for England and Wales, who was prosecuting Baillie, followed by [...] "long, dreary" [...] speeches by Bearcroft, Peckham, Murphy and Hargrave, defending him. An illness that befell Hargrave caused several interruptions to the proceedings, and as a result darkness had fallen by the time he finished speaking. Lord Mansfield announced that rather than dragging the proceedings out late into the night, the court session would end for the evening and resume the next morning, when Erskine would have his chance to speak. Erskine recognised this as a great opportunity, as it would present him with a refreshed court the following day, rather than an exhausted one; he said later that he [...] "always blessed God for the providential [...] of Hargrave".|$|E

500|$|On August 13, 2004, Spears {{announced}} through Jive Records {{the release}} of her first greatest hits compilation titled , due November 16, 2004. The title was chosen after the album's lead single, Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's 1988 single [...] "My Prerogative". The cover was produced by Swedish production team Bloodshy & Avant, who produced her single [...] "Toxic" [...] from her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). A DVD [...] was also released the same day, containing Spears's music videos. The track list was officially revealed on September 13, 2004. Greatest Hits: My Prerogative included three new tracks: [...] "My Prerogative", [...] "I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'", all of them produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The producers recorded and arranged the main instrumentation of [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] at Murlyn Studios, in Stockholm, Sweden. Spears recorded her vocals at Battery Studios in New York City. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Angela Hunte and BlackCell. The song was never planned to be released as a single.

500|$|Donald P. Baker of The Washington Post {{commented that}} Mathias' lasting {{reputation}} {{would be that}} of a maverick. Though {{he was elected to}} the House in 1960 as a moderate/conservative, his life in the Congress moved him to the center, and he frequently deviated from the party line and sided with Democrats. The fact that he [...] "went out of his way to disassociate himself from [...] " [...] in the 1980 elections had hindered his chances at a chairmanship. Mathias also established a record on civil rights, having played an important role in passing a fair housing bill while he was in the House, and also in establishing a national holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He held liberal views on abortion, defense spending, and the Equal Rights Amendment, and, along with Senator John Warner of Virginia, was one of the sponsors of a bill to authorize the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. In discussing Mathias' retirement, Tom Wicker of The New York Times commented that [...] "he was fair, flexible, concerned, able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility". When Wicker asked him which senators he respected the most, Mathias listed J. William Fulbright (D), Jacob Javits (R), John Sherman Cooper (R), Cliff Case (R), Phil Hart (D), Mike Mansfield (D), and George Aiken (R), because [...] "each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility...

Yoko Ono was hesitant about allowing Glee {{the rights to}} [...] "Imagine". Series music supervisor P.J. Bloom explained: [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} convince Yoko Ono that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do. She needed to truly understand how the music was going to be used. The added component of us wanting to have a deaf choir signing the song made for this incredibly poignant moment. ...It really took a lot of convincing to get her on board and realize that it was a great, great moment, and a tribute to John and his song." [...] Jenna Ushkowitz has commented that the performance of [...] "Imagine" [...] brought the cast and crew of Glee to tears, and that several cast members got [...] "Imagine" [...] tattoos afterwards as it was [...] "such a nice checkpoint in our lives."
