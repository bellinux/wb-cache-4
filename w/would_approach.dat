5|$|The {{surrender}} of Burgoyne's army at Saratoga, brought France into the war, {{and in the}} summer of 1778 a pincer plan was agreed to recapture Newport: the Continental Army <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> overland, and a French Fleet would sail into the harbour. To prevent the latter the British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth. Between 3 and 6 August a fleet of Royal Navy and hired craft, including Lord Sandwich 2, were scuttled at various locations in the Bay. Lord Sandwich 2, previously Endeavour, previously Earl of Pembroke, was sunk on 4 August 1778.|$|E
5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's advice on the local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein.

Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems.|$|E
5|$|Mondo Cane {{consists}} of Mike Patton's arrangements and performances of 1950s and 1960s Italian pop songs. Patton had heard these songs {{while living in}} Bologna; the singer had adopted {{the city as a}} second home after marrying Italian artist Titi Zuccatosta, and had become a fluent speaker of Italian. Patton began exploring Italian popular music; although initially wishing to listen to contemporary music, he found nothing that interested him. However, he became drawn to pop music from the 1950s and 1960s, intrigued by singers using orchestras for backing rather than pop bands. Having considered making an album covering these songs for some time, Patton initially believed he <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> the project with a small band, but was offered the chance to compose music for an orchestra. Patton then opted to use this opportunity to record Mondo Cane instead.|$|E

Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling.|$|E
5|$|The first raids {{came as a}} {{surprise}} and were met by ineffective responses. On the first raid a Beaufighter from 604 Squadron shot down a single bomber, while the next three raids resulted in no kills, and the next a single kill again. But as the pattern of the attacks grew more obvious—short attacks against smaller coastal cities—the defense responded. Four bombers were shot down on the night of 3/4 May, two more on 7/8th, one on 18th, two on the 23rd. The Luftwaffe changed their tactics as well; their bombers <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> at low altitude, climb to spot the target, and then dive again after releasing their bombs. This meant that interceptions with the Mk. IV were possible only during the bomb run.|$|E

5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E
5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} {{he learned}} about a federal dollar-for-dollar matching grant program. In his senior year and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. The fees were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative {{in the sense that}} it only assumes the fees from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E
5|$|Despite DuPont's grand {{boulevard}} {{not coming}} to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative {{as one of the}} earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing MilfordDover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.|$|E

5|$|On May 27, 1862, Colonel Crook's 3rd Brigade routed rebel {{infantry}} in {{a conflict}} where the shooting lasted for only 27 minutes. Rebel casualties were 72 men killed, over 100 wounded, and 157 men taken prisoner. They also lost four cannon, 300 small weapons, and 25 horses. Crook's brigade lost 13 killed, 50 wounded (including Crook, who {{was shot in the}} foot), and 6 missing. The feat was accomplished by taking advantage of aggressive rebel soldiers and a hostile town. Crook had learned that a large rebel infantry under the command of General Henry Heth was moving toward Lewisburg. Crook positioned his brigade {{at the far end of}} the town, and sent a small group of pickets to the opposite end where the rebels <b>would</b> <b>approach.</b> Heth's rebels raced into town after the pickets, urged on by the pro-rebel local population. The rebels were quickly ambushed in a short action that ended after a charge by Union infantry and cavalry. The 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry battalion had been held out of the fighting, but was used to chase the fleeing rebels. The rebels escaped by burning the Greenbrier Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> a professional matchmaker (ah atanzah), who <b>would</b> <b>approach</b> the potential bride's family. The parents of the young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal.
