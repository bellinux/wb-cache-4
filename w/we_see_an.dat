In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, {{so that we can}} speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.|$|E

The {{winner of the}} contest would get to see their story becoming a plot for an official music video of a song.

The animated music video, directed by PUNY, debuted on July 27, 2009, and was released for purchase via iTunes on September 4, 2009. The video begins with an animated Danja saying his introduction of the song, while paparazzi are in the background taking several pictures. Then, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> animated Spears jumping into her rocket ship, flying and avoiding several paparazzi that are following her. She hides on another planet, turning all the lights of it on as she walks, and escaping the paparazzi that later appear to stalk her. However, Spears manages to avoid them, flying away into space in her rocket ship again, but this time exploding the planet and [...] "killing all the lights" [...] of it maneuvering a joystick.|$|E
500|$|Although Eko survives the implosion, he is dragged {{away by a}} polar bear. Locke and Charlie later rescue him {{and pull}} him to safety. In [...] "The Cost of Living", Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent, telling him he needs to confess before finding [...] his tent is on fire. Searching for Yemi, he soon decides to follow Locke, Desmond, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro) to the Pearl station. While waiting outside, he sees Yemi again, and follows the {{apparition}} to give his confession. Upon learning it is merely a deception, Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle, where he confronts the [...] "Monster". After being thrown about by the Monster, Eko is finally thrown to the ground. Fatally wounded, he whispers [...] "I saw the Devil" [...] to Locke before dying, although Locke, for whatever reason, decides to tell Sayid he said, [...] "We're next." [...] As he dies, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> image of Eko and Yemi as happy children, walking into the distance. In one of the flashforwards in the final episode of the fourth season, Hurley is seen {{sitting at a table}} with a chessboard on it across from a seemingly empty seat.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} an opening caption that reads [...] "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while {{covering}} herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When {{he is at the}} office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him and}} sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E

When the latter itself bears a few flowers, as we know sometimes is the case, and still retains the power of clasping a support, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> early condition of all those tendrils which have been formed by the modification of flower- peduncles.|$|E
60|$|ZANY, n.
