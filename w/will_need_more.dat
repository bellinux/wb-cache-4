While regular dwarves {{will be happy}} with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during imipenem treatment, and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) for imipenem is lower than for ceftazidime. However, no clinically relevant difference was found in mortality between imipenem and ceftazidime treatments. [...] The MIC of meropenem is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> frequent or higher doses.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study in}} the April, 2007 issue of Environment and Urbanization reports that 634 million people live in coastal areas within [...] of sea level. The study also {{reported}} that about {{two thirds of the}} world's cities with over five million people are located in these low-lying coastal areas. Future sea level rise could lead to potentially catastrophic difficulties for shore-based communities in the next centuries: for example, many major cities such as Venice, London, New Orleans, and New York City already need storm-surge defenses, and <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> if the sea level rises; they also face issues such as subsidence. However, modest increases in sea level are likely to be offset when cities adapt by constructing sea walls or through relocating.|$|E

2500|$|In general, Kuznets curves {{have been}} found for some {{environmental}} health concerns (such as air pollution) but not for others (such as landfills and biodiversity). Advocates of the EKC argue that this does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis – {{the scale of the}} Kuznets curves may differ for different environmental impacts and different regions. If the search for scalar and regional effects can salvage the concept, it may yet be the case that a given area <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> wealth in order to see a decline in environmental pollutants. In contrast, a thermodynamically enlightened economics suggests that outputs of degraded matter and energy are an inescapable consequence of any use of matter and energy (so holds the second law); some of those degraded outputs will be noxious wastes, and whether and how their production is eliminated depends more on regulatory schemes and technologies at use than on income or production levels. [...] In one view, then, the EKC suggests that [...] "the solution to pollution is more economic growth;" [...] in the other, pollution is seen as a regrettable output that should be reduced when the benefits brought by its production are exceeded by the costs it imposes in externalities like health decrements and loss of ecosystem services.|$|E

25|$|The unwholesome states (akusala) are {{described}} in the Buddhist texts, as those relating to thoughts, emotions, intentions, and these include pancanivarana (five hindrances) - sensual thoughts, doubts about the path, restlessness, drowsiness, and ill will of any kind. Of these, the Buddhist traditions consider sensual thoughts and ill <b>will</b> <b>needing</b> <b>more</b> right effort. Sensual desire that must be eliminated by effort includes anything related to sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch. Ill will that must be eliminated by effort includes any form of aversion including hatred, anger, resentment towards anything or anyone.|$|R

60|$|The {{necessity}} of making such efforts as this, however, {{to keep up}} the interest of the class in their work, and to make it pleasant to them, will depend altogether upon circumstances; or rather, it will vary much with circumstances.
