25|$|On 7 February 2007, the London-based Privy Council {{ordered a}} re-sentencing of Coard {{and the others}} convicted for the 1983 killing of Bishop {{and some of his}} cabinet colleagues. The hearing began on 18 June. On 27 June, the judge gave Coard and his fellow {{defendants}} a 30-year sentence, which included the time already spent in prison. On 5 September 2009, Coard was released from prison. Upon release {{he said he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in politics again.|$|E
25|$|An online fan {{campaign}} {{attempted to}} save My So-Called Life, {{the first such}} event {{in the history of}} the World Wide Web. The arduous schedule and the mental and physical demands of the production of episodic television, however, caused difficulties for the young actors who had to balance schoolwork with rehearsal and time on the set. Herskovitz said Danes and her parents approached the show's creators and told producers that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> with the show if it continued for a second season.|$|E

25|$|However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on {{numerous}} occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in another Western film.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Stanford {{looked to}} expand the tournament, and decided once again to feature a high-stakes game {{featuring}} {{the best players in}} the West Indies versus an international team. Stanford initially wished to invite Sri Lanka, India, Australia and South Africa to come and play a single elimination tournament in Antigua, with the winner facing his all-star team. However due to contractual issues with the ICC and ESPN-Star and scheduling constraints that tournament was infeasible. Instead, Stanford invited the winners of the World Twenty20, India, to play for a prize of US$5 million (later US$10 million) and planned to ask Australia to come as a back-up should India decline or be unavailable. India, who were in the process of launching the highly successful first year of their domestic Twenty20 league, the Indian Premier League, declined as they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in a privately funded programme.|$|E
25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the stories}} that followed, many {{students}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved,</b> but few <b>were</b> willing <b>to</b> let their names or faces appear in the film.

500|$|As {{polls showed}} Parizeau's {{approach}} as highly unlikely to even exceed 40% support in a referendum, {{leaders of the}} movement engaged in a heated public debate. After Parizeau moved the planned referendum date to the fall, Deputy Premier Bernard Landry aroused ire by stating he would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in a [...] "charge of the light brigade." [...] During the Bloc's April conference, after a speech demanding a change in direction, Bouchard expressed ambivalence to a radio show about participating if a partnership proposal was not included. [...] Mario Dumont, leader of the new Action démocratique du Québec, also stated that he would only consider participation in the referendum if a partnership was made part of the question.|$|E
500|$|Silver's final {{recordings}} {{with the}} Jazz Messengers were in May 1956. Later that year, he left Blakey after {{one and a}} half years, {{in part because of the}} heroin use prevalent in the band, which Silver did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in. Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material they played, and, in concert, he [...] "won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. He crouched over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys and his feet pounding." ...|$|E
500|$|Wigner {{accepted}} {{a position as}} the Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in early 1946. Because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in administrative duties, he became co-director of the laboratory, with James Lum handling the administrative chores as executive director. When the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{took charge of the}} laboratory's operations at the start of 1947, Wigner feared that many of the technical decisions would be made in Washington. He also saw the Army's continuation of wartime security policies at the laboratory as a [...] "meddlesome oversight", interfering with research. One such incident occurred in March 1947, when the AEC discovered that Wigner's scientists were conducting experiments with a critical mass of uranium-235 when the Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of Louis Slotin at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Wigner argued that Groves's order had been superseded, but was forced to terminate the experiments, which were completely different from the one that killed Slotin.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a {{miscarriage}} scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Burton {{regularly}} {{thought about}} the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director. Disney {{was looking forward to}} Nightmare [...] "to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit." [...] Nightmare marked Burton's third film in a row to have a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> with [...] "the painstakingly slow process of stop motion". To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs. Elfman found writing Nightmares eleven songs as [...] "one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington." [...] Caroline Thompson still had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, [...] "there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually." ...|$|E

A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000 (€15,000) in donations for this cause.|$|E
2500|$|Kyokushin's 5th World Tournament, in 1991, was a {{significant}} point {{in the history of}} the IKO. Arneil stated simply, [...] "It was a fixed tournament."

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in the politics anymore. I left the IKO, not Kyokushin."

By late August, 2009 figures produced by Response suggested that only 2% within the Liberal Party wanted to collaborate with the Progress Party. Sponheim later distanced himself and his party from the Conservative Party because the Conservatives wanted to improve relations with the Progress Party, leading Sponheim to comment [...] "A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for the Progress Party". He said that the Liberal Party was the only solid choice on the right that didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in a government with the Progress Party.|$|E
