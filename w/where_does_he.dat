500|$|Booker gained {{national}} attention when, on December 28, 2010, a constituent used Twitter {{to ask him}} to send someone to her father's house to shovel his driveway because her elderly father was going to attempt to do it himself. Booker responded by tweeting, [...] "I will do it myself; <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> live?" [...] Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway. On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend. Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Steven Moffat {{has said}} that {{reference}} {{will be made to}} Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: [...] "The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so <b>where</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?” In [...] "Deep Breath" [...] (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In [...] "The Girl Who Died" [...] (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision {{to save the life of}} Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so.|$|E
