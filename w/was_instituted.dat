5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central {{administrative}} system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which <b>was</b> <b>instituted</b> by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following {{the execution of the}} Chancellor Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the Censorate, and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions. Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, <b>was</b> <b>instituted,</b> but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E
5|$|Over {{most of its}} route, the East Plains Trail {{went through}} a post-glacial {{landscape}} of lakes, moraines, and drumlins, with beautiful scenery and difficult swamps.

5|$|The Victoria Cross (VC) <b>was</b> <b>instituted</b> in 1856 as the British Empire's highest {{decoration}} for valour.

On average, there are about 240 solar eclipses each century.|$|E
5|$|Several bestowals of {{the award}} have met with criticism. The posthumous award for M. G.

As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers. Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.|$|E
5|$|A library {{has been}} present {{since the time}} of StWerburgh's Abbey, and {{following}} the dissolution of the monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, but by the 19thcentury it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s but by the 1980s the contents were contained in five separate sites around the cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents <b>was</b> <b>instituted.</b> During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits by groups.|$|E

5|$|After Morocco's {{independence}} in 1956, {{a strong emphasis}} was laid on the country's Arab identity, and a national Arabic language educational system <b>was</b> <b>instituted,</b> in which Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Tamazight, had no place. However, in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages, including Central Atlas Tamazight. For the promotion of Tamazight and other Berber languages and cultures, the government created the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the water}} regime due to the {{construction}} of the Ithai barrage across the Manipur River have caused changes in the vegetation composition of the phumdis. A study <b>was</b> <b>instituted,</b> from October 2005 to July 2006, to record the vegetation composition and productivity of phumdis in areas of ranging thickness, water depth and soil pH, accumulating data in both summer and winter. The study recorded 83 plant species of 21 families (Poaceae and Cyperaceae formed the dominant families); 81 species were recorded in summer and 48 in winter.|$|E
5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during {{the immediate aftermath of}} the hurricane.

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to divert {{attention}} from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís <b>was</b> <b>instituted.</b> An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1982 season, {{only nine}} regular season games were played, and a {{modified}} playoff format <b>was</b> <b>instituted.</b> Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games {{wiped out by}} the strike, although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became {{the first time that}} teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland Browns and the 4–5 Detroit Lions.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were also}} {{motivated}} by positive means. New medals were instituted: the Military Cross {{was created in}} December 1914 for warrant officers and officers up to captain, the Military Medal for enlisted men in March 1916 (although to the regret of some men, it did not carry a cash bounty like the Distinguished Conduct Medal). The Order of the British Empire (of which the MBE is one grade) <b>was</b> <b>instituted</b> in 1917. By 1918, medals for bravery were often awarded within a week {{to ensure that the}} man lived long enough to receive it.|$|E
