5|$|During the British period, Sandakan grew {{quickly as}} one of the largest British {{settlements}} on the east coast of North Borneo including having been the former capital of the territory. It grew rapidly due to the export activities as a port town. The port is important for palm oil, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, manila hemp and sago exports. In the mid-1930s, the export of tropical timber from Sandakan recorded a level of 180,000 cubic metres which made the town as the world's largest exporter of hardwood. Many Sandakan <b>wood</b> <b>logs</b> are now found in Beijing's Temple of Heaven. Sandakan also enjoyed modern developments such as telegraph service to London and paved streets before Hong Kong and Singapore.|$|E

500|$|The company owned 54ships {{during its}} 122years of existence, many being small cargo vessels. Originally, {{all of the}} line's steamboats were of wooden {{construction}} with side paddlewheels and used <b>wood</b> <b>logs</b> for fuel. The first boat with an iron hull acquired by the Old Bay Line was the Georgeanna, in 1860. By the late 1870s, the company had acquired its last paddlewheel steamers: Florida, Carolina, and Virginia. Later, ships would use coal for fuel until the 1930s, when oil began to be used. Beginning with the Georgia built in 1887, their ships used the more modern propeller or [...] "screw" [...] design. The Georgia also was the first Old Bay Line vessel to be equipped with electric lighting and steam heating. Passenger ships of the line provided large, lavishly furnished staterooms to accommodate passengers on the overnight trip. The Alabama built in 1892 represented the inception of modern shipbuilding and design for the Old Bay Line: the first vessel to have a steel hull instead of iron or wood and propelled by a four-cylinder triple-expansion reciprocating engine, the same type engine {{that all of the}} line's later steamers would have. Notable Old Bay Line passenger vessels used in scheduled overnight service, with dates acquired and gross tonnages, were: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of the pyrolysis process of a dry and wet birch <b>wood</b> <b>log</b> in a cylindrical heating chamber is preformed. The model includes the flow {{inside and outside}} the porous <b>wood</b> <b>log</b> and accounts for convective, conductive and radiative heat transfer. A two-step pyrolysis reaction scheme is used to model the conversion from wood to tar, gas and char. The results of the simulations compare well with the authors experimental data which are presented in terms of radial temperature distribution and mass reduction, for both dry and wet cases. Our transient simulations provide us with the detailed flow field {{inside and outside the}} <b>wood</b> <b>log.</b> It clearly shows not only the existence but also the structure of the pyrolysis gas plumes leaving the wood. These plumes have only been visualised experimentally by few authors [Brackmann C et al. Optical and mass spectroscopy study of the pyrolysis gas of wood particles. Appl Spectros 2003; 57 (2) : 216 - 22, [12]] without any quantitative measurements and the present investigation gives a realistic estimation that we presently use to evaluate its impact on the heat and mass transfer, and on the momentum balance and the particle dispersion in a near future work. The gas plumes have a maximum velocity magnitude ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 2 Â mÂ s- 1 and vanish when all the wood gas is produced. It is shown that increasing the convective flow around the <b>wood</b> <b>log</b> do not significantly modify the pyrolysis gas plume structure and seems to have small effect on the overall heating and the pyrolysis process which are mainly controlled by the thermal radiation from the hot surrounding walls.

6000|$|One of Euphemia's {{brightest}} ideas was to burn <b>wood.</b> <b>Logs</b> {{make even}} a picturesque pile in a corner--look [...] "uncommon." [...] But there are objections to wood. Wood finely divided burns with gay quirks and jets of flame, and making cheerful crackling noises the while; but its warmth and brightness are as evanescent as love's young dream. And your solid log {{has a certain}} irritating inertness. It is an absentee fuel, spending its fire up the chimney, and after its youthful clouds of glory turns but a cheerless side {{of black and white}} char towards the room. And, above all, the marital mind is strangely exasperated by the log. Smite it with the poker, and you get but a sullen resonance, a flight of red sparks, a sense of an unconquerable toughness. It is worse than coke. The crisp fracture of coal, the spitting flames suddenly leaping into existence from the shiny new fissures, are altogether wanting. Old-seasoned timber burns indeed most delightfully, but then it is as ugly as coal, and withal very dear. So Euphemia went back to coal again with a sigh. Possibly if Euphemia had been surrounded by the wealth she deserves this trouble would not have arisen. A silent servant, bearing the due dose of fresh fuel, would have come gliding from a mysterious Beneath, restored the waning animation of the grate, and vanished noiselessly again. But this was beyond the range of Euphemia's possibilities. And so we are face to face with this problem of the scuttle again.|$|E

60|$|For {{the second}} time she avoided meeting his eves {{as she left the}} room. Tallente stood on the hearth-rug, still looking at the closed door through which she had vanished, puzzled, a little chilled. He gave his order to the {{attentive}} butler who presently appeared and who looked at him with covert interest,--the Press had been almost hysterically prodigal of his name during the last few weeks. Then he settled down to wait for her return with an impatience which became almost uncontrollable. It seemed to him, as he paced restlessly about, that this little apartment, which he remembered so well, had in a measure changed, was revealing a different atmosphere, as though in sympathy with some corresponding change in its presiding spirit. There was a huge and well-worn couch, smothered with cushions and suggestive of a comfort almost voluptuous; a large easy-chair, into which he presently sank, of the same character. The <b>wood</b> <b>logs</b> burning in the grate gave out a pleasant sense of warmth. He took more particular note of the volumes in the well-filled bookcases,--volumes of poetry, French novels, with a fair sprinkling of modern English fiction. There was a plaster cast of the Paris Magdalene over the door and one or two fine point etchings, after the style of Heillieu, upon the walls. There was no writing table in the room, nor any signs of industry, but a black oak gate-table was laden with magazines and fashion papers. Against the brown walls, a clump of flaming yellow gorse leaned from a distant corner, its faint almond-like fragrance mingling aromatically with the perfume of burning logs and a great bowl of dried lavender. More than ever it seemed to Tallente that the atmosphere of the room had changed, had become in some subtle way at the same time more enervating and more exciting. It was like a revelation of a hidden side of the woman, who might indeed have had some purpose of her own in leaving him here. He set down his empty glass with the feeling that vermouth was a heavier drink than he had fancied. Then a streak of watery sunshine filtered its way through the plantation and crept across the worn, handsome carpet. He felt a queer exultation at the sound of her footsteps outside. She entered, as she had departed, without directly meeting his earnest gaze.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the steady-state {{modeling and simulation}} of a <b>wood</b> <b>log</b> fired boiler. It is designed and manufactured by THERMODYNAMIKI S. A. (KOMBI), a company based on Northern Greece. Its nominal fuel power is around 32 kW and its efficiency is close to 75 %. A specific operating case, selected and experimentally investigated by the manufacturer, is examined. Due to the highly transient and complex nature of <b>wood</b> <b>log</b> combustion, an ad-hoc model has been developed. Its main characteristic is the fuel division into three components: water vapor, volatiles and fixed char. The latter is considered to form a layer, which is treated as a porous medium thus forming a volumetric source zone adjacent to the firebed area. Volatiles and water vapor are modeled as volumetric mass sources, whereas a two-step reaction mechanism of the former is considered. The numerical results are compared against corresponding experimental data for the nominal load as far as flue gas characteristics (temperature and species concentration) at the boiler exit, are concerned. Based on the validated model, a proposed optimization pattern of the boiler is undertaken and examined by means of CFD...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{investigated}} the emissions, including odor, from <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> stoves, burning wood types indigenous to mid-European {{countries such as}} Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, as well as Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria (Germany) and South Tyrol (Italy). The investigations were performed with a modern, certified, 8 kW, manually fired <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> stove, {{and the results were}} compared to emissions from a modern 9 kW pellet stove. The examined wood types were deciduous species: black locust, black poplar, European hornbeam, European beech, pedunculate oak (also known as “common oak”), sessile oak, turkey oak and conifers: Austrian black pine, European larch, Norway spruce, Scots pine, silver fir, as well as hardwood briquettes. In addition, “garden biomass” such as pine cones, pine needles and dry leaves were burnt in the <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> stove. The pellet stove was fired with softwood pellets. The composite average emission rates for <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> and briquettes were 2030 mgMJ− 1 for CO; 89 mgMJ− 1 for NOx, 311 mgMJ− 1 for CxHy, 67 mgMJ− 1 for particulate matter PM 10 and average odor concentration was at 2430 OUm− 3. CO, CxHy and PM 10 emissions from pellets combustion were lower by factors of 10, 13 and 3, while considering NOx – comparable to the <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> emissions. Odor from pellets combustion was not detectable. CxHy and PM 10 emissions from garden biomass (needles and leaves) burning were 10 times higher than for <b>log</b> <b>wood,</b> while CO and NOx rise only slightly. Odor levels ranged from not detectable (pellets) to around 19, 000 OUm− 3 (dry leaves). The odor concentration correlated with CO, CxHy and PM 10. For <b>log</b> <b>wood</b> combustion average odor ranged from 536 OUm− 3 for hornbeam to 5217 OUm− 3 for fir, indicating a considerable influence of the wood type on odor concentration...|$|R
