On working the machine the electricity proceeded from the conductor through the <b>wire</b> <b>point</b> to the litmus paper, and thence away by {{the intervention of the}} string to the air, so that there was (as in the last experiment) but one metallic pole; still acid was evolved there as freely as in any former case.|$|E
6000|$|... 425. The {{order of}} {{arrangement}} {{in the course}} of the electric current was as follows. The positive pole of the battery was connected by a wire with the platina plate in the ice; the plate was in contact with the ice, the ice with the tin jacket, the jacket with a wire, which communicated with a piece of tin foil, on which rested one end of a bent platina wire (312.), the other or decomposing end being supported on paper moistened with solution of iodide of potassium (316.): the paper was laid flat on a platina spatula connected with the negative end of the battery. All that part of the arrangement between the ice vessel and the decomposing <b>wire</b> <b>point,</b> including both these, was insulated, so that no electricity might pass through the latter which had not traversed the former also.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known GM {{data communication}} link from one electronic module to another {{was introduced in}} the 1980 model year Cadillacs. The link was one <b>wire</b> <b>point</b> to point, linking the engine control module to the fuel data panel. [...] In model year 1981 all GM passenger cars for the US market used a similar data link to a test connector for assembly line diagnostics. The value of this data in diagnosing emission systems after customer delivery was quickly identified. Scanner tools were made to view and interpret the data stream. The data line was the same line that turned on the [...] "Check Engine" [...] lamp in the instrument panel. Data was sent at 80 bits per sec. 9 bits per frame, 21 bytes (frames), 2.4 sec./transmission.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} Kirschner (K-) <b>wire</b> <b>point</b> wasdeveloped {{and compared}} in fresh pig femora {{in terms of}} drilling efficiency and temperature elevation with the trochar and diamond points currently used in clinical practice. The tips of thermal couples were machined to the defined geometry and the temperature measured during drilling. Using the same drill speed (rev/min) and feed rate, the new K-wire point produced the lowest thrust force and torque as measured by a Kistler dynamometer. Drill point temperatures were highest with the trochar geometry (129 ± 6 °C), followed by the diamond (98 ± 7 °C). The lowest temperatures were recorded with the Medin K-wire (66 ± 2 °C). On repeated drilling {{it could be used}} for up to 30 holes before reaching the less satisfactory drill performance of the diamond tip. The new K-wire provides a better alternative as it requires less effort for insertion, generates less heat and may be re-used...|$|E

The overall objective is to increase the yield percentage by minimizing the carding waste with the help of stationary flats, and also improving the quality of ring spun yarn. This research is partial to the performance of stationary flats only, and does not involve other parts of carding machine. Further research may be carried out on other parts of the carding machine as well. The paper tries to identify the best combination of stationary flats on C- 60 Q-pack carding machine for cotton fiber...|$|R

He patented his fence in May 1873 and exhibited {{it at the}} DeKalb County Fair that summer. This prompted Haish and other DeKalb residents Isaac Ellwood and Joseph Glidden to work on improving the concept. Haish had patented three styles of barbed fencing by June 1874. When Haish's patent for an [...] "S-barb" [...] design was granted in August 1875, he launched a drawn out legal battle to stymie his rivals.

5000|$|Smith was {{influenced}} by the Banshees' [...] "wall of noise" [...] and the Buzzcocks' melodies, and aspired to combine the two. Ian Birch of Melody Maker recognised the Banshees' influence on Smith's band early on, comparing the Cure's 1978 debut single Killing An Arab favourably to Siouxsie's Hong Kong Garden (released a few short months earlier). Along with the Banshees, early Cure gigs from 1978-1979 supporting post-punk bands such as Wire and Joy Division influenced Robert shift in musical direction from the Cure's 1979 album, Three Imaginary Boys, to 1980's sophomore effort, Seventeen Seconds. Playing support for Wire (at Kent University in October 1978) gave Smith the idea [...] "to follow a different course, to hold out against the punk wave ... <b>Wire</b> <b>pointed</b> out another direction to me." ...|$|R

The {{pieces of}} litmus and {{turmeric}} paper were now placed each upon a separate plate of glass, and connected by an insulated string four feet long, moistened {{in the same}} solution of sulphate of soda: the terminal decomposing <b>wire</b> <b>points</b> were placed upon the papers as before. On working the machine, the same evolution of acid and alkali appeared as in the former instance, and with equal readiness, notwithstanding that the places of their appearance were four feet apart from each other. Finally, a piece of string, seventy feet long, was used. It was insulated in the air by suspenders of silk, so that the electricity passed through its entire length: decomposition took place exactly as in former cases, alkali and acid appearing at the two extremities in their proper places.|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies on}} {{measurement}} and characterization of wireless LANs (WLANs) {{have been performed}} recently. Most of these measurements have been conducted from the wired portion of the network based on wired monitoring (e. g. sniffer at some <b>wired</b> <b>point)</b> or SNMP statistics. More recently, wireless monitoring, the traffic measurement from a wireless vantage point, is also widely adopted in both wireless research and commercial WLAN management product development. Wireless monitoring technique can provide detailed PHY/MAC information on wireless medium. For the network diagnosis purpose (e. g. anomaly detection and security monitoring) such detailed wireless information is more useful than the information provided by SNMP or wired monitoring. In this paper we have explored various issues in implementing the wireless monitoring system for an IEEE 802. 11 based wireless network.

6000|$|... 356. Another {{reason for}} the {{decomposition}} being electrochemical is, that a Wollaston's apparatus constructed with wires, coated by sealing-wax, would most probably not have decomposed water, even in its own peculiar way, unless the electricity had risen high enough in intensity to produce sparks in {{some part of the}} circuit; whereas the torpedo was not able to produce sensible sparks. A third reason is, that the purer the water in Wollaston's apparatus, the more abundant is the decomposition; and I have found that a machine and <b>wire</b> <b>points</b> which succeeded perfectly well with distilled water, failed altogether when the water was rendered a good conductor by sulphate of soda, common salt, or other saline bodies. But in Dr. Davy's experiments with the torpedo, strong solutions of salt, nitrate of silver, and superacetate of lead were used successfully, and there is no doubt with more success than weaker ones.|$|R

50|$|A Beverage antenna {{consists}} of a horizontal wire from one-half to several wavelengths long (hundreds of feet at HF to several kilometres for longwave) suspended above the ground, with the feedline to the receiver attached to one end and the other terminated through a resistor to ground. The antenna has a unidirectional radiation pattern with the main lobe of the pattern at a shallow angle into the sky off the resistor-terminated end, making it ideal for reception of long distance skywave (skip) transmissions from stations over the horizon which reflect off the ionosphere. However the antenna must be built so the <b>wire</b> <b>points</b> {{at the location of}} the transmitter. Some Beverage antennas use a two-wire design that allows reception in two directions from a single Beverage antenna. Other designs use sloped ends where the center of the antenna is six to eight feet high and both ends of the antenna gradually slope downwards towards the termination resistor and matching transformer.|$|R
40|$|Traces is an artwork for the CAVE {{that uses}} a novel machine vision system to enable {{unencumbered}} full body interaction {{with a range of}} semi-autonomous agents without the imposition of any sort of textual, iconic or encoded-gestural interfaces and without physically restrictive <b>wiring,</b> <b>pointing</b> devices, or headgear. Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a "world" which is "navigated "; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement which slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary HCI: (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of "interactivity" itself.

40|$|To {{investigate}} requisites {{for evaluating}} the comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres, I measured changes in clothing pressure that felt comfortable at rest (normal standing posture) and subjective evaluation during movement. Clothing pressure data were measured at 0. 1 -second intervals, and the average of those was considered the synthetic value of the clothing pressure. The difference between the maximum and the minimum values of clothing pressure that varied according to respiration and movement was considered the change in clothing pressure. Changes in clothing pressure and subjective evaluation due to the removal of straps were also studied. Samples were four types of underwired brassieres of different designs including strapless brassieres. Points measured were the six points where thick fabric with wires or rubber tapes may tightly press the skin; the intersections of the lower hem and mammillary lines (points a and a 2 ̆ 7), those of the lower hem and side <b>wires</b> (<b>points</b> b and b 2 ̆ 7), {{and those of the}} upper hem and side <b>wires</b> (<b>points</b> c and c 2 ̆ 7). The results are reported as follows: 1) The brassieres that felt comfortable at rest were not necessarily comfortable during movement. It may be necessary to confirm subjective evaluation during movement to evaluate the comfortable clothing pressure. 2) The brassieres with small changes in clothing pressure tended to give a slightly tight impression. Thus, the changes in clothing pressure during movement should be studied when evaluating the comfortable clothing pressure. 3) The positions of straps tended to influence the distribution of clothing pressure at the lower hem of the brassieres. Therefore, it was difficult to determine a comfortable clothing pressure collectively for brassieres of different designs. The comfortable clothing pressure of brassieres should be determined in relation to their designs. 4) For strapless brassieres, movement caused a large shift and significantly ruined comfortableness. Rotation of the arms slightly increased pressure at points a and a 2 ̆ 7, and the change in clothing pressure at points b and b 2 ̆ 7 or c and c 2 ̆ 7 tended to be slightly small. The removal of straps may cause changes in the pressure applied to the body...|$|R
