The growth and prosperity of the city, which had originally forced the University's relocation to Hillhead, again proved problematic when more real estate was required. The school of veterinary medicine, which was founded in 1862, moved to a new campus in the leafy surrounds of Garscube Estate, around two miles (3km) west of the main campus, in 1954.

HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to protect our deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science,</b> are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in biology, ecology, biodiversity, oceanography, geology, sedimentology, geophysics and biogeochemistry, who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.|$|E

In the mornings, however, {{for an hour or so}} before I get up, I generally light my candle, and try to write some verses; and since I have been here, I have put together short poems, almost enough for another small volume. In the evenings I have gone on translating some of Goethe. But six or seven hours spent on my legs, in the open air, do not leave my brain much energy for thinking.

Determining the boundary of wetland, whether jurisdictional under sections 404 or 10, or not jurisdictional but still meeting the technical definition of a wetland, that is having the soils, vegetation and hydrology criterion met is called a [...] "wetland delineation", and generally is performed by college graduates <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> or biology degrees working for engineering firms or environmental consulting firms who are familiar with the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland delineation manual.|$|E

50|$|The {{aim of the}} STEM {{mission is}} to {{increase}} the intake of Natural Science and Technology students in higher education. The mission is motivated by the increasing scarcity of people <b>with</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Science</b> Masters and engineers in Denmark - if an intervention isn’t instantiated. The engineer union IDA predicts a shortage of over 13,500 masters by 2025 in Denmark. To solve this problem, it is necessary to map the different choices the future student makes on the road to his or her final education choice. There is a need to determine how the course from kindergarten to the Natural Science university faculty looks like, to be able to identify the situations in which an intervention will have the greatest effect. In the STEM mission, we will identify the especially relevant points in the choice process which will be the focus of following efforts towards getting more people to choose a STEM education track - we do this through psychological insights in human behaviour and decision making.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the term}} (and its {{approximate}} sense) {{can be found}} at least as early as 1840, in John Stuart Mill's 1840 essay on Coleridge, where Mill contrasts the Kantian-influenced thought of [...] "Continental philosophy" [...] and [...] "Continental philosophers" [...] with the English empiricism of Bentham and the 18th century generally. [...] This notion gained prominence in the early 20th century as figures such as Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore advanced a vision of philosophy closely allied <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science,</b> progressing through logical analysis. This tradition, which {{has come to be known}} broadly as [...] "analytic philosophy", became dominant in Britain and the United States from roughly 1930 onward. Russell and Moore made a dismissal of Hegelianism and its philosophical relatives a distinctive part of their new movement. [...] Commenting on the history of the distinction in 1945, Russell distinguished [...] "two schools of philosophy, which may be broadly distinguished as the Continental and the British respectively", a division he saw as operative [...] "from the time of Locke".|$|E
