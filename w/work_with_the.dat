5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this.

All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
