Quite a few are nicely varnished, and in a general way they've hall-marked gold or silver tops. The hallmark, however, guarantees only the trimmings, and from one or two specimens that I've come across I've a suspicion that in some cases the timber's rotten.

50|$|There is {{a legend}} that {{describes}} how {{the building of the}} church came to be. Two sisters from Deventer, Martha and Beatrix, were heavily impressed by a knight who had come to Deventer. Both of them fancied the knight. Beatrix eventually married the knight, leaving Martha behind in solitude. Martha ordered the church to be built in peace with her loneliness, and let one of the two towers become slightly bigger than the other one, since both sisters were of different height too. This should explain the difference in height between the two towers. The tower on the west (on the right hand stand <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>face</b> it) is the biggest one.|$|E

5000|$|The Battle of Kjølberg Bridge (Slaget vid Kjølbergs bro) {{was fought}} 14 August 1814, during the Swedish-Norwegian war of 1814. The Swedish army had {{problems}} repairing the bridge due to constant {{fire from the}} Norwegian side of the river. It was then a small Swedish force of 75 men passed over the river at a hidden point. Once over they waited for reinforcements but none came; but instead the order of attacking the vastly larger Norwegian force. The Colonel response to the attack order have been famous [...] "It is unreasonable to attack with only 75 men <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>face</b> a whole regiment." [...] "But such an order isn't given to me twice. March!" [...] During cheers the Swedes rushed up the hill toward the mansion that was occupied with 600 men. The attack was surprising and decisive. The Norwegians quickly left the stand. This was the last battle fought during the Swedish-Norwegian War. The Convention of Moss, providing a cease fire agreement, was signed that same day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} Pyre {{came out from}} {{prototyping}} several game ideas by Supergiant Games, according to creative director Greg Kasavin, eventually coming {{to the theme of}} [...] "what happens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>face</b> defeat, and have to come back from it the next day, look your friends in the face, look yourself in the mirror, and deal with the consequences of the decisions you made". In trying to devise gameplay around the nature of failure, they came to see the use of sports as a metaphor for combat, featuring non-violent gameplay but consequences of losing. To connect these battles, the developers came onto the use of a narrative idea to have the player guide their party across an overworld, making decisions on where to go based on available resources and timing. They worked through prototyping to adjust how this part of the game would affect the Rites, adjusting the interaction of these two gameplay systems to get an appropriate balance. Kasavin stated they were worried that as some aspects of the game may be confusing, players that were not invested in the game's narrative would not come to appreciate some of these systems, and that if they were providing enough variation in the game to retain the player's interest over time.|$|E

This {{is all the more}} necessary <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>face</b> a mass disaster such as the Tsunami of December 26, 2004. We will explain in this presentation how the DVI Belgian Team, in close collaboration with the other International Teams, proceeded in January 2005, adopting real guidelines, in strict accordance with the Interpol fixed ones. We will review the various stages of our work, paying special attention to the fingerprints, the examination of clothes, jewels and specific objects, but also to the external and internal examinations of the corpses, the odontological and anthropological approaches and the systematic DNA samplings. Both rigour and application of the Interpol international conventions allow such a systematic approach. Only this optimal procedure can guarantee the best identifications of numerous victims.
