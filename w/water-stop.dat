Henry and his partner Nelson Bennett. Kanaskat served as a <b>water-stop</b> for steam-powered trains out of Auburn, as well as a small yard and scale for the NP's Green River Branch northward to Kangley, Washington, Selleck, Washington, and Kerriston, Washington, as well as the large mills located just to the south in Enumclaw, Washington and Buckley, Washington.|$|E
5000|$|Origin of name:Org was {{originally}} called Islen, after Adrian C. Iselin, {{one of the}} directors of the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company. The year was 1872, and no town existed. Iselin consisted of a section house and a <b>water-stop.</b> Steam locomotives consumed enormous quantities of water, and water-stops were established every 8 to 12 miles along any rail route. Iselin was one of these. When the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company built a spur line from Iselin to Sioux Falls in 1876, the name of the site was changed to Sioux Falls Junction. In 1890 the name was changed to Org by W.A. Scott, a general manager of the Chicago & Northwestern Railway, the company that absorbed the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad Company. He considered the railroad junction an ideal location for a town. The significance of the name [...] "Org" [...] remains obscure; it may be derived from [...] "dog". [...] The town was platted in 1899, and a railroad station was built on the Chicago & Northwestern Railway's main St Paul to Sioux City line. [...] Even though Org never became incorporated, a post office was established between 1895-1917.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper classifies {{the tunnel}} frost damages and {{discusses}} their causes, especially {{the causes of}} lining structural damage for freezing and they are classified into two categories: the outer freezing damage and the inner freezing damage of lining. The analysis shows that the former has a {{little effect on the}} structure, but the latter has big threat. For the phenomenon that cracks frequently occur in the tunnel lining of cold regions, some measures to prevent cracks are presented, including reducing adverse constraints in the process of temperature change and preventing large temperature stress. In cold regions, it is unsuitable to adopt back paste-type <b>water-stops</b> to prevent the leakage from lining construction joints, and a good choice is to utilize the buried drainage <b>water-stops.</b> The ring drainage pipes directly connect with the central drainage pipe, and thermal insulating layer with belt shape is set along the ring drainage pipes in some sections where surrounding rock is water-rich and the middle and lower part of the ring drainage pipe are easily frozen. In sections with high potential freezing threat, an anti-freezing plan is offered that electric heating wires are installed behind the lining wall. The test shows that above techniques have good effects in cold region tunnels...|$|R

To keep pace with safety improvements, the locomotive was fitted with standard Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS), and the Society also completed its Water Wagon project for mainline trials. This will enable mainline <b>water-stops</b> to be avoided on certain routes. No. 6024 returned to the mainline on 7 October 2004, on its third 7-year main line certificate.|$|R
5000|$|According to Steam{{locomotive}}.com, By the mid-1800s, most {{steam locomotive}} tenders {{consisted of a}} fuel bunker (that held coal or wood) surrounded by a [...] "U" [...] shaped (when viewed from the top) water jacket. The overall shape of the tender was usually rectangular. The bunker which held the coal was sloped downwards toward the locomotive providing easier access to the coal. The ratio of water to fuel capacities of tenders was normally based on two <b>water-stops</b> to each fuel stop because water was more readily available than fuel. One pound of coal could turn six pounds of water (0.7 gallons) to steam. Therefore, tender capacity ratios were normally close to 14 tons of coal per 10,000 gallons of water.|$|R

Following the conclusion of the 1977-1978 Ogaden War, Dikhil, along with Ali Sabieh, accommodated three quarters of the 8,000 Issas who had fled from Ethiopia. In 1979, the first President of independent Djibouti Hassan Gouled Aptidon in Dikhil the party founded the People's Rally for Progress, which has since dominated the politics of Djibouti.|$|E
40|$|Key word: Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge; {{precast pile}} cap; <b>water-stop</b> system; system {{selection}} Abstract. Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZM Bridge) {{is located in}} the LingDing Sea area outside the Pearl River estuary, where the hydrological and meteorological are very complex. Because the effective operating time was short and environmental protection requirements were high, the bridge construction is very difficult. For this feature, the method of non-navigable pier construction was used factory prefabrication and on-site installation. Unlike the traditional way of the bridge pier construction, this method can greatly shorten the time to operations at sea, by which all piers will be prefabricated in the factory and these will be only installed at the on-site. The construction of water stop between precast cap and steel pipe pile is the key aspects, and also one of the main focuses. This article introduces the <b>water-stop</b> system selection, design and test etc. three aspects...|$|E
40|$|The asphalt core {{itself is}} a no-joint water barrier in {{embankment}} dams and {{is connected to the}} concrete plinth {{on the bottom of the}} core. A reliable asphalt core-plinth connection is crucial and must remain watertight when the core deforms due to deformations in the embankment and foundation and due to reservoir water pressure. A large number of tension tests were conducted to determine the best ratios, joint thickness and suitable additives for the sandy asphalt mastic (SAM) mix used for the connection. With the ratios of bitumen to filler to sand of 20 %: 35 %: 45 % and by adding 4 % SBS in the bitumen, one got a very suitable composition for the asphalt core-plinth connection in tensile conditions. Model tests were conducted to study the connection behavior when subjected to large shear displacements and high water pressure. The joint model test results indicate that the plane-surface plinth, curved-surface plinth, and plinth with or without copper <b>water-stop</b> showed no significant difference for the connection in the joint shear behavior. However, plinth with copper <b>water-stop</b> is suggested to enhance its tensile and shear behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Water-bearing {{fault of}} subsea tunnel has fissure water developed, {{fractured}} surrounding rock with low strength, which gets {{a risk of}} sudden water inflow and affects the tunnel security. This paper takes the geological forecast and treatment for water-bearing fault of the Qingdao kiaochow bay subsea tunnel for example, according to the water assignment characteristics, using the detect method of TEM and advance borehole to make accurate decision for the position of water-bearing body, the scale of fracture zone and the inflow of water. Through the analysis of results, the grouting form, materials and parameters are chosen and adjusted. The grouting material seals the water flowing fracture, forming <b>water-stopping</b> curtain outside tunnel excavation contour line and strengthening the fault fracture zone to improve the stability of rock...|$|R

Unfortunately some experts believe that water loss during winter and out of the crop season is the main disadvantage of this method. One of the methods to increase the discharge of kariz, is to recharge the aquifer artificially, where the karez tunnels are dug in them. This can be done by different methods, which are divided by "surface recharge " method and "underground recharge " method. Some case studies of Iran will be considered in the paper.
