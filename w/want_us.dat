25|$|Vallée also {{proposes that}} a {{secondary}} {{aspect of the}} UFO phenomenon involves human manipulation by humans. Witnesses of UFO phenomena undergo a manipulative and staged spectacle, meant to alter their belief system, and eventually, influence human society by suggesting alien intervention from outer space. The ultimate motivation for this deception is probably a projected major change of human society, the breaking down of old belief systems and the implementation of new ones. Vallée states that the evidence, if carefully analyzed, suggests an underlying plan for the deception of mankind by means of unknown, highly advanced methods. Vallée states that {{it is highly unlikely}} that governments actually conceal alien evidence, as the popular myth suggests. Rather, it is much more likely that that is exactly what the manipulators <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to believe. Vallée feels the entire subject of UFOs is mystified by charlatans and science fiction. He advocates a stronger and more serious involvement of science in the UFO research and debate. Only this can reveal the true nature of the UFO phenomenon.|$|E

[...] Timothy Cleveland, the Head of the Philosophy Department at New Mexico State University, wrote that the opening lyric was an introspection of the self. He noted [...] "here feeling is contrasted with perceptual states that make one aware of the world around them. The 'enemy' that one can feel is oneself. 'To feel' in this case refers to a kind of awareness one has of oneself independent of the sensations of the outside world... Like perceptual feeling it is a kind of direct awareness and so a kind of knowledge by acquaintance." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks <b>want</b> <b>us</b> out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..."

500|$|On the contrary, Girlschool's {{change of}} musical style in 1984 and their sudden predilection for the US market were not well {{received}} by the British press and by their fans at home. The change of attitude and image, exemplified by the music video for [...] "Running Wild" [...] on rotation on MTV, which showed the girls playing with heavy make-up, combed hair and fancy costumes, imitating a trendy American glam outfit, alienated the love of British fans, whose perception of the band was still that of roughneck companions to Motörhead, instead of competitors of Mötley Crüe and Ratt. In the time span of two years, Girlschool passed from headliner act to having serious difficulty to find a gig in the UK: [...] "Nobody seems to <b>want</b> <b>us</b> in Britain anymore", confessed McAuliffe to journalist Malcolm Dome in 1984. The return of Girlschool {{to the sound of}} their beginnings came too late to win back the large fan base of their heyday and the band fell to cult status already in the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} {{marijuana is}} prominently featured in the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of {{a scene in which}} Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since {{they did not want to}} instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't <b>want</b> <b>us</b> glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like we usually do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received.

With the inflation in costs {{brought on by the}} foundation of the FA Premier League in 1992, the club soon began to lose money heavily. Rumours that the groundshare would eventually result in the Dons and the Eagles merging led Hammam to say [...] "I’d rather die and have vultures eat my insides than merge with Crystal Palace". In 1992 the Greyhound Racing Association offered to redevelop Wimbledon Stadium (less than a mile from Plough Lane) into a 15,000-seater dog racing and football ground. Hammam was outraged two years later when the council, attempting to retain the Plough Lane site for public use, refused to sanction its sale for a supermarket redevelopment that Hammam said would finance a new ground at the dog racing site. Hammam angrily declared he would look elsewhere, and threatened to change the club's name and remove the double-headed eagle device, a symbol of Wimbledon Borough, from the team's badge.
