5|$|McCain <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>prisoner</b> {{of war in}} North Vietnam {{for five}} and a half years until his release on March 14, 1973. His wartime {{injuries}} left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.|$|E

McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. The wounds that he sustained during war have left him with lifelong physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|On March 30, 1780, Scott {{arrived in}} Charleston just as Clinton was laying siege to the city.

Although he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>prisoner,</b> he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November 13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point.

5|$|Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and {{his group}} were stopped by TNI {{soldiers}} belonging to 102Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman– who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them– <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>prisoner,</b> refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent {{to pick up the}} general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>prisoner</b> in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
