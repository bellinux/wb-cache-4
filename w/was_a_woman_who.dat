25|$|Fujiyama {{inadvertently}} attracted {{attention in}} 2000 after an article {{was published in}} the journal Neurology. The article discussed the possible relationship between riding roller coasters and the occurrence of subdural hematomas. The primary case study cited by the authors <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had reported severe headaches after riding several roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland (including Fujiyama). Upon investigation, it was discovered that this woman did in fact have a subdural hematoma. Subsequent research, however, has maintained that this risk remains low and is not unique to this particular coaster.|$|E

25|$|Elmhurst Christian Reformed Church is a {{congregation}} of the Christian Reformed Church in North America {{located on the}} southern edge of Elmhurst, Illinois.

After moving to Elmhurst in 1964, the congregation flourished and constructed a large new building just off of Roosevelt Road.

25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If a baby is expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E
25|$|Gerard may be {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} botany in English language, but he was not well educated, was more interested as a herbalist and barber-surgeon in the medicinal properties of the plants than botanical theory and was not notable as a botanist in terms of technical knowledge in his own time according to his critics. Amongst these was John Ray, who commented that despite the fact that the book was the standard botany text in the seventeenth century, it was the work of an ignorant man, and that lacking any foreign languages he could not have translated the work. Because it was a practical and useful book, packed with helpful drawings of plants, and because Gerard had a fluid and lively writing manner, his Herball was popular with ordinary literate people in 17th-century England. Although it was recognised amongst scholars that it was a pirated work, with many limitations, at that time there is evidence of the book still being in practical use as a medicinal herbal, even in the early 19th century. Agnes Arber recounts a story of a man born in 1842 that in his childhood there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> used the Herball for treating the ailments of her neighbours.|$|E

She became widely celebrated {{for her work}} as the film editor on Spielberg's next film, Jaws (1975), for which she won both the Academy Award for Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in 1976. Leonard Maltin has {{characterized}} her editing as [...] "sensational". Gerald Peary, who interviewed Fields in 1980, wrote that, [...] "Jaws scared the world, brought in a fortune for Universal, and made Verna Fields, who won an Academy Award, about as famous 'overnight' as an editor ever gets." [...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven {{told me it was}} because I had cut the first picture that was a monumental success in which you can really see the editing.

500|$|According to her biographer Julia Philips, Montalban {{had been}} {{described}} by her magical students as [...] "tempestuous, generous, humorous, demanding, kind, capricious, talented, volatile, selfish, goodhearted, [...] dramatic". Philips noted that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> made a [...] "definite impression" [...] in all those whom she encountered, but who equally could be quite shy and disliked being interviewed in anything other than print. Philips asserted that Montalban had a [...] "mercurial personality" [...] and could be kind and generous at one moment and fly into a violent temper the next. Several of her friends noted that she was prudish {{when it came to}} sexual matters, and her friend Maxine Sanders stated that even as an elderly lady Montalban boasted of only taking men under the age of twenty-five as her lovers. She would take great pleasure in causing arguments, particularly between a couple who were romantically involved.|$|E
500|$|Although Boston {{suggested}} that Gibbons's rating [...] {{in the academic}} English Literature world ought to be high, her literary status is indeterminate. She did not promote herself, and was indifferent to the attractions of public life: [...] "I'm not shy", she told Oliver, [...] "I'm just unsociable". [...] Truss records that Gibbons had [...] "overtly rejected the literary world... she didn't move in literary circles, or even visit literary squares, or love in literary triangles". Truss [...] posits further reasons why Gibbons did not become a [...] literary canon. Because she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> wrote amusingly, she was classified as [...] "middlebrow"; furthermore, she was published by Longmans, a non-literary publisher. Her lampooning of the literary establishment in the spoof dedication of [...] Cold Comfort Farm to one [...] "Anthony Pookworthy" [...] did not amuse that establishment, who were further offended by the book's mockery of the writing of such canonical figures as Lawrence and Hardy—hence Virginia Woolf's reaction to the Prix Étranger award. Her belief in what she called [...] "the gentle powers (Pity, Affection, Time, Beauty, Laughter)" [...] also flew {{in the face of}} a disillusioned modernism.|$|E

2500|$|Bernadette Peters' {{take on the}} {{character}} was different: [...] "Rose <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in 'Rose's Turn', she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her...and that destroys Rose. There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother." ...|$|E

Near Bedford, approximately 500 vehicles became stuck along a westbound stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike for over 24 hours from January 22–23 near the eastern approach to the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Among the stranded vehicles were one bus carrying the Duquesne University men's basketball team and another carrying Temple University's women's gymnastics team. Despite {{the scale of the}} incident, no major injuries were reported. The band Guster, stranded in Pittsburgh by the blocking of the turnpike, held an impromptu concert in an alley. Four people died while shoveling snow: two in both Lancaster and Montgomery counties. One of the dead in Montgomery County <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was 8-months pregnant; the baby was declared dead on-scene when paramedics arrived.

Webster called a friend in Australia, and were able to arrange an audition with Torv, who was camping in the Outback at the time she received the call from her agent. Torv read for a few scenes over the Internet, and was told the following day that she had won the role, embarking for Toronto soon after to begin shooting.
