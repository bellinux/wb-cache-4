500|$|With Lane's support, the nation's railroads voluntarily {{united to}} form a Railroad War Board to meet the emergency. Lane made many {{effective}} speeches for the Committee on Public Information. The Secretary penned two brief works for the Committee, Why <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Fighting</b> Germany and The American Spirit, which were well received and widely distributed. He urged businessmen to make [...] "sacrifices as worthy {{as those of the}} men {{on their way to the}} trenches". President Wilson reportedly stopped discussing matters of importance at Cabinet meetings because the [...] "gregarious" [...] Lane divulged confidential matters.|$|E

5000|$|Creator Frank Hampson stated [...] "Basically <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> the Second World War again - the Treens {{were the}} Nazis".|$|R
60|$|I was {{naturally}} {{anxious to}} be instructed in the Italian theory, hoping {{it might be}} profounder than the English notion that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> about tariffs.|$|R
500|$|At {{the height}} of the battle Tang Shengzhi complained to Chiang that, [...] "Our {{casualties}} are naturally heavy and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> against metal with merely flesh and blood", but what the Chinese lacked in equipment they made up for in the sheer ferocity with which they fought, though this was partially due to strict orders that no man or unit was to retreat one step without permission. Over the course of the battle roughly 1,000 Chinese soldiers were shot dead by other members of their own army for attempting to retreat, and on Yuhuatai Japanese soldiers noticed that many Chinese pillboxes were chained from the outside to prevent their occupants from fleeing.|$|E
500|$|Upset by German {{participation}} in the crusade, the Obotrites [...] preemptively invaded Wagria in Holstein in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at Dobin and the Liutizian fort at Demmin. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes Canute V and Sweyn III, Adalbert II, Archbishop of Bremen and Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, [...] "Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> our people?" [...] The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, Niklot, agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo baptism.|$|E
2500|$|Contra leader Adolfo Calero {{denied that}} his forces {{deliberately}} targeted civilians: [...] "What {{they call a}} cooperative is also a troop concentration full of armed people. We are not killing civilians. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> armed people and returning fire when fire is directed at us." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{was also}} accused by Crystal Palace chairman, Simon Jordan in November 2005, of [...] "taking the team out {{and getting them}} wasted when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> relegation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili, said, [...] "it's time to {{move from}} words to action {{because this is not}} going to go away.

5000|$|Custer is {{mentioned}} in the game Turok; when Turok finishes a flashback about using a compound bow, Slade responds, [...] "That {{would be a great}} weapon, if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> Colonel Custer".|$|R
2500|$|Thiệu bemoaned the American funding cuts, {{which he}} equated to desertion, saying, [...] "You don't fight by miracles, you need high morale and bravery. But {{even if you}} are brave, you can’t just stand there and bite the enemy. And <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> against Russia and China. We’re having to bargain for aid from the United States like haggling for fish in the market and I am not going to {{continue}} this bargaining for a few million dollars when your [...] lives are at stake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morris {{called the}} Israel–Palestinian {{conflict}} a facet {{of a global}} clash of civilizations between Islam and the Western World in the Haaretz interview, saying, [...] "There is a deep problem in Islam. It's a world whose values are different. A world in which human life doesn't have the same value {{as it does in}} the West, in which freedom, democracy, openness and creativity are alien...Revenge plays a central part in the Arab tribal culture. Therefore, the people <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> and the society that sends them have no moral inhibitions." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{offshoot}} of the FLEC claimed responsibility. Rodrigues Mingas, {{secretary general of the}} Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (Flec-PM), said his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. [...] "This attack was not aimed at the Togolese players but at the Angolan forces {{at the head of the}} convoy", Mingas told France24 television. [...] "So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don't have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> for the total liberation of Cabinda." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Already, our {{cries of}} victory were raised. An hour more, {{and not a}} Spaniard would have {{remained}} on foot. Just at this time my command had been ordered up, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in the front rank.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] began MacIan, again blunderingly, [...] "this gentleman {{wrote in}} his {{newspaper}} that Our Lady was a common woman, a bad woman, and so we agreed to fight; and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> quite a little time ago--but that <b>was</b> before <b>we</b> saw you." ...|$|R
60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in {{the thicket}} the other flat-boats {{had come down}} the stream, rounded-to, and made fast {{alongside}} the first craft; but not a man had gone on shore {{to take part in}} the battle because of the orders left by our leader.|$|R
2500|$|The {{litigation}} group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their {{suit against}} Chisso in the Kumamoto District Court on 14 June 1969. The {{leader of the}} group, Eizō Watanabe (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, [...] "Today, and from this day forth, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> against {{the power of the}} state." [...] Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was ignored, her family's fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown at her in the street.|$|E
2500|$|Danish {{parliamentary}} speaker Mogens Lykketoft {{was chosen}} as the consensus candidate of WEOG to preside over the assembly. His goals were formulating a Post-2015 Development Agenda as [...] "sustainable development goals," [...] in particular environmental sustainability. He said [...] "Things have changed in the past 15 years. We are no longer just fighting extreme poverty brought about by a lack of public services. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> against a new form of poverty, one caused by the unsustainable path of development that we, as a species, have chosen to embark on. The consensus is {{that it is impossible to}} continue without endangering not just ourselves, but future generations as well." [...] Amongst these goals included the end of year United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP21.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "story" [...] of Champagne {{wine was}} {{gradually}} re-told, effectively suppressing outdated and unfashionable ideas and images and promoting more desirable ones. This served {{not only the}} interests of Champagne négociants but the French nation as a whole; by the first World War, Champagne had become a prominent and powerful symbol of the nation's status as a producer of quality goods in general, and vanguard of style and culture worldwide. It became, in effect, a major symbol of France. During World War II, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, once motivated the British forces with the claim [...] "Remember, gentlemen, it's not just France <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> for, it's Champagne!" [...] The British had been particularly hard hit by interruptions in trade during both World Wars.|$|E
60|$|It is {{too much}} to suppose that the combatants will ever drop the obvious old bone. But it is not too much to imagine that some men might {{acknowledge}} the bone to be merely a pretext, and hollow casus belli. If we really could know what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for, if <b>we</b> if we could deeply believe in what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for, then the struggle might have dignity, beauty, satisfaction for us. If it were a profound struggle for something that was coming to life in us, a struggle that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> convinced would bring us to a new freedom, a new life, then it would be a creative activity, a creative activity in which death is a climax in the progression towards new being. And this is tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|MRS MARCH. And no {{business}} to meddle with practical affairs. You {{and he always}} ride {{in front of the}} hounds. Do you remember when the war broke out, how angry you were with me because I said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> from a sense of self-preservation? Well, weren't we? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, your honor! Here have <b>we</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> all day, and not {{a blessed}} thing to eat or to drink. No one knows what became of the wagons; and here <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> without {{as much as a}} biscuit to ate--and in such weather as this, too; and another battle in the morning." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 1 September 2006, a {{day after}} 22 {{commercial}} banks were simultaneously bombed in Yala Province, Sonthi {{announced that he would}} break with the government's no-negotiation policy. However, he noted that [...] "We still don't know who is the real head of the militants <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> with." [...] In a press conference the next day, he attacked the government for criticising him for trying to negotiate with the anonymous insurgents, and demanded that the government [...] "Free the military and let it do the job." [...] His confrontation with the government made his call for negotiation extremely popular with the media. Afterwards, insurgents bombed six department stores in Hat Yai city, which until then had been free of insurgent activities. The identity of the insurgents was not revealed. Sonthi was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat unrest in the far south. By 19 September 2006 (after Sonthi overthrew the Thai government), the army admitted that it was still unsure who to negotiate with.|$|E
2500|$|Even during World War I, {{the phrase}} met {{with some degree}} of skepticism; the British {{politician}} David Lloyd George is reputed to have said, [...] "This war, like the next war, is a war to end war." [...] As it became apparent that the war had not succeeded in ending war, the phrase took on a more cynical tone. The British staff officer Archibald Wavell, a future field marshal and viceroy of India, said despondently of the Paris Peace Conference, [...] "After the 'war to end war', they seem to have been in Paris at making the 'Peace to end Peace'." [...] Wells himself used the phrase in an ironic way in the novel The Bulpington of Blup (1932). Walter Lippmann wrote in Newsweek in 1967, [...] "The delusion is that whatever war <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> is the war to end war", while President Richard Nixon, in his [...] "Silent Majority" [...] speech, said, [...] "I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars".|$|E
2500|$|In Gambia, President Yahya Jammeh has led {{the call}} for {{legislation}} that would set laws against homosexuals that would be [...] "stricter than those in Iran", {{and that he would}} [...] "cut off the head" [...] of any gay or lesbian person discovered in the country. News reports indicated his government intended to execute all homosexuals in the country. In the speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a [...] "final ultimatum" [...] to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said that [...] "omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers", and that those who do so [...] "want {{to put an end to}} human existence". In 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals [...] "vermins" [...] by saying that [...] "We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively". He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that [...] "As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis; all of which are detrimental to human existence". In 2015, in defiance of western criticism Jammeh intensified his anti-gay rhetoric, telling a crowd during an agricultural tour: [...] "If you do it [...] I will slit your throat—if you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{flesh is}} weak. Good or evil purpose, Humanity {{has to pay}} the price. Why! In that very fight for that little village of which I have <b>been</b> telling you <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for the shelter of those old houses as much as victory. And with the French it was the same.|$|R
5000|$|Brothers in Arms was {{the first}} album to sell one million copies in the CD format and to outsell its LP version. A Rykodisc {{employee}} would subsequently write, [...] "1985 <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> to get our CDs manufactured because the entire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for a single rock title (Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms)." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't throw {{cold water}} upon my compromise," [...] Mr. Foley begged. [...] "We {{are hoping for}} great things. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> the class against which you have written so splendidly; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>fighting</b> the bourgeoisie, tooth and nail. One thing is {{certainly}} written--that if Maraton here stands by my side {{for the next seven}} years, Labour will have thrown off one, at least, of the shackles that bind her. Isn't it better to release her slowly and gradually, than to destroy her altogether by trying more violent means?" ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} his life, {{remembering his}} part in the Spanish American War, Turner was heard to say, “They gave us the Springfield rifle. I wish I had never learned to shoot it. They said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for liberty, but it was cruel, it was cruel.” [...] He died in Corning at age 92 and is buried there in Walnut Grove Cemetery.|$|R
6000|$|What have <b>we</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> for? What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>fighting</b> for? Do you [...] know? Does any one know? Why am I {{spending}} {{what is left}} of my [...] {{substance and}} you {{what is left of}} yours to keep on this war against [...] each other? What have we to gain from hurting one another still [...] further? Why should <b>we</b> <b>be</b> puppets any longer in the hands of crowned [...] fools and witless diplomatists? Even if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dumb and acquiescent [...] before, does not the blood of our sons now cry out to us that this [...] foolery should cease? We have let these people send our sons to [...] death.|$|R
6000|$|Colonel Woodburn frowned a little, {{and passed}} over the joke. [...] "I think Mr. Lindau is right. Such {{exhibitions}} were common to both sides, though if you gentlemen will pardon me for saying so, I think they were less frequent on ours. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> more immediately for existence. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> fewer than you <b>were,</b> and <b>we</b> knew it; we felt more intensely that if each were not for all, then none was for any." ...|$|R
