60|$|Soames {{raised the}} corner of his lip in a smile, and looked across at Bosinney. The {{architect}} <b>was</b> <b>grinning</b> behind the fumes of his cigarette. Now, indeed, he looked more like a buccaneer.|$|E

60|$|Number Ten <b>was</b> <b>grinning</b> broadly, while Number Three {{advanced}} cautiously {{toward one}} of the creatures, making a low guttural noise, that could only be interpreted as peaceful and conciliatory--more like a feline purr it was than anything else.|$|E
6000|$|A {{short time}} after she pursued--"I seed {{you go out}} with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" [...] and she basted away. John, when I turned to him, <b>was</b> <b>grinning</b> from ear to ear.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the very}} next morning that Unc' Billy Possum was {{trotting}} along the Crooked Little Path down the hill. He was just starting out on his daily round of calls, and he <b>was</b> <b>grinning</b> as only Unc' Billy Possum can grin.|$|E

60|$|Ralph {{never forgot}} that dance. Miss Regan danced with amazing sprightliness, {{performing}} wonderful steps.

6000|$|What can we {{wish for}} more? [...] Thanks to the frost and flood [...] We <b>are</b> <b>grinning</b> crones--thin bags of bones [...] Who once were flesh and blood.

6000|$|... "Oh, he didn't really pitch. He just humped {{up a few}} times," [...] replied Flo, {{and then}} when she saw how Carley {{was going to take}} it she burst into a merry peal of laughter.

60|$|However, {{knowing that}} he was quick as a weasel and silent as a cat, we let him go.

60|$|She was {{trembling}} in every fibre. A big, sullen boy, not bad but very difficult, slouched {{out to the}} front.

And she was afraid.|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been {{observed}} that Thorward's face expressed some unusual symptoms of feeling, as he looked up the river, and saw there nothing but a turbulent mass of heaving surges dashing themselves wildly against sharp forbidding rocks, which at one moment <b>were</b> <b>grinning</b> like black teeth amidst the white foam, and the next were overwhelmed by the swelling billows.|$|R

6000|$|But to Mr. Pynsent the {{transaction}} appeared perfectly simple--there {{was no reason}} present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded, {{as well as at}} any other hour; and he asked of Mr. Wagg, when they went away, [...] "What the devil he <b>was</b> <b>grinning</b> and winking at, and what amused him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{found herself}} handed {{out of the}} room, with {{somewhat}} curtailed good nights, although nine o'clock, her usual signal, had not yet struck.
