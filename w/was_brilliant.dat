After breaking even in 2010 and going 6–12 in 2011, the Argonauts again acquired a championship nucleus in 2012. Ricky Ray <b>was</b> <b>brilliant</b> at quarterback while Chad Owens emerged as arguably the league's best special teams player. Owens broke Michael Clemons CFL record for all purpose yards {{and won the}} CFL Most Outstanding Player award that year. The 2012 Grey Cup was played in Toronto and the team took their first championship victory in the city since 1952, a 35–22 win over Calgary.|$|E

25|$|Speculation in {{the media}} that Sunline would be {{vulnerable}} in the Cox Plate - in open company over 2,040 metres - proved unfounded. She <b>was</b> <b>brilliant.</b> Leading before the home turn, Sunline easily held off a late challenge from Tie the Knot, with Caulfield Cup winner Sky Heights in third place. Sunline became only the fifth mare to win the race {{since its inception in}} 1922, and the second of four mares to have won the race since Dane Ripper in 1997 (the others being Makybe Diva in 2005 and Pinker Pinker in 2011).|$|E
25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he {{was always}} for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was {{a master of the}} art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he <b>was</b> <b>brilliant</b> in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 18 for another {{series with the}} Diamondbacks. They lost {{the first game of}} the series 4–2 in 12 innings. This was the third straight home extra innings game, matching the longest streak at Dodger Stadium (the last of which was in 1982 against the Braves). A three-run homer by Andre Ethier paced the team the next day as they won 8–6. Puig hit a 3-run homer in a 4–1 win in the series finale. Cliff Lee dominated the Dodgers 7–0 as the Philadelphia Phillies came to town next. A costly error in the 10th inning led to a 3–2 loss the next night. Greinke picked up his 4th win while striking out 11 in seven-plus innings on April 23. Puig tripled and Hanley Ramírez hit a homer and double to pace the offense in the 5–2 win over the Phillies. Brian Wilson allowed four runs in the ninth inning as the Phillies took the final game of the series, 7–3. Josh Beckett <b>was</b> <b>brilliant</b> on April 25 against the Colorado Rockies, striking out six and allowing only two runs in eight innings. However, the Dodgers dropped another extra innings contest, 5–4. Kemp and Gonzalez both homered in the Dodgers 6–3 the next day. Ryu was pounded in the final game of the homestand and the Dodgers lost to the Rockies 6–1.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers next began a key {{road trip}} against {{the two teams}} with the best records in the National League, the Washington Nationals and Cincinnati Reds. The opener of their series against the Nationals was rained out, forcing them to play a double-header on September 19. In the first game, the bats {{continued}} to be non-existent as they lost 3-1. In the second game, Josh Beckett <b>was</b> <b>brilliant</b> for 7 innings as they Dodgers built a 6-0 lead, only to see the bullpen falter in the 8th and the Nationals tied the game. Matt Kemp homered {{in the top of}} the ninth to provide the crucial run in the 7-6 victory. They closed out the series the next day with a 4-1 loss, dimming their post-season hopes. The Dodgers beat the Reds on September 21, thanks to a 2 RBI single by Kemp {{in the top of the}} 10th inning. Mat Latos shut down the Dodgers the next day, for a 6-0 Reds victory. Clayton Kershaw made the start on September 23, his first start since in 12 days since suffering a hip injury. Kershaw allowed only one run in 5 innings and Adrian Gonzalez hit two home runs, to lead the Dodgers to a 5-3 victory over the Reds. The Dodgers, with their season hanging by a thread, next traveled to San Diego for a series with the Padres. They dropped the first game of the series 2-1. Kemp had four hits, including a home run the next night as the Dodgers offense finally showed some life and they beat the Padres 8-2. The Dodgers finished off their last road trip of the season with an 8-4 victory over the Padres, with both A.J. Ellis and Luis Cruz driving in 2 runs in the game.|$|E

500|$|The playwright Tom Stoppard {{approached}} Hordern in 1971 {{with a view}} to {{him playing}} a leading part in the playwright's new play Jumpers, a comic satire based around the field of academic philosophy. [...] Hordern was to play George Moore, a bumbling old philosophy professor, who is employed at a modern university and who, throughout the play, is in constant debate with himself over his moral values. Hordern, though thinking the play <b>was</b> <b>brilliant,</b> disliked the script on the initial read-through as he did not understand its complex situations and strange dialogue. His co-star would be Diana Rigg, who played Moore's wife Dotty, and the entire piece was to be directed by Peter Wood.|$|E
500|$|Many of Waugh's {{friends and}} admirers gave the book unstinting praise, among them Rebecca West, Lady Diana Cooper, Desmond MacCarthy and Hilaire Belloc. Among those less {{enthusiastic}} were the novelist J.B.

The novel's critical standing grew steadily {{in the years following}} its publication. In 1942 the American critic Alexander Woollcott chose it as the best English novel in 100 years, a verdict largely endorsed some years later by Frank Kermode. Sykes wrote in 1975 that [...] "there are only five or six novels of this century that can seriously challenge it".|$|E
