5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, <b>whose</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court.

Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, a move that would allow compensation claims to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys <b>whose</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a passenger, for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination.

Some of the outbuildings were left standing and are private property still known as Atherton Hall. This portion of Atherton was incorporated into Leigh in 1894 and the area became a public park.|$|E
