5|$|Meanwhile, Sophie's {{country is}} {{caught up in}} a war with a {{neighboring}} country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch.|$|E

25|$|Soy {{beans and}} quinoa {{are known as}} {{complete}} proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements.

25|$|Covered {{entities}} that out-source {{some of their}} business processes to a third party must ensure that their vendors also have a framework in place to comply with HIPAA requirements. Companies typically gain this assurance through clauses in the contracts stating that the vendor <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> same data protection requirements that apply to the covered entity. Care {{must be taken to}} determine if the vendor further out-sources any data handling functions to other vendors and monitor whether appropriate contracts and controls are in place.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{characteristic}} social phobia features, {{a range of}} other anxiety symptoms are very commonly associated with FXS, with symptoms typically spanning a number of psychiatric diagnoses but not fulfilling any of the criteria in full. Behaviors such as hand flapping and biting, as well as aggression, can be an expression of anxiety. Although only a minority <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> criteria for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), a significant majority will feature obsessive-type symptoms. However, as individuals with FXS generally find these behaviors pleasurable, unlike individuals with OCD, they are more frequently referred to as stereotypic behaviors.|$|E
25|$|The Engineering Group {{seeks out}} new {{technology}} and designs for instrumentation that can work more efficiently, be more accurate, and or be produced {{at a lower cost}} than existing instrumentation. HIF works directly with vendors to help them produce products that <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> mission needs of the USGS. For instrument needs not currently met by a vendor, the Engineering Group designs, tests, and issues contracts to have HIF designed equipment made. Sometimes HIF will patent a new design in the hope that instrument vendors will buy the rights and mass-produce the instrument at a lower cost to everyone.|$|E

25|$|Slightly-modified human wastes are {{pumped into}} the river downriver of several towns. Hamilton city {{has one of the}} most modern water {{treatment}} systems in the world following a 2003 report by GHB water consultants. In 2007 $22 million was spent upgrading the existing intake station south of the city at Riverlea. This <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> cities demand until 2016. Waste water in its untreated state is 99.9% water and 0.1% other matter. A series of sophisticated machines produce clean water of a high standard getting rid of bad tastes odours and toxins to meet the upgraded NZ water standards. The Pukete 2 project which started in 2002 will upgrade the plant in a series of stages costing $24 million.|$|E

500|$|Almost unanimously, {{the army}} applauded the Night of the Long Knives, {{even though the}} generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. The ailing President Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered {{military}} hero, sent a telegram expressing his [...] "profoundly felt gratitude" [...] and he congratulated Hitler for [...] "nipping treason in the bud". General von Reichenau {{went so far as}} to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Ernst Röhm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. François-Poncet was not declared persona non grata as would have been usual if an Ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government. The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realise this: [...] "if you look on without lifting a finger," [...] he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, [...] "you <b>will</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> same fate sooner or later." [...] Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.|$|E
