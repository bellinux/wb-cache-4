Theben Castle <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> by Napoleon's French troops during an {{invasion}} of 1809. In 1825 the Hungarian National Learned Society (the present Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was founded in Pressburg using a donation from István Széchenyi.

5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and window of the front wall were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the building <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> and without its front wall by 1723.|$|E

Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop <b>was</b> <b>ruined.</b> Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E

Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews.

5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted.

5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Grace was {{inactive}} {{for over}} a week after that match, partly because of his injury but also as his daughter was born in London, and his next appearance was in Ireland where he played for the USEE against 15 past and present players of the University of Dublin at its College Park venue. This match was played over three days, starting on Thursday, 23 May. A guest player in the USEE team was the Australian batsman Charles Bannerman. However, Grace and Bannerman scored just 11 and 1 respectively in the USEE first innings, while Fred Grace and Bannerman's fellow Australian Midwinter scored 46 and 64.

5|$|In 1685 Siam {{attempted}} to cede Singora to France: the {{hope was that}} the French East India Company, supported by a garrison of troops, could rebuild the city, establish a trading post and counter the strong regional Dutch influence. The city was offered to France's envoy to Siam, the Chevalier de Chaumont, and a provisional treaty signed in December; Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan sailed to France the following year to ratify the cession. The French, however, were not interested: Secretary of State for the Navy, the Marquis de Seignelay, told Kosa Pan that Singora <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> and of no further use, {{and asked for a}} trading post in Bangkok instead.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves on the trees were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy <b>was</b> <b>ruined,</b> with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to verdicts by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E

He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career <b>was</b> <b>ruined.</b>|$|E
5|$|Director Masahiro Sakurai first {{announced}} that a new Super Smash Bros. game was planned for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U at E3 2011 in June 2011, but development only officially began following the completion of Sakurai's other project, , in March 2012. The game was later revealed to be a joint-project between Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Games, with various staff members from Bandai Namco's Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development. Sakurai, who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series' multiple fighters, has involved more staff to further improve the game's competitive balance. The game was officially revealed at E3 2013 on June 11, 2013 during a Nintendo Direct presentation. Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game's official website and Miiverse community, various cinematic trailers were released, introducing each of the brand new fighters. Sakurai chose to use these trailers, which benefit from Internet sharing, as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl, as he believed the impact of seeing the mode's cinematic cutscenes {{for the first time}} <b>was</b> <b>ruined</b> by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites.|$|E
5|$|In July 1545, the French {{carried out}} a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet. Soon, however, silt began to block the {{entrance}} to the Camber, threatening its use as an anchorage. Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and the authorities in Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the Camber was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage <b>was</b> <b>ruined.</b> The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E
