5|$|At 2:00 Polish {{observation}} posts on the Holy Trinity Church and the Astronomical Observatory at Ujazdów Avenue spotted enemy {{movements and}} sounded the alarm. The attack started around 4:00, and <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> Polish forts 54 and 57 {{opened fire on}} approaching Russians. Around 5:00, eighty-six guns of the I Infantry Corps started shelling Polish positions around Wola {{from a distance of}} , and the battle started.|$|E
5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed. <b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with {{an unknown number of}} German sailors killed on the sunken ships. An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors {{and a loss of}} electrical power throughout the ship. <b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> the ship's main generators were restarted and it was able to resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the aft harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E

5|$|By {{now it was}} mid-August, {{more than}} three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho, a small steam tug that had {{assisted}} Emma during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
5|$|Dazed {{survivors}} immediately {{feared that}} the explosion {{was the result of}} a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city's hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, Bismarck {{received}} {{the order to}} steam to Kiel. On the way, the ship was escorted by several Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters {{and a pair of}} armed merchant vessels, along with an icebreaker. At 08:45 on 8 March, Bismarck briefly ran aground on the southern shore of the Kiel Canal; she was freed <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> The ship reached Kiel the following day, where her crew stocked ammunition, fuel, and other supplies and applied a coat of dazzle paint to camouflage her. British bombers attacked the harbour without success on 12 March. On 17 March, the old battleship , now used as an icebreaker, escorted Bismarck through the ice to Gotenhafen, where the latter continued combat readiness training.|$|E

5|$|The McDonnell {{design was}} {{therefore}} reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company {{received a letter}} of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill {{the need for an}} all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; she met him at a church and was {{with him as he}} turned himself in. Many left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

5|$|At 00:00 on 5 December, two {{companies}} of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti. <b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> vicious fighting had erupted throughout the town as the {{two companies}} of Canadian infantry struggled to break the German defensive lines. As B Company broke through the German defences, A Company attacked to the northeast, continuing to engage 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment (200. Panzergrenadier_Regiment) near Villa Rogatti. Although two Canadian infantry companies now occupied Villa Rogatti, German Panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences {{on the outskirts of}} the town. However, C Company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant resistance from the 361st Panzergrenadier Regiment (361. Panzergrenadier-Regiment). After approximately an hour of fighting by C and D Companies, Villa Rogatti had been occupied by Canadian forces shortly before dawn.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45 on 25 November an Ottoman cavalry patrol near Khurbet Hadrah was chased {{off by a}} {{troop of}} 3rd Squadron Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment. <b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> the Ottoman 3rd and 7th Divisions {{launched}} a heavy attack on the squadron, which withdrew to a prearranged line. Just 30minutes later another withdrawal was forced. At about 08:00 infantry units of the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Khurbet Hadrah were ordered back across the river. It was an extremely difficult operation as the bridge was now being swept by enemy fire and continuously shelled by artillery. Some individuals succeeded in crossing the bridge; some swam the river and some drowned. Once the infantry were clear, the 3rd Squadron, Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment followed them across the bridge. The 11th (North Auckland) Squadron (Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment) covered them with two Vickers guns at great cost, continuing to hold the bridge until 11:00, when they withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E

5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, Angel spent 24 hours {{shackled}} underwater {{in a phone}} booth-sized {{water torture}} cell near the WWE entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being {{the owners of the}} World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for the trick, he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in East Meadow, New York. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance {{to make it through the}} period without need to exit and use the washroom. During the trick he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After the trick he was required to remove his own shackles and chains before exiting the water. <b>Within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> his skin began to react substantially to the water.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} week, the Royalist forces held the siege, {{but did not}} engage with the town again until 6 May, when they attacked the town in three places during a thick fog. The defenders were caught out slightly, as many of their soldiers were eating their evening supper. The Parliamentarians rallied quickly, and <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> had repelled the attack. An account kept by the Lyme Regis garrison records that around one hundred of the besieging army had been killed, while the garrison had only lost one man. The following day, Maurice requested a parley so that the dead could be buried. That request was granted, {{in exchange for the}} town's defenders being able to claim any weaponry on the battleground. Over the next week, there was little fighting between the armies, and a further seven ships arrived to aid the town, including 240 soldiers from Sir William Waller's army, and on 15 May a further 120 men were sent by the Earl of Warwick.|$|E

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity {{is one of}} the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{disembark}} {{in nearby}} Mombasa, as originally thought by the evacuees, the ships were ordered back to Oman—a five-day journey. The sailors and marines made {{way for the}} evacuees to share living quarters. When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{and some of the}} sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children. At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks. On 11 January, the evacuees were offloaded at Muscat, Oman. That afternoon, the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.|$|E
5|$|The White Sox led {{for most}} of the season {{starting}} with a tie for first on May 17, held at least a share of the lead for 154 days, and never dropped more than a game behind the leader. The Twins spent much of the season in second place behind the White Sox, along with 54 days in the lead. Despite going 11–15 in September, the Twins took a half-game lead with an extra innings win over the White Sox on September 25 that capped a three-game sweep of Chicago. The Twins maintained that lead through their final game, forcing Chicago to play a make-up on September 29 against the Tigers which had been rained out earlier that month. The White Sox won, 8–2, leaving the Sox and Twins tied atop the AL Central with 88–74 records, forcing a tie-breaker to decide the division. Tickets for the tie-breaker sold out <b>within</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> {{of the end of the}} September 29 game.|$|E
