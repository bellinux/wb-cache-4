5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization. As they do, Michael meets James (John Pyper-Ferguson), the man calling the shots for Sonya and Burke, and after passing some intense tests, Michael is welcomed into James's [...] "family". It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out those who need it like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband. As the show ends, Michael asks Fiona <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>he</b> tell Charlie when he is older. Fi says Michael should tell him the truth, but Michael doesn't know where to start. Fiona tells him to start from the beginning, by saying, [...] "My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy." ...|$|E
