5|$|At {{the end of}} the Sicilian {{campaign}} Durnford-Slater {{took over}} command of a brigade-sized element consisting of No. 3 and No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and the Special Raiding Squadron and as a result Peter Young took over command of the unit. Following this, in late August 1943, after receiving replacements from No. 12 Commando which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being disbanded, the unit carried out a number of reconnaissance operations across the Strait in preparation for the invasion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{contract}} {{negotiations with the}} Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) were due again {{at the end of}} 1986, the bus line <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of being sold to Dallas-based investors. By early 1987, Greyhound Lines had returned to being a stand-alone bus transportation company. Under CEO Fred Currey, a former executive of rival Continental Trailways, Greyhound's corporate headquarters relocated to Dallas, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained.

5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E
5|$|Two brigades of the Australian 9th Division {{with large}} numbers of support units invaded the Brunei Bay area on 10 June 1945.

5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|According to statistics, the South Okanagan {{region is}} underserved {{in terms of}} airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport {{provides}} international flights to 62commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475people, totaling 25percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport {{was considered to be}} the area's primary airport, hence why people questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of expansion.|$|E

5|$|After {{their initial}} {{founding}} with one milk supplier, Beecher's production system {{has had to}} expand several times to include more suppliers. As of 2006, Beecher's <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of purchasing their own farms in Eastern Washington for additional milk production, which will also give them full control over their entire product's creation. The principal milk supplier is Green Acres Farm in Duvall, Washington, using only hormone-free and antibiotic-free milk. When consistent milk production first became a problem, Beecher's purchased a herd of 200 cows. The entire dairy herd at Green Acres Farm is owned by Beecher's, who leases {{them back to the}} farm. For the New York production, all Holstein and Jersey milk come directly from Dutch Hollow Farms in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} {{was presented to}} parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for {{an extension of the}} City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant {{that it had to be}} re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, presented to parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E
5|$|An early {{problem was}} whether {{to adopt the}} British or Australian {{organisation}}. In 1939 the British Army <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of re-equipping with new weapons, and a new organisation was required. This new equipment was not available in Australia, so {{it was decided to}} organise the first unit to be raised—the 6th Division—with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new. Consequently, the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel, and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies, a battalion headquarters, regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals, mortars, carriers, pioneers, anti-aircraft and administration. Artillery support was provided by three field regiments, each attached at brigade-level, as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles. Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion, and various engineer, logistics and communication units.|$|E

5|$|By 2001 NFF <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements {{in the top}} leagues, and Briskeby {{would no longer be}} permitted {{to be used in the}} top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and grass fields to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August. She {{and the rest of}} the fleet sailed to {{intercept}} the British battleship , which was steaming to Alexandria, and a convoy sailing to Malta. The Italian fleet did not have sufficient aerial reconnaissance, which, along with bad weather, prevented the Italians from locating the British forces. They put back in to Taranto on 1 September. Caio Duilio again put to sea on 7 September, in an attempt to catch the British Force H, but the Italian intelligence was faulty, as Force H <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of attacking Dakar. Caio Duilio returned to Taranto, where she remained until early November.|$|E
