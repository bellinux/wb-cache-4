5000|$|Following his {{split with}} Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham {{spent much of}} the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo album, Out of the Cradle, which was {{released}} in 1992. Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band. [...] "There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left. If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things.

[...] "Wrong" [...] was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwoods tell-all biography. Out of the Cradle received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac. However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992-93 for the first time as a solo artist; his band included an army of seven other guitarists (Buckingham himself calls them [...] "the crazy band" [...] on his Soundstage DVD), each of whom he individually taught the entire two-and-a-half hours of music from the concert (Lindsey Buckingham: Behind the Music documentary for VH-1, 2001).|$|E

I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team. Im just a small part of a big deal tonight.Gray: With the overwhelming evidence in that report, why not make that step...Rose: No. This is too much of a festive night to worry about that because I dont know what evidence youre talking about. I mean, show it to me...Gray: Well, the Dowd Report says- but we dont want to debate that, Pete.Rose: Well, why not? Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban. Why did you sign it if you didnt agree with it?Rose: It also says I can apply for reinstatement after one year, if you remember correctly. In the press conference, as a matter of fact, my statement was [...] "I cant wait for my little girl to be a year old so I can apply for reinstatement". At my press conference. So you forgot to add that clause that was in there.Gray: Well, you have reapplied. ... Youve applied for reinstatement in 1997. Have you heard back from Commissioner Selig?Rose: No, and that kind of surprises me. Its only been two years, though, and hes got a lot of things on his mind. But I hope to some day.Gray: Pete, its been 10 years since youve been allowed on the field. Obviously, the approach that you have taken has not worked. Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be. How do you respond to that?Rose: In what way are you talking about?Gray: By not acknowledging what seems to be overwhelming evidence.Rose: Yeah, Im surprised youre bombarding me like this. I mean Im doing an interview with you on a great night, a great occasion, a great ovation. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. And youre bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.Gray: Im bringing it up because I think people would like to see ... Pete, <b>weve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go, weve got a game.Rose: This is a prosecutors brief, not an interview, and Im very surprised at you.
