5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} toxicity, chromium(VI) salts {{are used for}} the {{preservation}} of <b>wood.</b> <b>For</b> example, chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is used in timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E

5|$|European pioneer {{farmers in}} the prairies of North America, {{where there is no}} <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance.

5|$|Lumber thus {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to preserve their food, the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E

It was designed by Cosworth engine designer David <b>Wood</b> <b>for</b> Austin Rover Group's Metro derived Group B rally car, the MG Metro 6R4. The redesign work necessary to create the Jaguar/TWR JV6 engine was undertaken by Andrew Barnes, TWR's Powertrain Manager, and also involved Swiss engine builder Max Heidegger who had designed and built the race engines used in the XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{total size}} of the Roman {{garrison}} in Scotland during the Flavian period of occupation {{is thought to have}} been some 25,000 troops, requiring 16–19,000 tons of grain per annum. In addition, the material to construct the forts was substantial, estimated at 1 million cubic feet (28,315m3) of timber during the 1st century. Ten tons of buried nails were discovered at the Inchtuthil site, which may have had a garrison of up to 6,000 men and which itself consumed 30linear kilometres of <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> the walls alone, which would have used up 100hectares (247acres) of forest.|$|E

5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food, <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the Spanish. In addition, pigs had been introduced by the Spanish and were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Arras, the 33rd {{was moved to}} Nieuwpoort, Belgium, {{as part of the}} build-up for the planned Operation Hush, a breakthrough along the coastal front coupled with an amphibious landing behind German lines. After the operation was cancelled, the division remained at Niewpoort, where Pinney was hospitalised and temporarily relinquished command. He remained in hospital for two months, during which time he missed heavy fighting by the 33rd at the Battle of Passchendaele. After VIII Corps Commander Hunter-Weston had sacked the current divisional commander, Philip. R. <b>Wood,</b> <b>for</b> lack of aggression (unjustifiably, in Simon Robbins’ view), Pinney returned to the division on 30 November, amid rumours that he had got the return posting through personal influence.|$|E

5|$|In Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797–1871) {{started making}} pianos in 1835 {{from his house}} in Seesen {{at the edge of}} the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg {{produced}} in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825–1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.|$|E

The PhiladelphiaErie Pike (present day Pennsylvania Route 504) opened the Black Moshannon area to settlers by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes Tavern along the Pike, trapped fur-bearing animals, and cleared land for farming.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands during the Second World War essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by the Third Reich, {{a few weeks after}} the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey, German soldiers landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, The Invasion of the Isle of Wight. Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits. Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island for a few weeks, and mines were placed in an area. Occasionally German soldiers would travel to Herm to cut <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> fuel. In April 1945 a German officer, Oberst von Helldorf was exiled to Herm for not displaying sufficient loyalty to the Führer.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the <b>wood</b> <b>for</b> the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E
