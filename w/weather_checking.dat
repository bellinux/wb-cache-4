The OST monitors weather from their operations center and <b>weather</b> <b>checks</b> are performed every two hours. If the convoys are going to encounter or do encounter adverse weather, provisions exist for the convoys to seek shelter at previously identified facilities. As an additional travel precaution, the OST has imposed a maximum 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on its convoys, even if the posted limit is greater.|$|R
500|$|As {{the weather}} deteriorated, radio contact became intermittent, {{and it was}} {{believed}} that the five aircraft were actually by that time more than [...] out to sea east of the Florida peninsula. Taylor radioed [...] "We'll fly 270 degrees west until landfall or running out of gas" [...] and requested a <b>weather</b> <b>check</b> at 17:24. By 17:50 several land-based radio stations had triangulated Flight 19's position as being within a [...] radius of Flight 19 was north of the Bahamas and well off the coast of central Florida, but nobody [...] transmitted this information on an open, repetitive basis.|$|R

When a storm hits, sufferers either watch for severe weather alerts constantly or take cover, like under the bed or in the windowless room. In the extreme cases, sufferers take tornado shelter as soon as rain starts falling, usually in the basement or storm shelter. Sufferers who have weather radio or mobile phones can watch the radar and alerts using it while hiding.|$|R

5|$|Later {{variants}} of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 {{was to be}} a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for <b>weather</b> <b>check</b> flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 Imperial Gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, La Salle and Henri de Tonti, had {{departed}} Fort Frontenac {{in a second}} vessel some days after La Mothe and Hennepin. This was a [...] "great bark" [...] (Hennepin's words) of about 20 tons burden [...] although Tonti's journal says this was a 40-ton vessel. The vessel carried anchors, chain, guns, cordage, and cable for Le Griffon, as well as supplies and provisions for the anticipated journey. La Salle followed the southern shore of the lake. La Salle decided to visit the Senecas at Tagarondies himself. He put ashore near present-day Rochester, New York, and arrived at Tagarondies very shortly after La Motte and Hennepin had left. He was more successful in securing the Indians' tolerance of his proposed [...] "big canoe" [...] and support buildings. With La Salle back aboard their vessel, the company again sailed west until, about [...] from Niagara, <b>weather</b> <b>checked</b> their progress. There was some disagreement between La Salle and the ship's pilot, and La Salle and Tonti went ahead on foot to Niagara. When they arrived there La Motte and Hennepin had not yet returned. While there La Salle selected a site for building Le Griffon.|$|R
2500|$|The Panel {{believed}} {{strongly that}} the data available on this sighting was sufficient for positive identification if further data is obtained by photographing polyethylene [...] "pillow" [...] balloons released near the site under similar <b>weather</b> conditions, <b>checking</b> bird flight and reflection characteristics with competent ornithologists and calculating apparent [...] "G" [...] forces acting upon objects from their apparent tracks.

The natives of Ashanti and the surrounding tribes have received a lesson that will not be forgotten for a great number of years and, long before that time, it may be hoped that civilization will have made such strides there that there will be no more chance of trouble. They have been taught that they are absolutely unable to stand against the white man; that neither distance, the thickness of their forests, stockades, nor <b>weather</b> can <b>check</b> the progress of British troops; and that resistance can only draw down upon them terrible loss, and the destruction of their villages and crops.|$|R

Using this test we get that all injective and projective tensor norms different from ε and π destroy unconditionality, both in full and symmetric tensor products.

Analogous problems for multilinear and operator ideals are addressed. Comment: 23 page...|$|R

50|$|After {{receiving}} an early-morning weather {{report for the}} region which predicted a visibility of 2.5 miles (4 km) and wind from a bearing of 60° at a speed of 19 to 24 mph (30 to 39 km/h) at 1,600 feet (488m), de Wet declined a <b>weather</b> balloon <b>check</b> of wind conditions and the three Blenheims, each with four men aboard, took off from Kufra. After initial communications checks with Kufra, nothing was heard from the aircraft until 7:10 hours. In the meantime, the three Blenheim crews believed that they had successfully completed their flight, identifying each waypoint and planning to arrive at Kufra between 07:33 and 07:42 hours. However, Allied personnel at Rebiana did not hear them fly past, suggesting that they already were off course {{by the time they}} thought they had completed the first leg of their flight. A contributing factor may have been that a weather balloon launched shortly after they took off revealed that the earlier weather report was wrong, and that winds at 2,200 feet (670 m) actually were blowing at 31 mph (50 km/h) from a bearing of 290°, and one of the navigators aboard the planes noted that the flight was so bumpy that he was unable to take drift readings.|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn this dissertation, {{the aim was}} to {{evaluate}} and compare the performance of biodegradable mulch relatively to conventional polyethylene. For this purpose three different “mulches” were tested: polyethylene (PE) and two biodegradable "Short Cycle" (SC) and "Salads" (S) developed from the Mater-Bi™ matrix. Escarole (Cichorium endivia L.) crop cycle was monitored along the experimental study implemented at real scale. The monitoring plan was developed {{to evaluate}} the crop productivity and the impact of the different “mulches” in terms of moisture and soil temperature. The results achieved during this study showed the adaptability of biodegradable plastics to the soil and <b>weather</b> conditions, <b>checking</b> a significant difference in productivity of plants covered with plastic S relative to the other two modes (PE and SC). Given that to date there is no biodegradation studies in the Alentejo region of Portugal soils, it was also important to check the level of biodegradability of these new plastic films following the norm DIN EN ISO 17556.

Your WeatherFX will start to display weather information for your area once it automatically connects to the network that relays the data from AccuWeather. You will typically see most (or all) of your area’s weather information appear on the display within the first 15 minutes, however the time it takes for the display to show all of the data on the larger models may take longer (up to a few hours after it is first powered on), and can vary depending on your location, so please be patient.

If you seem to be having trouble receiving <b>weather</b> data, <b>check</b> the Signal Strength Indicator bars to the right of “ambient ” in the top right corner of the display.
