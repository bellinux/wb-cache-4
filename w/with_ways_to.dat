5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee experimented <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee experimented with different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{iconography}} {{which seeks to}} identify meaning, semiotics is concerned with how meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the connoted meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> navigate and interpret connoted meaning.|$|E
25|$|The Type 94 37mm AT {{guns were}} {{typically}} assigned {{in groups of}} four to combat infantry regiments. Each weapon was manned by a squad of 11 personnel, and was kept {{in contact with the}} regimental headquarters (typically up to 300 meters away) by field telephone or messenger runners. With the standard AP shell, it could penetrate 1.7 inches (43mm) of armor at 500 yards (460 meters). The Army Technical Bureau continued to experiment <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> increase muzzle velocity through 1941.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Brown {{returned}} to the University of Chicago to work as {{an assistant professor of}} Chemistry in the Institute for Nuclear Studies. He was joined by some of his former colleagues from the Manhattan Project and together they became the first team to study nuclear geochemistry. He went on to study meteorites and planetary structures along <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> date the age of the Earth, encouraging George Tilton and Clair Cameron Patterson to investigate the isotopic composition of iron meteorites. Patterson's studies of lead eventually led to the first close approximation of the age of the Earth and the solar system of 4.5 billion years. Another of his doctoral students, Edward D. Goldberg, measured trace occurrences of gallium, gold, palladium, and rhenium in meteorites, he was able to group iron meteorites based on their geochemical composition. In 1948 Brown was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science prize for his work on meteorites.|$|E

25|$|Other {{treatment}} methods {{may be used}} in psychiatric emergency service settings. Brief psychotherapy can be used to treat acute conditions or immediate problems as long as the patient understands his or her issues are psychological, the patient trusts the physician, the physician can encourage hope for change, the patient has motivation to change, the physician is aware of the psychopathological history of the patient, and the patient understands that their confidentiality will be respected. The process of brief therapy under emergency psychiatric conditions includes the establishment of a primary complaint from the patient, realizing psychosocial factors, formulating an accurate representation of the problem, coming up <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> solve the problem, and setting specific goals. The information gathering aspect of brief psychotherapy is therapeutic because it helps the patient place his or her problem in the proper perspective. If the physician determines that deeper psychotherapy sessions are required, he or she can transition the patient out of the emergency setting and into an appropriate clinic or center.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Deng Xiaoping's {{policies}} continued {{beyond the}} initial reforms. Controls on private businesses and government intervention continued to decrease, {{and there was}} small-scale privatization of state enterprises which had become unviable. A notable development was the decentralization of state control, leaving local provincial leaders to experiment <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> increase economic growth and privatize the state sector. Township and village enterprises, firms nominally owned by local governments but effectively private, began to gain market share {{at the expense of}} the state sector. Conservative elder opposition, led by Chen Yun, prevented many major reforms which would have damaged the interests of special interest groups in the government bureaucracy. Corruption and increased inflation increased discontent, contributing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and a conservative backlash after that event which ousted several key reformers and threatened to reverse many of Deng's reforms. However, Deng stood by his reforms and in 1992, he affirmed the need to continue reforms in his southern tour. He also reopened the Shanghai Stock Exchange closed by Mao 40 years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Some historians, as well {{as writers}} on human rights, have {{supported}} {{the interpretation of the}} Cyrus Cylinder as a human rights charter. W.J. Talbott, an American philosopher, believes the concept of human rights is a 20th-century concept but describes Cyrus as [...] "perhaps the earliest known advocate of religious tolerance" [...] and suggests that [...] "ideas that {{led to the development of}} human rights are not limited to one cultural tradition." [...] The Iranian lawyer Hirad Abtahi argues that viewing the Cylinder as merely [...] "an instrument of legitimizing royal rule" [...] is unjustified, as Cyrus issued the document and granted those rights when he was at the height of his power, with neither popular opposition nor visible external threat to force his hand. A former Iranian prime minister, Hassan Pirnia, writing in the early 20th century, characterizes the Cylinder as [...] "discuss human rights in a way unique for the era, dealing <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> protect the honor, prestige, and religious beliefs of all the nations dependent to Iran in those days." ...|$|E

500|$|S. T. Karnick, {{editor of}} American Culture, {{wrote an article}} for the National Review {{detailing}} the impact Friday the 13th has had on the slasher genre and noting that the reasons critics have deplored the films are the same reasons why the franchise has had such a strong influence. Karnick explained that Friday the 13th did not try and recreate the same [...] "clever" [...] film that John Carpenter made in 1978, but instead [...] " [...] the formula" [...] of Halloween, and [...] " [...] it down to its essentials" [...] {{so that it could}} be copied by other filmmakers. In his assessment, Friday the 13th changed the horror genre by purposefully not providing back‑stories for characters so that when the audience witnessed a character's death, they are [...] "strangely unaffected". Instead, Friday the 13th focuses on the history and motivations of the killer, who would exact revenge not on the people directly responsible, but on innocent people—a formula Karnick notes was replicated in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Saw, the Hannibal Lecter films, and the Halloween sequels. As Karnick sees it, [...] "these films spoke directly to fears of increasing crime and social dislocation [...] provided audiences <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> detach from these worries and conquer their fears of violence by laughing at it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Lord Mayor {{opened the}} first part of the new works on 28 October 1909, and Sheffield Council {{increased}} the amount of land they owned for sewage treatment to [...] by buying another , on which contact beds could be constructed if required at a later date. Discharges to the river were still of poor quality, and a secondary treatment process was designed, although its implementation was delayed by the onset of the First World War. However, John Haworth became works manager in 1914, and began to experiment <b>with</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> treat the effluent. A continuous narrow channel was constructed within a tank, and paddles were used to agitate the liquid. This allowed it to become oxygenated, which supported bacteria, allowing them to digest the sewage. The process was called bio-aeration, but became known as the [...] "Sheffield System", and a steady stream of people came to inspect the works, both from local authorities in Great Britain and from overseas. Many of the contact beds were converted to use the new system between 1922 and 1927. The treatment process significantly reduced the biochemical oxygen demand of the effluent discharged to the river, but was not good at removing ammonia, which was a major contributor to the poor water quality of the river below the works, and the destruction of the fish populations. The effluent regularly contained more than 20mg/l of ammonia, which resulted in levels of over 10mg/l in the river. Few fish can survive in concentrations of over 2mg/l.|$|E
