5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of the Sh'erit ha-Pletah had {{in common}} was what had made them victims in the first place, {{but other than that}} they were a diverse group. Their outlook, needs, and {{aspirations}} varied tremendously. There were strictly observant Jews as well as individuals that had earlier been assimilated into secular culture. Religious convictions ran from the Revisionist group to Labor Zionists and even ideological communists. Although Yiddish was the common language within the community, individuals came from virtually every corner of Europe.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements over <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E

They select their cases based on a criterion the organisation has established, which depends {{on a wide range}} of factors, such as the reliability and continuity of the information, the gravity of the situation the tribe in question is facing, the degree to which they believe their work can make a real difference, the degree to which improvements in this area would have a knock on effect for others, whether any other organisation is already working on the case, and whether they are sure of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> themselves want.|$|E
25|$|Necker {{was viewed}} as the savior of France {{by many as the}} country stood on the brink of ruin, but his actions could not stop the French Revolution. Necker put a stop to the {{rebellion}} in the Dauphiné by legalizing the Assembly of Vizille, and then set to work to arrange for the summons of the Estates-General of 1789. He advocated doubling the representation of the Third Estate to satisfy the people. But he failed to address the matter of voting – rather than voting by head count, which is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> wanted, voting remained as one vote for each estate. Also, his address at the Estates-General was terribly miscalculated: it lasted for hours, and while those present expected a reforming policy to save the nation, he gave them financial data. This approach had serious repercussions on Necker's reputation; he appeared to consider the Estates-General to be a facility designed to help the administration rather than to reform government.|$|E

Some day, though, I'd like to make another movie that kids could go and see."

The trio made {{a summer}} tour called Kansalle mitä kansa haluaa ("Give People <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> Want") {{but at times}} Vainio was too {{intoxicated}} to perform. Vainio and Reijo Tani made a collection of singles in 1968 called Juha [...] "Watt" [...] Vainio ja Reijo Tani. The album included Vainio's Kauhea kankkunen ("Horrible Hangover") and Vanha salakuljettaja Laitinen ("Old Smuggler Laitinen"), which were both collaborations with Toivo Kärki. The latter song was named after Keijo Laitinen, {{a good friend of}} Vainio's. In 1970 Vainio started writing causeries with Gunnar Mattsson.|$|E
500|$|The term urf, meaning [...] "to know", {{refers to}} the customs and {{practices}} of a given society. Although this was not formally included in Islamic law, the sharia recognizes customs that prevailed {{at the time of}} Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur'an or the tradition (called [...] "Divine silence"). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> in general, consider good is also considered as such by God. According to some sources, urf holds as much authority as ijma (consensus), and more than qiyas (analogical deduction). Urf is the Islamic equivalent of [...] "common law".|$|E

In a 1960 retrospective, the company attributed the film's failure to a conflict of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> wanted and what was provided; the write-up stated that Ismail had not meant to portray the military as it should be, but as it was– as well as individuals within it.|$|E

Voters supported repealing the gay rights ordinance by a margin of more than two to one.

500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E

500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E
500|$|When Colt {{returned}} to the United States in 1832, {{he went back to}} work for his father, who financed the production of two guns, a rifle and a pistol. The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired, but the rifle performed well. His father would not finance any further development, so Samuel needed {{to find a way to}} pay for the development of his ideas. He had learned about nitrous oxide (laughing gas) from the factory chemist in his father's textile plant, so he took a portable lab on the road and earned a living performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and Canada, billing himself as [...] "the Celebrated Dr. Coult of New-York, London and Calcutta". Colt conceived of himself as a man of science and thought if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide, he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver. He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums. As ticket sales declined, Colt realized that [...] "serious" [...] museum lectures were not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> wanted to pay money to see and that it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved. While visiting his brother, John, in Cincinnati, he partnered with sculptor, Hiram Powers, for his demonstrations with a theme based on The Divine Comedy. Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons, centaurs and mummies from Dante. Colt constructed fireworks to complete the show, which was a success. According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson, the [...] "lectures launched Colt's celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue-style pitchman". His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic on board a riverboat by giving his patients a dose of nitrous oxide.|$|E
