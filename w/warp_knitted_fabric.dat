Due to the differential shrinkage property, the fabric becomes curly and bulkier, simulating cotton fabric {{in terms of its}} appearance and fabric handle. The performance and appearance of these DS polyester warp knitted fabrics were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric.</b> Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment. Besides, the fabric handle was evaluated by Kawabata evaluation system and subject to trial under dry and wet fabric condition.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{construction}} of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> upon their bursting strengths and absorbability are the subject of this paper. 	The following results have been obtained from our experiments. 	(1) The bursting strengths of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> made of same material are subject to the densities of fabrics and the toughness of underlap yarns. As the differences of underlap lengths are very little among <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> with same weave and various densities, the bursting strengths of such fabrics are mostly determined by their densities. As the density of the fabric is increased, the bursting strength is greatly increased within certain limits of smaller density, and then with the gradually diminishing rate of increase. But the bursting strength does not noticcably increase beyond a certain limit of density. 	(2) The bursting strengths of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> with same density and various weaves are determined by their underlap lengths and the numbers of the crossing of underlap with loop. The bursting strengths of the same density fabrics are increased with the underlap length of the fabric. 	(3) The absorbability of <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> made of same material is determined by the porosity of yarn itself and the inclined porosity between each crossing yarn in unit areas of the fabrics. In case of <b>fabrics</b> <b>knitted</b> with same density, both the total amount of water absorbed (a) and the rate of absorption of water (b) are increased with the increase of the density of the fabric.

The aim of the project {{is to create a}} virtual textile that a person can perceive, touch and manipulate. The multimodal interaction consists of visual representation of the cloth simulation and haptic and tactile interface which are integrated and the user is allowed to sense and identify the typical properties of different kinds of fabrics.

The KES-F (Kawabata) system offers a sensitive measurement method for the determination of bending, compression, tensile, shear, surface roughness and friction properties. Some modifications to the standard tests were required, in order to provide appropriate input for the simulation of the fabrics. All properties are needed for the haptic/tactile rendering, whereas the tensile, shear and bending properties are used for the visual rendering.
