Moreover, recurrent vector equations are investigated for the synthesis of linkages, and used for the design of new mechanisms with linear-angular conditions in the subspace with general constraint one. These conditions are generalized for defining the structural groups of subspace [...] 5 and these structural groups are used both for the creation of new parallel manipulators and new serial-parallel platform manipulators. After investigating hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpets,</b> the knowledge gained during the structural design of mechanisms is applied to the robotization of hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> technology process. Finally, design of <b>carpet</b> <b>weaving</b> robot is introduced...|$|R

It is also significant in economic terms and they make valuable contribution in exports. Cotton is the raw material required for this industry. They employ women and children for the production of fine hand <b>woven</b> <b>carpets</b> and for the production of wool silk or a mixture of the two, as the carpets are of great significance. Therefore, children are employed and child labor takes place.|$|R

25|$|Flat <b>woven</b> <b>carpets</b> {{are given}} their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly {{intertwined}} with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.|$|R

25|$|Another knot {{frequently}} used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet {{can be made}} with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as <b>carpets</b> <b>woven</b> wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally <b>woven</b> <b>carpets,</b> their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.|$|R

40|$|An applied {{research}} program is {{considered for a}} preliminary design and development of a flexible ablative covering for the space shuttle vehicle that could be easily replaced and/or refurbished. The program was structured to concentrate resources on the major technical problem areas associated with the flexible ablator concept. These areas included: (1) fabrication of a suitable <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> reinforcement, (2) modification of a flexible ablator formulation for filling the <b>woven</b> <b>carpet</b> construction, and (3) testing of the flexible ablator concept. Several approaches were evaluated to obtain a flexible ablator. The final recommended solution was {{one in which the}} ablative filler was based on a low-density formulation of the elastomeric shield material series (ESM). The preferred approach is one in which a light-weight fabric backing is bonded to preformed and fully cured ESM, and the composite tufted with Astroquartz fiber to the desired tuft or pile density. Ablation tests performed in a hyperthermal arc facility demonstrated the ablation performance of the concept and overshoot capability of the system...|$|R
