5|$|When the Aryans first {{settled in}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Āryāvarta (or Madhyadesha), Allahabad (then Kaushambi) was an {{important}} part of their territory. The Kurus, rulers of Hastinapur (near present-day Delhi), established the town of Kaushambi near Allahabad. They shifted their capital to Kaushambi when Hastinapur was destroyed by floods.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the {{municipal}} bus company Bergen Sporvei made {{a proposal to}} establish <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to Møhlenpris and the city center, then make a 120° turn and return along {{the route of the}} Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via Åsane to Flaktveit and southwards via Rådal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E

25|$|Upon arrival, Kulik made {{arrangements}} {{with the local}} Evenki hunters to guide his party to the impact site. Reaching the explosion site was an extremely arduous task. Upon reaching an area {{just south of the}} site, the superstitious Evenki hunters would go no farther, fearing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Valleymen. Kulik had to return to the nearby village, and his party was delayed for several days while they sought new guides.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the term}} Germanic has a {{linguistic}} definition today, Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus did not clearly divide the Celts from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Germans based on languages. On the contrary, both authors tended to emphasize, partly for political reasons, {{the differences in}} terms of the levels of civilization which had been attained, with Germanic peoples being wilder and less civilized peoples, requiring military and political considerations.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} the magnetron concept with resonator loops created by drilling holes in solid copper, an idea from W. W. Hansen's work on klystrons, the two constructed a model version of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> resonant cavity magnetron. They placed it inside a glass enclosure evacuated with an external vacuum pump, {{and placed the}} entire assembly between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet, which caused the electrons to bend around into a circular path.|$|E

Other new measures under the policy included irrigation programs, transmigration, communications, flood mitigation, industrialisation, and protection of native industry. Industrialisation did not significantly affect the majority of Indonesians, and Indonesia remained an agricultural colony; by 1930, there were 17 cities with populations over 50,000 and their combined populations numbered 1.87 million of the colony's 60 million.|$|E

25|$|Known {{instances}} of nuclear reactions, aside from producing energy, also produce nucleons and particles on readily observable ballistic trajectories. In {{support of their}} claim that nuclear reactions took place in their electrolytic cells, Fleischmann and Pons reported a neutron flux of 4,000 neutrons per second, as well as detection of tritium. The classical branching ratio for previously known fusion reactions that produce tritium would predict, with 1 watt of power, the production of 1012 neutrons per second, levels {{that would have been}} fatal to the researchers. In 2009, Mosier-Boss et al. reported <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> first scientific report of highly energetic neutrons, using CR-39 plastic radiation detectors, but the claims cannot be validated without a quantitative analysis of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the Nez Perce tribe began a {{breeding}} program, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa and a Central Asian breed called Akhal-Teke, to produce <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Nez Perce Horse. They wanted to restore {{part of their}} traditional horse culture, where they had conducted selective breeding of their horses, long considered a marker of wealth and status, and trained their members in a high quality of horsemanship. Social disruption due to reservation life and assimilationist pressures by Americans and the government resulted {{in the destruction of}} their horse culture in the 19thcentury. The 20th-century breeding program was financed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Nez Perce tribe, and the nonprofit called the First Nations Development Institute. It has promoted businesses in Native American country that reflect values and traditions of the peoples. The Nez Perce Horse breed is noted for its speed.|$|E
25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

500|$|Two rival communist-backed black {{nationalist}} groups initiated military {{campaigns to}} overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism–Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Second Chimurenga" [...] against the Rhodesian government and security forces.
