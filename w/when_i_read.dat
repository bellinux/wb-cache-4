500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea {{to create}} a story {{involving}} the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "Unit 731 first came to my attention {{at the same time}} as it did for a lot of other people, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it in the New York Times about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during the Second World War." [...] Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received [...] "clemency so [...] could use their science" [...] would be [...] "interesting".|$|E

500|$|Guest actor Jared Harris {{made his}} third {{appearance}} {{of the season in}} [...] "Ability". At the time, the actor had not heard whether his character would be returning, though he later appeared in the first season finale and five fourth season episodes. Harris described his character as an [...] "anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause" [...] and the episode as [...] "a page-turner... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it, I said, 'Ah, this is a fantastic one. I can't wait to see it.' It's directed with a lot of energy, a lot of tension. It's a good one, a really good one".|$|E
500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{set out in}} a {{sequence}} of the year's seasons, which, director Jason Reitman explains, [...] "really resonated with me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it, because they mirror the three trimesters of Juno's pregnancy." [...] Because filming took place over only 30 days, fake flora was used {{to give the impression}} of different seasons while other flora was edited in post-production. Brown leaves were composited onto a fake tree outside Juno's house and cherry blossom trees outside Leah's house were touched up in a lighter shade of pink to depict autumn; a fan was used to blow leaves around in some scenes as if the leaves were falling from trees. Fake flowers were used in front of Paulie's house {{at the end of the}} film to give the impression of summer. Reitman used different colors to inform character, such as the burgundy and gold Dancing Elk High School track uniforms and an early scene with Juno in a red hooded jacket [...] "walking through a world of somber greens and browns." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{remained}} serious. [...] "It was a {{very fine}} point,--a very little thing to reject a man for. <b>I</b> felt that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>read</b> her letter about it." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{see her as}} a {{slightly}} warped Mary Poppins. She's quite austere. She's a strong woman. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>read</b> the script, <b>I</b> thought, oh, well, of course she's a baddie... but the more <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it, <b>I</b> thought, 'No, she's doing what she's doing for legitimate reasons.'

500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|Ayola's other notable {{television}} appearances {{include the}} BBC psychological thriller Green-Eyed Monster (2001), soap opera EastEnders (2001), Waking the Dead (2001), London's Burning (2001), Offenders (2002), Murder in Mind (2003), The Canterbury Tales (2003) and Sea of Souls (2004). In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script made me laugh out loud <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it. [...] I also {{like the fact that}} there were a lot of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're not going to be restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.' I liked that. It wasn't some sort of reverential hands-off approach to what we're presenting." [...] She has also been cast in the film Dredd. She will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre, London from 24 May 2017, playing the role of Hermione Granger.|$|E

500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
2500|$|The director, Kieron Walsh, said in interview: “I {{was quite}} daunted at the {{prospect}} of filming one of the plays, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> Rough for Theatre I, I immediately saw the cinematic possibilities.

5000|$|When {{he started}} working at UTV, Simmons' job {{involved}} reading news and sports bulletins {{as well as}} introducing the channel's programmes, but he felt uneasy with newsreading. [...] "I didn't know what I was talking about...

I have this thing if I'm hearing bad news, or someone goes {{to tell me something}} grave... it must be a nervous thing, I feel myself starting to smirk.
