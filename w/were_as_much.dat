5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on marriage {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E

5|$|The spotted hyena's {{distribution}} once {{ranged in}} Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the Urals, where it remained {{for at least}} one million years. Remains have also been found in the Russian Far East, and it has been theorised that the presence of hyenas there may have delayed the colonisation of North America. The causes of the species' extinction in Eurasia are still largely unknown. In Western Europe at least, the spotted hyena's extinction coincided with a decline in grasslands 12,500 years ago. Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans which <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> at home in forests as in open lands, and in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 14–11,000 years ago, and earlier in some areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the invasion, the Allies {{conducted}} Operation Bodyguard, the overall strategy designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio-traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, and Fortitude South, a major deception designed to fool the Germans into believing that the landings would take place at Pas de Calais in July. A fictitious First U.S. Army Group was invented, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex under the command of Lieutenant General George S. Patton. The Allies constructed dummy tanks, trucks, and landing craft, and positioned them near the coast. Several military units, including II Canadian Corps and 2nd Canadian Division, moved into the area to bolster the illusion that a large force was gathering there. As well as the broadcast of fake radio-traffic, genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there. Patton remained stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais. Military and civilian personnel alike were aware of the need for secrecy, and the invasion troops <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible kept isolated, especially in the period immediately before the invasion. One American general was sent back to the United States in disgrace after revealing the invasion date at a party.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, the VFA {{first began}} playing premiership matches on Sundays. This allowed VFA matches {{to be played}} without {{competing}} the VFL for spectators, {{and within a few}} years, clubs found that Sunday matches <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as three to four times more lucrative than Saturday games. By the 1970s, all games were played on a Sunday, while the VFL played its games on Saturdays. This was similar to the College/Pro football day divide still present in the US. The Victorian Government supported the VFA's new-found vigour, and rejected requests by the VFL to hold its own games on Sundays until the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|Hyrax Hill {{is located}} near Lake Nakuru. 5000 to 6000 years ago, during the {{occupation}} of Site I, a wetter climate meant that lake levels <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 100 meters higher than their present levels. Hyrax Hill was a peninsula at this time, which jutted out into {{the north side of}} the lake. The occupants would have had access to a steady supply of fresh water, as well as fish. Mary Leakey identified the ancient rocky beach of the lake in her 1938 excavations. The early occupation of Site I lies directly on the ancient beach, and she was able to use this and relative dating to date this portion of the site.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} social {{structure}} changed as well. New social organizations, makanda, emerged. These makanda, nominally clans descended from common ancestors, <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> trading associations as family units. These clans founded strings of villages connected by fictional kinship along the trade routes, from Boma or {{the coast of}} Soyo to São Salvador and then on into the interior. A new oral tradition about {{the founder of the}} kingdom, often held to be Afonso I, described the kingdom as originating when the king caused the clans to disperse in all directions. The histories of these clans, typically describing the travels of their founder and his followers from an origin point to their final villages, replaced in many areas the history of the kingdom itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta) diverged from the striped and brown hyena 10 million years ago. Its direct {{ancestor}} was the Indian Crocuta sivalensis, which lived during the Villafranchian. Ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours {{in response to}} increased pressure from rivals on carcasses, thus forcing them to operate in teams. Spotted hyenas evolved sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars, therefore they {{did not need to}} wait for their prey to die, as is the case for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's turf. Spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the Middle Pleistocene, and quickly colonised a very wide area from Europe, to southern Africa and China. With the decline of grasslands 12,500 years ago, Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans, who <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> at home in forests as in open landsand in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 11 and 14 thousand years ago, and earlier in some areas.|$|E

500|$|The geology {{consists}} of a dark breccia of gabbros and dolerites intruding Archaean gneiss. In prehistoric times, the area was covered by ice sheets that spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean. After the last retreat of the ice circa 20,000 years BP, sea levels <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as [...] lower than at present {{and it is likely}} that the existing islands were part of a much larger land mass, although still separated from the Outer Hebrides by many miles of open water.
