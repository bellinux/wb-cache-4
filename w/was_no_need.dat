5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism {{is considered one of the}} great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E

In 2008, the volume of AW101 orders was reported as having filled production capacity {{in excess of the}} following five years. By April 2009, more than 180 AW101s had been sold worldwide; the combined operational fleet had also accumulated a total of 170,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938.

5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E

The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E

5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to lengthen the signal {{as in the case}} of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, Spain gave Louisiana back to France in {{exchange}} for the promise of a throne in central Italy. Although the agreement was signed on October 1, 1800, it did not go into effect until 1802. The following year, Napoleon sold Louisiana to the United States. Many of the Spaniards who had moved to the colony left for Texas, Florida, or other Spanish-held lands. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. Even when both territories had been under Spanish control, there was disagreement on where the border should be. In 1793, the King of Spain decided that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to move the boundary from Natchitoches to the Sabine River, as had been recommended by some Frenchmen.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court Colin Rimer QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, {{held that}} since the shares were all identical, the lack of {{segregation}} between them did not invalidate the trust. The standard case in this area, Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different, while all of Moss's shares were identical. Rimer J instead cited with approval Rollestone v National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis, a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota where it was held that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for segregation in such a situation.|$|E
5|$|Irish {{zoologist}} Nicholas Aylward Vigors {{established the}} genus Platycercus in 1825, {{based on the}} distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, though there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Saggers {{started the}} tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon {{had played in}} each of Australia's 11 Tests since the {{resumption}} of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly {{before the start of}} the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.|$|E
5|$|The Minister {{had decided}} that the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents from taking part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest. Notably, the Court held that because {{the basis for the}} Minister's conclusion clearly could not be disputed, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for any hearing or inquiry as no purpose would have been achieved. The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his conclusions on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless the conclusions were irrelevant, the Court could not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E
5|$|The first dreadnoughts {{tended to}} have a very light {{secondary}} armament intended to protect them from torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.|$|E
