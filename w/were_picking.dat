On September23, authorities in Cuba evacuated 200,000 residents from coastal areas as Georges neared landfall. The Cuban Red Cross reported that nearly 500,000 people were evacuated, of which 200,000 were placed in shelters. Later reports stated that about 711,000 people were evacuated from dangerous areas. Flights {{in and out of}} the county were cancelled and schools were closed due to the storm. In addition to the evacuation of residents, more than 90,000 head of cattle were relocated to higher ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of the ALS, passenger cars having four or more occupants, taxis, public buses and service vehicles were allowed into the zone without being charged. Carpool was exempted too, to better manage demand and to counter the belief that the scheme favoured the rich. Special carpool pick-up points were set up. In 1989 more users were required to pay the fee, as motorcycles and heavy vehicles made up about two-thirds of the traffic entering the RZ. Hence, with this review of the policy, only buses and emergency vehicles were exempted. Later, the exemption for carpools was abolished, because many private cars <b>were</b> <b>picking</b> up bus commuters just to avoid the payment.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} if infants <b>were</b> <b>picking</b> {{up on the}} statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword {{made up of the}} same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi.|$|E

At the end of the season, he was picked for [...] "The Rest" [...] team, composed of the best players from the other states, for the match against the Shield winners, New South Wales, though he was upstaged by the 48-year-old Clarrie Grimmett, who took 10 wickets to Ring's one in the match. Wisden noted in a brief report on the 1939–40 Sheffield Shield in its 1940 edition that Bill O'Reilly, Grimmett and Ring [...] "carried off chief bowling honours in the competition". Prior to the Second World War, the Australian captain Don Bradman said of Ring: [...] "If I <b>were</b> <b>picking</b> an Australian XI to go to England now, one of the first men on my list would be Doug Ring".|$|E

500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we <b>were</b> <b>picking</b> up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

[...] The ratings, however, slid downward each successive week, and after the show completed its initial limited run, it did not reappear.

The song rose to Number one in the UK Charts and became one of the biggest hits of the year as well as ending up among the 50 best selling singles of the decade. The group were invited to appear at the 1977 Royal Variety Performance, where they elected to sing [...] "Angelo", rather than their then current single [...] "Highwayman". Deprived of this vital promotion, the single failed to enter the chart (although was 'bubbling under' the top 50 at the time). It did however become a top 20 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium. An accompanying album Images, similarly failed in the UK charts.|$|E
2500|$|Two PETA {{employees}} were acquitted in 2007 of animal cruelty after at least 80 euthanized animals {{were left in}} dumpsters in a shopping center in Ahoskie {{over the course of}} a month in 2005; the two {{employees were}} seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van.

2500|$|Ahead of the 1922 elections, with Brătianu again {{returning}} in power, Bujor {{declared an}} all-out {{fight with the}} [...] "oligarchy" [...] for the [...] "holy rights of liberty and justice."

During those weeks, he and Ion Răducanu were the two PȚ envoys negotiating an alliance with the PNR, the Conservative Democrats, and the Progressive Conservatives. He himself was returned to the Senate, when he defended himself against renewed accusations, voiced by the PNL's Victor Iamandi, that he had [...] "really done it" [...] with his [...] "dawn in the East" [...] statement.
