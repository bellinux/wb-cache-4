Lean {{thinking}} and operations challenges us {{to eliminate all}} waste—wasted time, wasted motion, wasted materials, wasted quality, wasted manpower, wasted machine hours, <b>wasted</b> <b>transportation</b> and <b>wasted</b> facilities. Unfortunately many see the concept of lean operations as just for factory floor operations, but {{it is much more}} than that. Indeed with all the work we have done in the last 25 years some of the best opportunities now are in the staff and service operations. Our challenge is to accept and apply the concept that lean {{thinking and}} lean operations apply to all facets of organizations to include leadership and management. Simply put lean thinking and lean operations are a mentality that calls for a comprehensive all out effort by everyone in the supply chain to identify and remove waste. It is all about eliminating costs from all processes. These ideas are ubiquitous and universal. We will understand the profound truth of that statement and how to make it work. “You can’t solve problems with the same thinking that caused them. ...|$|R
