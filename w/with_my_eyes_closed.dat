60|$|The cord which bound me was undone and {{the sack}} drawn from over my head. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> I lay {{motionless}} upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|I {{must really}} rest {{a little before}} I can get on any farther. When I have {{reclined}} for a few minutes, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and when Louis has refreshed my poor aching temples with a little eau-de-Cologne, I {{may be able to}} proceed.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} call up former {{favorite}} views of mountain and sea, so as to compare them with this; but the memory pictures refused to come, even <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> Then I returned to camp, with unsettled, troubled mind, and was silent, wondering at the strange feeling burning within me.|$|E
50|$|The single Even <b>With</b> <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>Close</b> {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Georg Siegl of Metal Heaven, but then the singer Robert Lindell quit the band and everything fell apart.|$|R
60|$|My {{method of}} {{mechanical}} hypnosis was {{the soul of}} simplicity. Sitting with folded legs on my straw-mattress, I gazed fixedly at a fragment of bright straw which I had attached {{to the wall of}} my cell near the door where the most light was. I gazed at the bright point, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> to it, and tilted upward till they strained to see. At the same time I relaxed all the will of me and gave myself to the swaying dizziness that always eventually came to me. And when I felt myself sway out of balance backward, I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and permitted myself to fall supine and unconscious on the mattress.|$|R
60|$|Thus, that {{delightful}} writer, WASHINGTON IRVING, in his Tales of a Traveller. But, {{it happened}} to me the other night to be lying: not <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> half <b>closed,</b> but <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> wide open; not <b>with</b> <b>my</b> nightcap drawn almost down to my nose, for on sanitary principles I never wear a nightcap: but <b>with</b> <b>my</b> hair pitchforked and touzled all over the pillow; not just falling asleep by any means, but glaringly, persistently, and obstinately, broad awake. Perhaps, with no scientific intention or invention, I was illustrating the theory of the Duality of the Brain; perhaps one part of my brain, being wakeful, sat up to watch the other part which was sleepy. Be that as it may, something in me was as desirous to go to sleep as it possibly could be, but something else in me WOULD NOT go to sleep, and was as obstinate as George the Third.|$|R
60|$|One night I {{was lying}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and to, all {{appearance}} sound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself without making the slightest sound. I {{could not imagine}} {{what she was going}} to do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her. When she was fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room.|$|E
6000|$|Now the {{sensible}} {{thing to do}} is to stop the narrator right at this point. Say to him quietly and firmly, [...] "Yes, I have heard that story. I always liked it ever since it came out in Tit Bits in 1878, and I read it every time I see it. Go on and tell it to me and I'll sit back <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> and enjoy it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{stood for}} a long time on the terrace, {{sometimes}} looking into the darkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse of her; sometimes <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> so that I might recall and hold in my mind her passage down the steps. For the first time since I had met her she had thrown back at me a glance as she stepped on the white path below the terrace. With the glamour over me of that look, which was all love and enticement, I could have dared all the powers that be.|$|E
6000|$|She faltered, {{and still}} I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed.</b> I {{did not want}} to wake up from that dream. [...] "Have I been very--very sad?" [...] she went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{the least}} tired," [...] she said coldly; [...] "I thank you, milor. The colours and the light were so {{dazzling}} for the moment, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> involuntarily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never forget}} any ground I've been over. I keep <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>close</b> ahead. All that seems {{strange to me}} is the wrong way. What I've seen, before must be the right way, because I saw it when they brought me from Surprise Valley." ...|$|R
60|$|I had not {{closed my}} eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century, and what of that and of my {{exhaustion}} I slept soundly. When I first awoke, it was night. Garthwaite had not returned. I had lost my watch and {{had no idea of}} the time. As I lay <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> I heard the same dull sound of distant explosions. The inferno was still raging. I crept through the store to the front. The reflection from the sky of vast conflagrations made the street almost as light as day. One could have read the finest print with ease. From several blocks away came the crackle of small hand-bombs and the churning of machine-guns, and from a long way off came a long series of heavy explosions. I crept back to my horse blankets and slept again.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look very}} happy to-night, dear child," [...] she said. [...] "I shall {{think of you}} often when I'm at Snowfield, and see your face before me as it is now. It's a strange thing--sometimes when I'm quite alone, sitting in my room <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> or walking over the hills, the people I've seen and known, if it's only been for a few days, are brought before me, and I hear their voices and see them look and move almost plainer than I ever did when they were really with me so as I could touch them. And then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot {{as if it was}} my own, and I take comfort in {{spreading}} it before the Lord and resting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own. And so I feel sure you will come before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} the night before his arrival that I learnt the truth. I was lying <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> and they thought that I was asleep. The doctor and my father were talking {{together}} in whispers. The crisis was over, I heard them say. In a few days Adrian would be born, and I should speedily recover, if all went well. I nerved myself, and called my father to me. I had overheard, I said; if Martin came, I would not marry him. His anger was terrible. Both Count Hirsfeld and he had known from the commencement that I was likely to recover, but they wished to see Martin tricked into marrying me. I was firm; I would not consent! I had written that letter believing myself to be dying. If Martin came, I would not see him now. If he was forced into my presence, I should tell him the truth.|$|E
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange that boys {{should be able}} to sleep under such {{circumstances}} as these, and yet the permission had no sooner been given by the scout than I was stretched out at full length, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closing</b> despite all efforts to keep them open.|$|R
60|$|Sleepily I {{thought we}} might find before many hours had passed that all the {{shooting}} {{was not to be}} done by us; but the idea was no more than in mind when <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> again, and I was not conscious of the surroundings until Kenton shook me roughly.|$|R
60|$|We covered twenty-two miles by sundown, {{a rather}} poor day's showing; and camped {{on the bare}} flat desert, using water and wood we had packed with us. The last thing I remembered, as <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed</b> heavily, was what a blessing it was to rest and to sleep.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} persuade {{her to sit}} by me or to do {{anything}} but move a ragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold my dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest on my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and all night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they became indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now it was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now some one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I was no one.|$|E
60|$|Hour {{after hour}} I lay {{perfectly}} still, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>closed,</b> in the semi-sleeping, semi-wakeful state {{which is so}} curiously characteristic of the ordinary repose of a dog. As the night wore on, such a sense of heaviness oppressed my eyelids that it was literally {{impossible for me to}} open them--such a masterful languor possessed all my muscles that I could no more move on my pillow than if I had been a corpse. And yet, in this somnolent condition, my mind was able to pursue lazy trains of pleasant thought. My sense of hearing was so acute that it caught the faintest sounds made by the passage of the night-breeze through the rushes of the lake. Inside my bed-chamber, I was even more keenly sensible of those weird night-noises in the heavy furniture of a room, of those sudden settlements of extinct coals in the grate, so familiar to bad sleepers, so startling to overwrought nerves! It is not a scientifically correct statement, but it exactly describes my condition, that night, to say that one half of me was asleep and the other half awake.|$|E

And across the table with his air of watchful, unmoved benevolence, enough in itself to arouse one’s interest, there was {{the man with the}} story of a shipwreck that mustn’t be shouted on housetops.

Doing things one can only do in dusk and glow and midsummer dreams, as if the back of my closed eyelids were a silver screen and I was a sentimental projectionist with hundreds of fanciful reels at hand, all ready to roll. Thus is the reasoning behind the title. Adam Young ...|$|E
