5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} the Shooter again, who {{tells him that}} Gibson is a missing link. Mulder {{believes}} that Gibson has genes that are dormant in most humans. The Smoking Man dismisses the Well-Manicured Man's concerns about Mulder's actions. At the prison, the guard kills the Shooter. Diana Fowley, protecting Gibson in a hotel room, is shot shortly afterwards, and Gibson is captured by the Smoking Man's minions. Skinner tells Mulder of the Shooter's death, and that a flattened Morley cigarette box was found in his cell. Mulder confronts Spender, accusing him {{of working with the}} Smoking Man. The Smoking Man turns Gibson over to the Well-Manicured Man. Scully is informed by Skinner that the Justice Department is seeking to have the X-Files shut down. Mulder realizes that this <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of a plan. The Smoking Man takes Samantha's X-File from Mulder's office, and lights the room on fire. As he leaves, he meets Jeffrey, and tells him that he's his father. By the time Mulder and Scully arrive, the X-Files are completely destroyed.|$|E

25|$|On 28 August 1799, Circe {{was at the}} Nieuwe Diep. There {{she took}} {{possession}} of 13 men-of-war, ranging in size form 66 guns to 24, and three Indiamen. She also took possession of the Naval Arsenal and its 95 pieces of ordnance. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of the Vlieter Incident, the surrender without a fight of a squadron of the navy of the Batavian Republic, commanded by Rear-Admiral Samuel Story, during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland to the British navy on a sandbank near the Channel known as De Vlieter, near Wieringen, on 30 August.|$|E

On 30 June 2008 the Department of Transport began public bus service in Abu Dhabi with four routes. There are also public buses serving the airport. In an attempt to entice people to use the bus system, all routes were zero-fare {{until the end of}} 2008. The four routes, which operate between 6am and midnight every day, run at a frequency of 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E

(The School of Aviation Medicine had been re-designated as the School of Aerospace Medicine on 8 May 1961.) However, the Medical Service School at Gunter AFB, Alabama remained in the command, reassigned from the medical center to Headquarters ATC on 1 October.|$|E

25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than}} a trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be much easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|At Final Resolution, Nash and {{his partner}} Samoa Joe lost in a title match to TNA World Tag Team Champions A.J. Styles and Tomko after Nash {{abandoned}} and seemingly betrayed Joe. Yet on the following Impact, when Joe stormed into Nash's locker room looking for a fight, Nash was actually able to persuade Joe into accepting his Machiavellian mentorship. Nash lost to Kurt Angle in a one-on-one match on Impact! with the winner qualifying for the Three Ways to Glory match at No Surrender. On the September 11 episode of Impact, prior to No Surrender, he seemingly parted ways with Joe on good terms. One month later, Nash returned at Bound for Glory IV and in a swerve, struck Joe {{in the back with}} Sting's bat, helping Sting win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel once again in the process. On October 23, he formally joined Sting, Booker T, and Kurt Angle to create a villainous stable called The Main Event Mafia. He explained that he never forgave Joe for his scathing comments directed at his best friend Scott Hall's no-show almost a year prior, and befriending him <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of a long term plan to screw him out of the title. He then went on to defeat Joe at Turning Point. Nash, however, was removed from the card for Genesis due to a staph infection, and was replaced by Cute Kip. Nash returned on the January 29 episode of Impact! when the Main Event Mafia took over the show. On Impact! on April 23, he began an on-screen relationship with Jenna Morasca, who subsequently began acting as his valet. At Slammiversary, he was reunited with Joe and helped Angle win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

500|$|Many did {{not enjoy}} the {{addition}} of the McFlurry dessert in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] as many believed it was product placement. Though, Advertising Age reported that McDonald's did not pay to have their dessert in the episode, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of the script. Fey also denied the product placement allegations. She said that the show did not receive money and worried that the McDonald's Corporation might sue them. A McDonald's commercial that appeared within the half-hour was [...] "part of our traditional media buy" [...] and that no advertising [...] "was moved around specifically to be near" [...] the [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] airing, explained Jennifer Lane Landolt, director-entertainment alliances for McDonald's.|$|E
500|$|In early 1922, Lloyd {{moved in}} with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she {{appeared}} at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang [...] "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". [...] Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. [...] Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of the act. [...] A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. [...] She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. [...] More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12October 1922. [...] Lloyd was penniless {{at the time of her}} death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.|$|E
500|$|Jim awakes in {{a secret}} {{detention}} facility under Epcot's Spaceship Earth, where he sees video screens displaying pictures of the woman he imagined on the Soarin' ride and other images of events that happened earlier. A scientist enters and activates a Spaceship Earth resembling helmet, which covers Jim's head and scans him while images of what the scientist refers to as [...] "the real Jim" [...] appear on the screens, being himself dressed differently and apparently part of another family. The scientist discusses Jim's flights of fantasy and imagination and reveals that {{he is part of}} the experiment by the Siemens Corporation ever since he first went to the theme park as a child with his father. His boss is in on the conspiracy and his firing <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of the plan, and so was the closure of the Buzz Lightyear ride just as he and Elliot approached the boarding area, much to Elliot's distress. The scientist also tells Jim that he had turned in Elliot to them, like Jim's father had done to him as a child.|$|E

500|$|The idea {{of having}} Lisa fight the pterodactyl, named Myfanwy by the producers, made them laugh, and felt they had to include it. The line where Ianto calls Jack the [...] "biggest monster" [...] was {{intended}} to be cut out, but Chibnall decided to keep it because of its impact to the audience. The scene where the team lines up to execute Lisa towards the end was the first scene Chibnall had in mind for the episode, though in the first draft, it was Ianto who killed her. After the episode was written and filmed, Chibnall discovered two main plot holes in the story. The first is that he did not make clear that everything about Lisa, including the scene where she acted human <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of her plan for her Cyberman-influence to take over, and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly. The second was Jack having a cut lip in the end, even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly. In the audio commentary for the episode, both Chibnall and actor Gareth David-Lloyd stated the reasoning behind the cut being there is because Jack's immortal powers would only deal with life-threatening wounds and not minor injuries.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{restrictions}} on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool {{announced plans to}} move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002. Planning permission was granted in July 2004, and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a 999-year lease on the proposed site. Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with HKS, Inc. contracted to build the stadium. Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300million needed for the development. In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. [...] As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m. When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jurgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as [...] "impressive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "An Autobiographical Sketch", {{written in}} 1879, Verdi {{tells the story}} of how he came to be twice persuaded by Merelli to change his mind and to write the opera.

[...] However, in Volere è potere ("Where there's a will...")– written ten years closer to the event– Michele Lessona provides a l different account of the events, as allegedly recounted by Verdi himself.|$|E
