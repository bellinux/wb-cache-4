5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E

He stated that the acting white attitude developed as the creation of an [...] "Other" [...] among newly integrated African-American kids.|$|E

2500|$|Pekar {{said that}} for {{the first few years of}} his life, he didn't have friends. The {{neighborhood}} he lived in had once been all white but became mostly black by the 1940s; as one of the only <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> still living there Pekar was often beaten up. He later believed this instilled in him [...] "a profound sense of inferiority." [...] However, this experience also taught him to eventually become a [...] "respected street scrapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{student of}} the {{pioneering}} theoretical art historian, Rosalind E.

One of the few <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> in his low-income housing project on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Berger grew up hyper-sensitized to race. Due to his experiences, he looked beyond the world of [...] "critical theory" [...] to address the relevance of visual culture, and especially images of race, to everyday life.|$|E

2500|$|Blackboard Jungle (1955) was a {{landmark}} film of teen angst. [...] Unlike the comparatively white-bread Rebel Without A Cause and The Wild One, Blackboard Jungle tackled racial conflicts head-on as Ford played an idealistic but harassed teacher {{of an urban}} high school that included a very young Sidney Poitier and other black and Hispanic cast members. Messed-up <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> were there, too, particularly one played by Vic Morrow, depicting that new phenomenon, the juvenile delinquent. [...] Bill Haley's [...] "Rock Around The Clock" [...] under the opening credits was the first use of a rock and roll song in a Hollywood film. Richard Brooks, the film's writer and director, [...] had discovered the music when he heard Ford's son, Peter, playing the record at Glenn's home.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2012, Mundine {{questioned}} former opponent WBA/IBF champion Daniel Geale's indigenous Tasmanian heritage {{saying he}} should not wear the Australian Aboriginal Flag on his shorts. [...] "I thought they wiped all the Aborigines from Tasmania out ... He's got a white woman, he's got <b>white</b> <b>kids.</b> I keep it real, all day every day." [...] Mundine said. When asked whether Geale deserved to sport the Aboriginal flag on his trunks, Mundine responded: [...] "No." [...] Mundine later apologised to Tasmanian Aborigines, adding that he felt many people claimed indigenous heritage {{in order to receive}} government benefits but had no real connection with their Aboriginal roots. He also claimed that Australia was one of [...] "the most racist nations in the world" [...] before calling for the Australian anthem and Australian flag to be changed to be more inclusive of indigenous Australians.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{or not it}} was justified, {{the fact}} remains that {{distrust}} of Presley was common amongst the general African-American population after the accusations of racism were made public. According to George Plasketes, several songs by other performers came out after the singer's death which are a part of a [...] "demystification process as they portray Elvis as a racist". In his book, Colored White: Transcending the Racial Past, David Roediger considers contemporary [...] "wiggers" [...] (<b>white</b> <b>kids</b> [...] "acting Black") in light of the tensions in racial impersonation embodied by Elvis Presley. Chuck D and others have at one point or another publicly condemned Presley for [...] "stealing" [...] black music. However, in 2002, Chuck D, {{in an interview with the}} Associated Press in connection with the 25th Anniversary of Presley's death, explained how his feelings for Elvis' legacy were no longer those as originally suggested by the lyrics in [...] "Fight The Power", a song which he had written 12 years earlier. When [...] broadcast as a part of the NBC-produced documentary [...] "Elvis Lives", [...] Chuck D had the following to say about Presley. [...] "Elvis was a brilliant artist. As a musicologist—and I consider myself one—there was always a great deal of respect for Elvis, especially during his Sun sessions. As a black person, we all knew that. (In fact), Eminem is the new Elvis because, number one, he had the respect for black music that Elvis had".|$|E

He had under-waistcoats, many splendid rings, jewelled pins and neck-chains. When {{he took out his}} yellow pocket-handkerchief with his hand that was cased in <b>white</b> <b>kids,</b> a delightful odour of musk and bergamot was shaken through the house.

6000|$|It {{would have}} been {{impossible}} for the primmest, the sourest, or the most sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a pretty sight. The long train, the big chignon, the apology for a bonnet, were all ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and a happy heart made even those absurdities charming. The erect young figure gave an air to the crisp folds of the delicate dress; the bright eyes and fresh cheeks under the lace rosette made one forget its size; and the rippling brown hair won admiration in spite of the ugly bunch which disfigured the girl's head. The little jacket set [...] "divinely," [...] the new gloves were as immaculate as <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> could be, and to crown all, Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kitty the blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself.|$|E
60|$|To my surprise, {{there were}} TWO ladies in the coach with my friend, and not ONE, as I had expected.

I {{could see a}} gleam of curl-papers over a sallow face,--of a dusky nightcap flapping over the curl-papers,--but these were hidden by a lace veil and a huge velvet bonnet, of which the crowning birds-of-paradise were evidently in a moulting state. She was encased in many shawls and wrappers; she put, hesitatingly, a pretty little foot out of the carriage--Pogson was by her side in an instant, and, gallantly putting one of his <b>white</b> <b>kids</b> round her waist, aided this interesting creature to descend. I saw, by her walk, that she was five-and-forty, and that my little Pogson was a lost man.|$|E
