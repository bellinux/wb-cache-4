5000|$|From John Gibson Lockhart -He was, moreover, unfortunate {{in having}} for his tutor a Mr. Wilder, noted for savage temper, {{who had the}} ungenerosity to treat {{students}} of the subordinate class with peculiar harshness. Wilder might, perhaps, have treated Oliver better, had his turn been for mathematics and the scholastic logic, in which alone he himself excelled and delighted: but Oliver never concealed his dislike of these studies, and for his proficiency, to whatever it may have amounted, in the ancient languages and their elegant literature, the tutor cared little or nothing ... The youthful sizar was a poet, and we need not doubt that his passions at this period fermented with sufficient commotion. His father died before he had been two years in college, and from that time, though he received occasional supplies from his uncle Contarine, according to the statement of a companion, [...] "his poverty was generally squalid." ...The registers of Trinity furnish evidence of many irregularities; and among the rest Goldsmith figures as aiding and abetting a riot of May, 1747, which began with pumping a bailiff at the college cistern — and ended with the students heading the rabble of the town {{in an attempt to}} force Newgate and liberate the prisoners. This frolic was a very serious one — the gaoler fired, and three were killed and several wounded. Five of the gowned ringleaders were expelled, and Goldsmith and four others were ordered to be admonished [...] "Quod seditioni favissent et tumultuantibus opem tulissent."In the month after this, Oliver, anxious to recover his ground, made a considerable exertion, stood for one of Erasmus Smith's exhibitions, for which, though then producing only thirty shillings a-year, there were numerous competitors, and acquitted himself at the examination so well as to attain his object. Elated with this first and last of his academical distinctions, he invited a party of young people of both sexes to a supper and dance in his chambers. Mr. Wilder, astounded with the noise of the unlawful fiddle, entered the room, expostulated warmly with Goldsmith, and probably receiving an intemperate answer, struck him. Upon his sensitive spirit this unwarrantable violence produced a violent effect. After brooding all night over his disgrace, he sold off his books and quit the university, resolving to embark for America, and never revisit Ireland until he had made a character and fortune for himself in another region. He loitered about Dublin, however, until he had just one shilling left, and then set out for Cork. On this shilling he supported himself, by his own account, for three days, and then, having sold most of his raiment, was reduced to such extremity, that [...] "after fasting twenty-four hours, he thought a handful of grey peas, given him by a girl at a wake, the most comfortable repast he had ever made." [...] Fatigue and famine did <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> probably have attempted in vain. Reaching the neighbourhood of his brother Henry, he sent him notice of his plight — was kindly received, re-clothed — and at length carried back to college, where his brother effected [...] "a sort of reconciliation" [...] between him and his tutor.|$|E

Interview participants were asked to reflect upon their work-related experience with cancer by answering two specific questions: (1) <b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give someone who has been newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer? (2) <b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give to employers of these people? Data were gathered through 10 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with HNC clinic patients at a regional cancer center's head and neck clinic in Ontario, Canada. A constant comparative method of theme development was used. Codes identified in and derived from the data were discussed by research team members until consensus was reached. Codes with similar characteristics were grouped together and used to develop overarching themes. Work-related advice for peers focused on personal self-care and interactions within workplaces. Work-related advice to employers focused on demonstrating basic human values as well as the importance of communication. The study results suggest HNC clinic patients should be proactive with employers and help to set reasonable expectations and provide a realistic plan for work to be successfully completed. HNC clinic patients should develop communication skills to effectively disclose their cancer and treatment to employers. In this exploratory study, HNC clinic patients' advice was solution-focused underscoring the importance of self-care and pro-active communication and planning with employers.

40|$|Genomics in 2011 : {{challenges}} and opportunities As {{we come to the}} end of 2011, Genome Biology has asked some members of our Editorial Board for their views on the state of play in genomics. What was their favorite paper of 2011 ? What are the challenges in their particular research area? Who has had the biggest influence on their careers? <b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> they give to young researchers embarking on a career in research? What in your opinion was the most important paper published in your field in the past year? DA: I have a relatively broad area of scientific interest encompassing cancer genetics, mouse genetics and genome sequencing. With my cancer hat on, the paper that impressed me most was by Sodir et al. [1], which showed that inhibition of Myc can cause cancer regression even in advanced tumors. This work illustrates the critical role that Myc plays in tumorigenesis, and clearly defines it as a therapeutic target. In terms of genome sequencing, I’m very impressed by some of the new de novo assembly algorithms, such as Li et al. [2], and I think our contribution of sequencing mouse genomes, Keane et al. [3], is also important and will be of great use to the mouse genetics community. These sequences now make it possible to take a systems biology approach to mouse genetics and to link variants to phenotypes like never before. BB: I would say the Foldit paper by David Baker’s group [4] because it shows a new model of research is possible. Some large-scale problems such as protein folding remain challenging to solve with just computational approaches, and the problem is too difficult for even experts to solve manually. However, by designing tools that can break such problems into puzzles that people, even non-experts, can play with in their spare time can provide cutting-edge solutions [5]. OH: In cancer genetics, two studies struck me this year. The first is the discovery and analysis of chromothripsis by Peter Campbell at the Sanger Institute [6]. This idea that some of the complex chromosomal rearrangements observed in cancer cells can come from a single catastrophic event, where an entire chromosome gets shattered and stuck back together at random, i...|$|E

An extensive review of the published research on child refugees in the Unitd States described specific international treaties, federal statutes, and state codes, addressed developmental disruptions as refugee children experience them, and explored the school experience of specific refugee cultural groups, yet revealed few reports of practitioners’ perspectives. Accordingly, this investigation sought the views of ten school and community professionals who engage with child refugees in a medium-sized, suburban school district to determine 1) <b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> they offer to those who will serve refugee children in public schools? 2) How useful do they find background information on legal mandates and the refugee child’s experience prior to resettlement, and when is this information most beneficial? 3) How do they experience a child refugee’s developmental disruptions, and how do they prioritize work on these disruptions? A one hour semi-structured interview addressed knowledge, skills, and practices that professionals found to be successful when working with a refugee population, along with barriers that they encountered. A three-part, twenty-six item follow-up survey asked participants to provide background information on their experiences, rate their knowledge of federal and state legal mandates and refugee cultural experiences (e. g., home country context, refugee camp conditions), and identify any developmental disruptions a refugee child presented in their setting. Participants reported successes and barriers that were largely role specific. Several themes, however, arose across all interviews. These themes included: 1) addressing students’ language needs, 2) engaging community resources, 3) addressing school needs related to cultural context education, 4) building relational trust, 5) identifying and addressing bullying, and 6) collaborating in pursuit of common professional goals. In addition, interviewees identified motivation and transformation as personal experiences in their work with child refugees.

40|$|Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) - 1 Cue: Foot and Mouth {{disease is}} one of the most devastating of {{livestock}} diseases, not primarily because of the health risk it poses to animals, but because of the economic losses that occur when outbreaks happen. Areas that see Foot and Mouth outbreaks are unable to trade any livestock or livestock products until the disease is controlled, causing much financial hardship to farmers. In order to limit the size of outbreaks, early detection of the disease and quick notification of the veterinary authorities are both essential. For this reason it is vital that farmers are aware of the signs of the disease, and are constantly on the lookout. In our next report, Sylvia Jiyane finds out more about how farmers and veterinary services must work in partnership so that outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease can be tackled quickly and effectively. IN:		?Good livestock management relies ? OUT:		?Matabeleland North province of Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that report was from Sylvia Jiyane. Transcript Jiyane	Good livestock management relies heavily on disease control, and in our discussion today we shall be talking about Foot and Mouth disease. In our programme today I shall be talking to Dr Ndabezinhle Mkhwananzi, a government veterinary officer from Matabeleland North province in Bulawayo. He is going to start off by giving us a definition of the disease. Mkhwananzi	Foot and Mouth disease is a highly contagious specified, or notifiable disease, which causes blisters in the mouth and on the feet of cattle. In fact all cloven hoofed animals ? pigs, sheep and goats, as well as the wildlife like kudus and impalas. Jiyane	And what are some of the key signs and symptoms of this disease? Mkhwananzi	Blisters develop in the mouth and between the claws of the hooves. The blisters contain a clear fluid. In time the blisters will burst, and what will be left there is raw skin sores, which will be sore and the animal will not be able to walk; it will become lame. And it won?t even be able to eat. Jiyane	And Dr Mkhwananzi, if a farmer notices some of those symptoms which you have mentioned, what should he or she do? Mkhwananzi	As I mentioned earlier, this is a notifiable disease. By law, if a farmer suspects his cow has got Foot and Mouth, he has to report to the Department of Veterinary Services, whereby in hours the Veterinary Department will quickly go there and confirm the symptoms, whether they are Foot and Mouth or not. Jiyane	And is this disease one that can be treated? Mkhwananzi	There is no treatment for Foot and Mouth disease. So the major thing is to control the outbreak of the disease. Jiyane	And what are some of these measures? Mkhwananzi	If the Department of Veterinary Services confirms that this is a suspicious case of Foot and Mouth, we will quickly put the area under quarantine. In fact this is the most important disease as far as the Department of Veterinary Services is concerned, not in terms of deaths and so forth, but the economic implications. So, people have to be on the look out for the disease and report it early enough. We put the place under quarantine, carry out vaccination campaigns. Then, after some time we go and investigate whether the disease is still there or not. Afterwards we shall then lift the quarantine. Jiyane	For how long will you quarantine animals in relation to this disease? Mkhwananzi	The initial quarantine will be thirty days. Jiyane	And you have just mentioned earlier on that this disease is of economic importance. Can you clarify that? Mkhwananzi	Right, when there is an outbreak of Foot and Mouth, no trade is supposed to take place. No animals are supposed to go for slaughter, or the milk to the dairy market and so forth. So it affects the economic activity relating to livestock. Jiyane	And for farmers listening right now, <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give them from your own experience of this disease? Mkhwananzi	The main thing is to adhere to control measures, like movement of animals. They should come to the department for any movement of animals, say for distances of 5 kilometres or above, whereby they are issued with a permit, a movement permit. And inspections are carried out, to ascertain whether the animal has got any signs of Foot and Mouth or not. That will control the spread of the disease, and also the farmers are not inconvenienced when we put much stronger measures like quarantine and so forth. Jiyane	And just to take you back, you mentioned that this disease also affects wildlife. Is there any way in which the Veterinary Department is involved in the control of spread of that disease in wildlife areas? Mkhwananzi	The buffalo is taken to be the reservoir of the disease, that is, the carrier. The buffalo itself doesn?t get sick of Foot and Mouth; it carries the disease. So we prevent any contact between livestock, that is domestic livestock such as cattle, with the buffalo. All buffalo should be reported if they are sighted, so that the department will go and control them by culling. That is what we do.

40|$|Beeswax {{candles and}} creams Cue: Livestock such as cattle provide {{a wide range}} of products: meat, milk, hides, manure and labour. Bees may be a much smaller animal, but they also provide an {{impressive}} range of products. The most obvious is honey, but there are several others, including beeswax and Royal Jelly. Bees produce the beeswax in order to construct the honeycomb. Once a bee-keeper has extracted the honey from the comb, this can be melted into a lump of wax, which has many potential uses. As such, beeswax may be a useful source of extra income for bee-keepers. In The Gambia the National Beekeepers? Association {{is at the heart of}} the country?s bee-keeping activities. Beekeepers bring their honey and other bee products to the Association for them to be sold, or used in making value added products. Ismaila Senghore recently visited the Association?s headquarters, located on a busy road in the capital Banjul, to find out more about the value of these bee by-products. IN:		?I am right here at the National ? OUT:		?to you. Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 37 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Ismaila Senghore reporting from Banjul in The Gambia. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Senghore	I am right here at the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia, right in their warehouse where they have the activities of processing of honey going on. And of course we have other by-products also from honey production, that is the wax, like candles, body creams and a lot more. But I have with me here Mr Ebrima Sanyang who is the processing officer of the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is going to tell me exactly how they manage to get the wax in the first place, and what they make out of this wax as by-products which are also meant for the market. Sanyang	Thank you Mr Senghore I am here to give you the view points of the by-products that we have in office here. After extracting out of the honey you put it in a container whereby you can melt it and then produce the wax alone with the bad elements out of it. Then from there you reprocess it again for it to be more clean than before, refining it with coke which will make it cleaner than before. Then you can start to make what you are going to make out of it. Senghore	Now what are the kinds of commodities that you get out of the wax in that form? Sanyang	You can make candles, body cream, wood polish, soap, cosmetics possibly. Senghore	Alright now let?s say if you look at the products that you make, like the ones on display here, the body creams, how do you go about making the body cream for example? Can you explain briefly? Sanyang	Yes ok making body cream you have a certain measurement of the products you are going to use. For the wax itself there is a measurement which is one tea cup full of wax and then you can buy your oil, this vegetable oil, two cups measured in it, put it in the wax, melt it with other products like mentholator or this Karit‚ cream, you add there too to make it soft. Senghore	Ok now let?s talk about the candles, how do you go about making the candles? Sanyang	You are going to break the wax into pieces or into particles, whereby you melt it. And then the other chemical you are going to put inside for it to absorb fire easily is paraffin, which is not available in time. But what we do is we buy these candles from the shops, break it into pieces, melt it together with the wax so that the paraffin inside that candle can be mixed up with the wax to absorb fire easily. Senghore	Now do you make enough for the market, in other words is the demand very high? Sanyang	Well the demand is not so high because we Africans we are not adopting this type of system of candles. But let?s say the whites who always come, sometimes they make a lot of demand, whereby I make it for them, then sell it to them for their own use. Senghore	Finally Mr Sanyang would you say this kind of activity, processing of commodities from wax honey by-products, can be something that can be sustainable amongst your members, like for example they can go and do it on their own even if you are not around? Sanyang	Yes, some of them they do make it because when I am away, sometimes I meet up with others who are making it, and then some comes to my centre to buy wax for making body creams and the likes. Senghore	Therefore <b>what</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give to anybody who is planning to go into the processing of such by-products? What kind of advice do you think will be useful to them so they will make successful enterprises like this? Sanyang	Yes, I thought that before you start on the process you have to find all your necessary equipments whereby your work will be easy without any other problem. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Ebrima Sanyang. That was Mr Ebrima Sanyang talking to me about the processing of wax into commodities that are useable by the local markets and of course by tourists coming here in The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is the Processing Officer of the National Beekeeper?s Association of the Gambia. Mr Sanyang it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

40|$|Certification - a {{difficult}} process? Cue: The majority of farmers in Malawi, like some {{other parts of}} Africa, do not use chemical fertilizers or pesticides on their crops - for many these chemical inputs are simply too expensive. In theory then, these farmers are growing their crops organically; could there be chance that they could sell them at high prices on international markets? Unfortunately, {{it is not so}} simple. Farm produce can only be sold as ?organic? if the farm owner has obtained a certificate which guarantees its organic quality. And as our next report shows, obtaining such a certificate can be an expensive and difficult task. To {{find out more about the}} certification process, Patrick Mphaka visited an organic farm in Zomba district. The farm has been producing certified organic produce for about six years. He sent us this report. IN:		?Many farmers in Malawi ? OUT:		? reached that ten year stage yet. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report was from Patrick Mphaka in Zomba district, Malawi. Transcript Mphaka	Many farmers in Malawi can claim to be organic farmers. Unfortunately only a handful of them are certified as such. The process of becoming certified is too costly for the smallholder farmer. Even more there are other issues that such categories of farmers cannot easily fulfil. It is therefore not surprising to find that there is literally no single smallholder farmer who is certified. To achieve organic status is no easy task. To be able to sell commodities organically into the world market place, each grower must be certified annually, by an internationally credited agency. One of the few certified organic enterprises one may come across in the country is Gattina estate, located in Zomba district. During my visit to the estate recently, I had a chat with its owner, Mr. Arthur Stevens. What actually do they look for to certify one as an organic farmer? Stevens	The organics inspectors are looking for a range of things: obviously growing your crops without pesticides and fertilizers. But the whole thing is much bigger and wider than that; probably more important as well, is your methods of growing, which include your rotation systems, improving the soil, encouraging a lot of the natural habitat to come back. The whole aim of all these farming practices is to restore and sustain the soil for the future. Mphaka	Most Malawian smallholder farmers use neither fertilizers nor pesticides. Would we classify those as organic farmers to some extent? Stevens	To some extent, yes they are organic farmers, but they are not certified organic farmers, so that means that they will not be able to sell their product in overseas markets as organic. This is because of the very strict classification system and methods used for organic growing. But of course, yes, they are by definition effectively growing organically, from the point of view of no pesticides and no fertilizers. But unfortunately they are not fulfilling the wider range of organic farming principles, such as the rotations and the composting and the biodiversity, which can be expanded upon by a lot of our smallholder farmers here. Mphaka	<b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give Malawian smallholder farmers, should they try to become organic farmers? Stevens	I think for smallholder farmers it would be very difficult for them to become certified, because of the very strict restrictions that are part of the organic certifying process. It is not just about the actual methods of farming, but also the record keeping and the volumes that are required to actually access international markets. The record keeping is very very strict. You have to fully keep records of all your past activities on the farm, plus produce projections for the next five years, areas to be grown, expected yields etc. That is number one area. The second area is actually the volume that can be produced by an individual farmer is not sufficient to be able to access easily international markets, so that means that smallholder farmers, if they were interested in getting into this, would need to get together in a group, and by a group I mean a contiguous group, so that means you have to have the entire smallholder village and all their fields certified. You can?t have one in the middle who isn?t because again, one of the organic principles is that organic certified land must be separated by ten metres, minimum, from land that is not certified as organic. This means that with a lot of the smallholding pattern that we have here, if you had a smallholder farmer in the middle, who was not organic, and who refused to be organic, he would impinge on his neighbours very greatly, because the separation between their fields is less that ten metres. Mphaka	Having undergone all those processes would you say that becoming an organic farmer is worth it? Stevens	It is worth it from my perspective, of feeling that I am going about my farming production in a way that is beneficial to the planet, if that is not a trite way of putting it. But it is very definitely a ?feel-good? factor, that I?m not polluting the farm, I?m not draining its resources. What I?m doing is I?m preserving them and I?m enhancing them. So from that angle it is very satisfying. From the point of view of whether you are going to get rich and make money quickly, no, it is not [worth it], certainly not in the short term. Anybody who goes into organic farming must go into it with their eyes fully wide open and realise to begin with they are going to be spending a lot of money on a lot of research, make a lot of mistakes learning how to do this, and eventually they will probably come to the stage where they are breaking even, carrying costs, and then maybe ten years down the line, maybe then at that stage they might be actually making some money. And I would say that I have not reached that ten year stage yet. End of track.

Especially {{if they are}} full of young indigenous or local fruit trees with all that potential to provide nutritious fruits as well as additional income to farming families. But if the nurseries are far away from where farmers live there is little {{hope that they will}} get the chance to buy good seedlings for planting. This is why the World Agroforestry Centre ? known as ICRAF ? is recruiting and encouraging farmers to set up tree nurseries in their communities. In Kenya, Jonathan Muriuki from ICRAF has been training these nursery farmers to cultivate local varieties of tamarind, for example. Eric Kadenge went to meet him {{to find out how to}} make a successful business of a community tree nursery. And, most importantly, to ask how much of a market there is these days for seedlings of local trees? IN:	?Unlike crops people don?t buy seeds of trees [...] . OUT:	?depending on your nursery entirely. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Suggested BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sounds like there is money to be made in tree seedlings, not to mention the income from sales of the fruits/nuts of the mature trees. Jonathan Muriuki was talking with Eric Kadenge. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Muriuki	Unlike crops people don?t buy seeds of trees. They normally want to buy seedlings because their planting programmes are smaller, especially for the small-scale farmers. And the nearer the nursery is to the farmer the better. We would rather farmers have their own nurseries where farmers can easily come and buy from the nurseries that are close to them. That is the purpose of setting up these nurseries. Kadenge	So you believe that is better of them to have and to own and to run these nurseries? Muriuki	Yes that is the best thing to do because farmers are not going to go a long distance to get seedlings and when the rains come farmers are busy doing very many things. So the nearer the nursery, then the better for them to plant trees. Kadenge	When it comes to decision making about issues regarding a nursery, do they do it on their own, or are you involved in that? Muriuki	Farmers make decisions on their own in setting up their nurseries. But however sometimes other organisations like the Ministry of Agriculture, Kenya Forest Service, they sometimes consult with farmers and guide them on what to do Kadenge	When you talk about what to do I take that to be training? Muriuki	Yes that is training because, if I give an example of this country we have got about 1800 tree species that are indigenous in this country, that means that farmers need to learn a lot of things about every individual tree species that is important to them, so scientists and extensionists have to come and train them on some of these techniques. Kadenge	What are some of the common trees that you are training them on how to build nurseries for? Muriuki	Some of the common trees that we have trained them on how to do nurseries for are most of them are exotic but for the indigenous pieces we have trees like mangoes. Kadenge	<b>What</b> <b>advice</b> <b>would</b> you give to somebody who is listening to this programme, for example through radio on how to set up their own nursery? Muriuki	One, it is very important that you have a permanent source of water. That can be a permanent river or it can be a tap, piped water or anything but as long as you are going to set up a nursery water is going to be very critical, it as going to be a day to day affair. We have seen many nurseries that have shut down because they could have water to sustain them. Unfortunately for most of the areas, water becomes scarce when the nursery needs it most, so having a permanent source of water is very important. It is also very important to know where you can be able get a rich soil. That is rich in organic matter because that is what the seedling is going to be depending on for the next three, four or six months that it is going to be in the nursery. So if you are near a forest then you can collect the soil from the forest, if you are not near a forest then you can collect organic matter from elsewhere and make compost, which then is going to mixed up in the soil that you have. It is also good to ensure that you have about a quarter of an acre to half and acre where you are going to set up your own nursery, because you need structures in there: a place where you will be having a shed for the seedlings, and a place where you will move them out of the shed, a place where you are going to store your tools that you are working with in the nursery, and a place whereby when people come to buy seedlings or to collect seedlings from you they can stay there because you do not want people moving around your nursery and messing up the seedlings that are there. And also, the hardening. Hardening is moving how you prepare the seeding from coming out of the nursery to the field conditions where it is going to be harsh and it is going to experience conditions that are not as it was in the nursery. So at least a quarter of an acre is important for you. And above all things it should be on a sloping land because some of the water that you will be pouring there should not stall, because if it stores then your seedlings are going to be sick. All the water is supposed to drain. Kadenge	Is this something that they could also do and earn some extra shilling from? Muriuki	Yes as long as you have demand for seedlings. We have done our research and we have seen that farmers can make a lot of money from nurseries. Actually we have seen farmers that are in the cities or in the peri-urban areas of the city, who are completely and entirely relying on the money that comes from nurseries. For the common prices of seedlings that we see, about half of it is profit, that is if you inject faming labour into your nursery. Therefore you can make money on it depending on your nursery entirely. End of track. What to consider when setting up your own nursery...|$|E

We will look at three OA peer-reviewed student journals. For each, we will learn the motivations to create such publications and how faculty advisors and editors determine their audience. Questions will include: breadth (regional, national, international); structure and process of the journal; how editors and peer-reviewers are chosen and their work evaluated; what are the criteria for articles; what is the acceptance rate; what is the peer-edit process; are peer reviewers trained and, if so, how; how much oversight do faculty advisors have; and how much time do student editors and peer reviewers spend per week.
