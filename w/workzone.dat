40|$|The {{increased}} demand {{on the current}} highway system has caused transportation agencies to increase scheduling for nighttime work in order to alleviate daytime work zone congestion, especially during peak traffic hours. Although traffic congestion is reduced, safety in nighttime <b>workzones</b> remains a concern among both transportation agencies and contractors. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), approximately one-half of the fatalities that occurred in <b>workzones</b> nationwide occurred at night. These work zone statistics have received increased attention among agencies to evaluate planning and safety issues concerning the workers {{and the general public}} on nighttime <b>workzones.</b> Four separate, but interrelated research studies were conducted between September 2005 - May 2007 to address safety issues in nighttime construction and maintenance projects on highways in Indiana. The first study investigated owner and contractor safety management planning for nighttime construction and maintenance operations, while the second study investigated traffic control planning and implementation procedures for nighttime construction and maintenance operations. The third study investigated the effectiveness of speed control measures on nighttime construction and maintenance projects and the fourth study evaluated the effectiveness of high-visibility personal protective equipment practices. The safety management practices of the general contractor heavily influence the perception of safety of nighttime construction workers. Workers and general contractors have similar perceptions about the strategies necessary to improve safety on the nighttime construction jobsite. Frequently, the safety threat presented by the general public is cited by nighttime construction and maintenance workers as making them feel unsafe on the jobsite. Methods to raise the awareness of the general public about nighttime construction are needed in order to improve the safety of the nighttime construction and maintenance workers from the dangers imposed by the general public. Traffic control planning by highway agencies and contractors impact the supervisors’ and the workers’ perceptions of safety. The results from the formal interviews with Indiana contractors and Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) personnel indicated that contractors are becoming more involved in traffic control planning. Increased law enforcement and public awareness were among the most important traffic control strategies for improved nighttime safety indicated by the supervisors and the workers. The presence of police enforcement, a high percentage of semi trucks in the traffic, and a high flow rate – all reduced mean speed through nighttime <b>workzones</b> Changeable message signs, while more expensive than work zone speed limit signs, are already being used on many nighttime <b>workzones</b> but were not found to affect mean speeds. Police enforcement was found to reduce mean speeds, was the most expensive method of speed control in the study. The safety garment currently used by the workers of the Indiana Department of Transportation is a yellow-green safety vest with a four-inch wide fluorescent orange strip with two one-inch strips of reflective silver material. The visibility of the safety vest currently used by INDOT can be increased by adding a secondary high-visibility PPE such as safety pants and/or retroreflective bands. Current safety training in personal protective equipment (PPE) is focused on which PPE is applicable for a certain type of job and how to use the PPE. However, training workers how to maintain the PPE will increase its useful life, resulting in savings for the owner and/or the general contractor. In order to improve the visibility of current PPE garments there should be differences in the values of retroreflectivity between the primary and secondary high-visibility PPE and larger variance in the retroreflectivity values across the garment. In addition, the garments should be changed or rotated with other garments periodically to ensure that the attention of drivers is being captured...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To be {{deployed}} in the real world, a self-driving car must be capable of responding to exceptional road conditions, such as temporary work zones, because such events can change previously known traffic rules and road geometry. To develop such a capability, we implemented a computer vision system that recognizes the bounds of highway workzones by detecting regulatory and warning <b>workzone</b> signs. Because it is not prac-tical to expect perfect performance in sign recognition, we also developed a confidence-propagation method to handle potential sign recognition errors. The performance of highway <b>workzone</b> recognition was improved by confidence-propagation, but our approach is not easily scalable to some real-world scenarios. Instead of only propagating sign classification confidence, in this work we project the appearance information of previously detected signs onto the current frame, to constrain the region for searching.

The present study investigated the effects of long contraflow systems (up to 12 km) on lateral position, longitudinal control, speed, road marking crossings, steering performance, workload and subjective evaluation. The study included a driving simulator study, video observations of traffic behavioiu: at contraflow systems, and a study with an instrumented vehicle at prolonged contraflow-systems. [...] The driving simulator study investigated the effect of type of contraflow system, lane width and length of the contraflow system on driving behaviour, workload and subjective safety.

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{transportation}} agencies, the Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO) is also {{using the same}} work zone closure strategies and standards that it has used for decades. However, the lane closure strategies should incorporate the impacts of construction duration and inconvenience to the road users and find the balance where users face minimal inconvenience while contractors have the appropriate {{amount of time to}} finish the work and produce a high quality product. In-order to evaluate and assess the appropriate time for lane closures, it is important to estimate the capacity of the lanes. The capacity estimates can help in determining the optimized time for lane closures to minimize the user delays while providing sufficient time for contractors to achieve the desired productivity and quality of work. There are different models, computer Software and wide variety of studies to evaluate and estimate the <b>Workzone</b> Capacity and associated User Delay Costs at workzones. These costs are primarily affected by traffic flows, vehicle speeds, and work zone capacities. In-view of the above, this study is designed to estimate freeway capacity of construction workzones and discuss the associated user delay costs and economic issues. For this study, the capacity at the work zones was measured as the mean queue discharge flow rate during forced-flow conditions. Forced-flow conditions were defined as congested conditions during which a sustained queue formed. There are several studies and approaches for collecting traffic volume data for estimating <b>workzone</b> capacity. For this study, it was decided to utilize a manual counting method for volume data. This would help provide the visual confirmation of queuing and intensity of work activity at workzones.

40|$|Managing {{traffic in}} workzones {{presents}} significant mobility and safety challenges for agencies. The goals of a <b>workzone</b> traffic management plan are to safely slow vehicles {{ahead of the}} <b>workzone,</b> maintain speeds that provide {{for the safety of}} motorists and construction workers, and manage the growth of queues. Variable speed limits have historically been presented as a technology that can dynamically regulate speed in response to prevailing traffic conditions. However, techniques used to evaluate the impact of variable speed limits typically use aggregated statistics such as mean and standard deviation to determine the “typical” speed reduction. This paper presents a new methodology to evaluate the impact of variable speed limit signage based on individual vehicle-matching. The speeds and speed changes of these matched vehicles were used to analyze individual driver response to the variable speed limits. This allows agencies to understand the impact variable speed limit signage has on the distribution of vehicle speeds. It was concluded that vehicles need to observe multiple signs prior to any tangible reduction in speed limit.

From a large database of detailed loop detection data the most likely demand profiles are estimated for the considered <b>workzone</b> location, taking into account the possible effects of mobility management.

An effective approach, which is quickly spreading at international level, is the <b>workzone</b> safety audit. Road safety audit is a formal examination {{of a future}} road or traffic project, an existing road, or any project which interacts with road users, where an independent, qualified team reports on the project’s potential accident and safety performance, by trying to investigate how the road environment is perceived, and ultimately utilised by different road users.

New risk indicators, that involve the prediction of the number and severity of potential accidents associated with each safety item, have been defined: the Total Weighted Score of the main safety aspects, which relates to the risk factors {{that may be improved}} by engineering measures, and the Global Safety Index, which allows the evaluation of the global safety of the <b>workzone</b> and the ranking of workzones in the road network. The proposed safety evaluation procedure is strongly related to the safety consequences of the identified problems, rather than on the standard non-compliance or on the number of deficiencies.

40|$|As {{the trend}} of {{increased}} highway construction and/or rehabilitation continues to grow, the public often demands that delays in work zones be kept to a minimum. Thus, the flow of traffic through the construction zone must be maintained while performing pavement maintenance/ repair/ reconstruction activities. At the same time, the safety of personnel and property in highway construction work zones must be ensured. Three types of risks are encountered by construction and maintenance workers in construction workzones: (a) risks due to underprotection or lack of protection against potential hazards (including lack of hearing protection, eye protection, respiratory protection); (b) effect of speeding through workzones, and (c) impacts {{due to the lack}} of/inadequate visibility issues (both workers and motorists). This report presents the findings of three separate, yet interrelated projects that explored the hazards in highway construction and maintenance workzones, and evaluated <b>workzone</b> safety strategies.

40|$|The {{positive}} {{impacts of}} platooning on travel time reliability, congestion, emissions, and energy consumption {{have been shown}} for homogeneous roadway segments. However, speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation network, due to either safety-related considerations (e. g., <b>workzone</b> operations) or congestion management schemes (e. g., speed harmonization systems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shock- wave formation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a platooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to enabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a generalized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring safety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural error terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system, which is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the case when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the minimum safe distance between them. In this way, we change the tracking velocity profile problem into a state- feedback stabilization problem {{with respect to the}} target curve. Under certain mild assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the speed drop profile, we show that the stabilizing feedback can be obtained via introducing a natural dynamics for the maximum of the error terms for each vehicle. Moreover, we show that with this stabilizing feedback collisions will not occur if the initial state of the system of vehicles is sufficiently close to the target curve. We also show that the error terms remain bounded throughout the time and space. Two scenarios were simulated, with and without initial perturbations, and results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control model in tracking the speed drop while ensuring safety and string stability...|$|E

The shortcomings of traditional valuation methods include the implicit monolithic assumption of asset structures and the parochial range of value-related asset attributes considered in the evaluation process. Thus, this research developed enhanced methods and concepts for valuation. The elemental decomposition and multi-criteria (EDMC) method uses asset component costs, remaining service lives and condition. The replacement-downtime-salvage method considers life-cycle costs, including <b>workzone</b> user costs, and recycling benefits or disposal costs. The decommission-and-reuse method {{is based on the}} real-estate value of land occupied by the asset. The probabilistic method considers the asset value as a function of its survival likelihood. This study determined the total value of Indiana’s state highway assets using traditional and proposed methods and new considerations. For the proposed EDMC method, this estimate was $ 45 billion. The value of pavements and bridges were $ 37. 38 B and $ 3. 40 B, respectively, together constituting 90 % of total asset value. The total value of smaller assets (guardrails, underdrains, culverts, and road signs) was approximately $ 1. 2 B, and rights-of-way, $ 2. 840 B, constituting approximately 3 % and 7 %, respectively of the total asset value.

40|$|The Highway Travel Information System (HTIS) is a {{long-term}} pre-trip information system providing information about expected events, such as road construction. The HTIS can be beneficial to both highway travelers and roadway project schedulers. Project schedulers can use the HTIS to check the forecasted traffic impacts of a proposed construction project schedule. If the schedule would cause unacceptable delays, a scheduler can try new schedules to reduce the delay. Travelers who have flexible schedules {{and would like to}} do pre-trip planning can obtain knowledge of traffic conditions in the near future from HTIS to avoid unnecessary delays. ^ An approach called <b>Workzone</b> Delay Equilibrium Estimation (WDEE) is used by the HTIS to predict traffic conditions as construction zones age. Two extreme values of link volumes are calculated based on two scenarios: “no information”, in which no drivers know about a new road capacity reduction, and “complete information”, in which all drivers have adequate information about road construction zones. A relationship between link volumes and the age of a construction project has been hypothesized and applied to the two extreme cases to estimate link volumes during construction periods. Finally, the expected delays on links under construction are estimated based on the estimated link volumes. ^ The HTIS is divided into three subsystems for the purpose of meeting the needs of different groups of users. They are the modeling, project scheduling, and web access subsystems. The modeling and project scheduling subsystems are for management purposes and the web access subsystem is for use by the traveling public. The main function of the modeling subsystem is to model traffic conditions and generate a delay database. The major tasks for the project scheduling subsystem include schedule database management and assisting project scheduling. With the web access subsystem, travelers may input their proposed departure times and receive information about expected delays at workzones that are expected to be active during their trips. Motorists can use the information to plan their trips up to two months in advance. ...|$|E
40|$|In a bid {{to ensure}} {{cost-effective}} highway construction practices, highway agencies constantly seek ways to accelerate project design and delivery through implementation of innovative contracting and procurement practices. The concept of warranties, {{which is one of}} such promising practices, involves a shift of the burden of construction quality control, product performance and product maintenance from the owner to the contractor. As such, warranty projects are expected to enhance product quality and service life, and ultimately, reduced life-cycle cost. The expected benefits of warranty projects, however, could be offset by their historically higher construction costs. It is therefore necessary to evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} warranty contracts vis-à-vis traditional contracts so that the more cost-effective practice can be identified. The present study reviewed the state of warranty practice in highway pavement construction in Indiana and elsewhere, collects data on warranty and traditional contracts, and carried out statistical analyses to evaluate the relative costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these two alternative contracting practices. Effectiveness was measured in terms of average pavement condition and pavement service life, and costs were expressed in annualized costs per lane-mile. All costs were adjusted for inflation and economy of scale. The study confirmed that the warranty contracts generally have higher agency costs than traditional contracts, but produced pavements that were superior to their traditional counterparts in terms in average pavement condition (rutting, cracking and roughness) and service life. It was determined that the typical projected treatment life of warranty contract pavement was 25 years while similar traditional contract pavements had a service life of 15 years. Also, the average construction period and resulting <b>workzone</b> user costs were lower for warranty contract pavements. The medium-term cost-effectiveness analysis showed that when the analysis is carried out over a relatively short period of 5 -years (the typical warranty period), the warranty pavement contracts are not as cost-effective as their traditional counterparts. However, the long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (which used treatment service life as the analysis period) clearly indicated that the warranty contracts are generally more cost-effective than traditional contracts. The study results suggest that the superiority of warranty projects over traditional projects is more discernible when both cost and effectiveness are viewed over the entire life of the pavement treatment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 4, 2015 - December 4, 2016 Highway capacity has traditionally been treated as deterministic. In reality, however, capacity can vary {{from time to time}} and location to location due to inclement weather, various driving behavior, traffic incident, bottleneck and <b>workzone.</b> This thesis aims to characterize the stochastic variations of highway capacity, and explore its applications. The stochastic variation of highway capacity is captured through a space-time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. It is identified following a Seasonal STARIMA model (0, 0, 2 ₃) × (0, 1, 0) ₂, which indicates that the capacities of adjacent locations are spatially-temporally correlated. Hourly capacity patterns further verify the stochastic nature of highway capacity. The goal of this research is to study (1) how to take advantage of second order information, such as capacity variation, and (2) what benefits can be gained from stochastic capacity modeling. The implication of stochastic capacity is investigated through a ramp metering case study. A mean-standard deviation formulation of capacity is proposed to achieve the trade-off between traffic operation efficiency and robustness. Following that, a modified stochastic capacity-constraint ZONE ramp metering scheme embedded cell transmission model (CTM) algorithm is introduced. The numerical experiment suggests that considering second order information would alleviate the bottleneck effect and improve throughput. Monte Carlo simulation further supports this argument. This study helps verify and characterize the stochastic nature of capacity, validates the benefits of using second order information, and thus enhances the necessity of implementing stochastic capacity in traffic operation. In addition, this thesis presents a multiple days' highway capacity forecasting model and reveals the importance of incorporating capacity randomness separately in short term forecasting. Empirical observations of capacity with variations suggest that the existing deterministic notion of capacity (i. e., a fixed capacity value of 2400 veh/hr/ln) is inadequate to fully describe capacity fluctuations. The goal of this study is to provide insight on forecasting with inherent stochasticity. A hybrid highway capacity forecasting model based on wavelet dynamic neural time series is proposed. Based on 5 -day capacity forecasting results, a 3. 07...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and testing reported in Chapters 4 and 5 and the assessments {{of these results}} in Chapter 6 have confirmed the potential of Epoxy Asphalt and High Performance Cementitious Material for use as long life wearing courses. This chapter examines {{the state of the}} art in production of the material mixes in commercial quantities and potential methods for construction of advanced surfacings using these materials. In doing so, the chapter explores sorne anticipated construction issues and risks, as well as indicative cost estimates for the use of these materials. In relation to construction, consideration needs to be given to a range of factors including; the role and interests of the user agency or owner; the materials involved and their particular needs for processing within a reasonable construction time; transportation; laying procedures; testing for quality and performance; <b>workzone</b> safety and traffic control; and training. Lessons leamed from placement of the materials for the accelerated testing reported in Chapters 4 and 5 can help those responsible, identify with industry the construction issues, risks and processing requirements involved. From an economic perspective, the Phase 1 study highlighted that, for economic viability, long life surfacings would most likely only be viable on highly trafficked roads, would need to have costs within a defined cost envelope (typically around 3 times the cost of conventional wearing surfaces) and would need to be evaluated over the 30 - 40 year project life cycle, using 'reasonable' discount rates (e. g. around 6 per cent). Following the testing undertaken, further consideration needed to be given to indicative costs of the candidate materials, taking into, account the experience gained with the preparation and testing during the Phase II work. Consideration also needed to be given to any health and safety risks associated with use of the candidate materials as well as to environmental aspects including recyclability of the materials at the end of their useful life. These aspects are discussed in sorne detail for Epoxy Asphalt and HPCM in the following individual sections. Aspects common to both Epoxy Asphalt and HPCM are addressed after the individual Epoxy Asphalt and HPCM sections...|$|E
40|$|Maps are {{important}} for both human and robot navigation. Given a route, drivingassistance systems consult maps to guide human drivers to their destinations. Similarly, topological maps of a road network provide a robotic vehicle with information about where it can drive and what driving behaviors it should use. By providing the necessary information about the driving environment, maps simplify both manual and autonomous driving. The majority of existing cartographic databases are built, using manual surveys and operator interactions, to primarily assist human navigation. Hence, the resolution of existing maps is insufficient for use in robotics applications. Also, the coverage of these maps fails to extend to places where robotics applications require detailed geometric information. To augment the resolution and coverage of existing maps, this thesis investigates computer vision algorithms to automatically build lane-level detailed maps of highways and parking lots by analyzing publicly available cartographic resources, such as orthoimagery. Our map-building methods recognize image patterns and objects that are tightly coupled with {{the structure of the}} underlying road network by 1) identifying, without human intervention, locally consistent image cues and 2) linking them based on the obtained local evidence and prior information about roadways. We demonstrate the accuracy of our bootstrapping approach in building lane-level detailed roadwaymaps through experiments. Due to expected abnormal events on highways such as roadwork, the geometry and traffic rules of highways that appear on maps can occasionally change. This thesis also addresses the problem of updating the resulting maps with temporary changes by analyzing perspective imagery acquired from a vision sensor installed on a vehicle. To robustly recognize highway work zones, our sign recognizer focuses on handling variations of signs’ colors and shapes. Sign recognition errors, which are inevitable, can cause our system to misread temporary highway changes. To handle potential errors, our method utilizes the temporal redundancy of sign occurrences and their corresponding classification decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach highway <b>workzone</b> recognition through testing with video data recorded under various weather conditions. Two major results of this thesis work are 1) algorithms that analyze orthoimages to produce lane-level detailed maps of highways and parking lots and 2) on-vehicle computer vision algorithms that are able to recognize temporary changes on highways. Our maps can provide detailed information about a route, in advance, to either a human driver or a self-driving vehicle. While driving on highways, our roadway-assessing algorithms enable the vehicle to update the resulting maps with temporary changes to the route...|$|E
