5000|$|A {{company may}} go into <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> either voluntarily or {{by order of}} the court. [...] A company enters {{voluntary}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> by passing a special resolution to appoint a liquidator.

25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of a <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> For this purpose a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company, or on the presentation of a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R
50|$|In a {{compulsory}} <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the day {{on which}} the relevant Court order is made will constitute {{the date of the}} commencement of the <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b> The date on which the application to <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the company was filed is called the relation-back day.

25|$|During {{the course}} of a <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a company may make an {{estimate}} of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> turns out to be before the actual <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> had started with that accounting period.|$|R

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} (theory) I tried to draw up the legal background of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the commercial company, then I aimed to general aspects of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation (general reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> liquidator, insolvency proceeding), specifics of the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> with liquidation appertaining to particular type of commercial company and finally I described the <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with the legal successor (legal forms of conversions). In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R

50|$|In {{practice}} {{the most important}} grounds tend to be insolvency (the fourth ground) and just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> (the sixth ground). Just and equitable <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is usually unrelated to the solvency of the company.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of concurrent foreign insolvency proceedings. As a foreign company may be wound up in Australia (see Pt 5. 7 and Pt 5 B. 2 of the Corporations Law), a local liquidation may be taking place when {{the company is also}} being wound up in its place of incorporation. If this occurs, the foreign <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> is regarded as the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> and the local one as merely ancillary: Re English Scottish & Australian Chartered Bank [1893] 3 Ch 385. The local ancillary <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> concentrates on getting in and realising local assets and may result in funds being remitted to the principal <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> for distribution. If any issue in the local <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> comes before the local court, it must apply local law, including local insolvency law, to its resolution: Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 10) [1997] Ch 213. ...|$|R

50|$|The House of Lords held clearly {{preferential}} shares {{were not}} debentures, they are equity, because the 5% preference {{would not be}} paid {{if there was no}} profit, whereas a 5% interest rate would have to be. To calculate their entitlement on <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> the court should begin the process of construction with a presumption of equality. Since it was deemed that the provision on 5% extra dividends was exhaustive, and there was no indication this should apply to <b>winding</b> <b>up,</b> there was no automatic right to more preferential distributions on <b>winding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of a {{commercial}} company with liquidation. It consists of two parts [...] theoretical (chapters 2 to 5) and practical (chapter 6). In the theoretical part I start with introduction into the issue (legal background, basic concepts) and then I write about the reasons for <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> {{of a commercial}} company. Furthermore I focus on liquidation, the company liquidator and the liquidation process itself. I also briefly mention the procedure in case of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of an insolvent company. In the practical part I show on {{an example of a}} particular commercial company how would its liquidation look like. We can see what steps the associates and the liquidator have to take between the decision about <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company and its erasure from the Companies register...|$|R
