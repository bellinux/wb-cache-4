40|$|Women seeking {{fertility}} treatment using donor eggs {{can face}} challenges associated with recruiting suitable egg donors and negotiating {{the role that}} the donor may play {{in the life of the}} child. Social work in infertility clinics is an emerging area of practice and social work counsellors have an important role to play with parties involved in the egg donation process. This paper seeks to raise awareness of social work practice with women seeking egg donors, providing an overview of issues for social work practice. Findings from a small practice research project are also presented to highlight the experiences of women advertising for egg donors and to illustrate an empowerment approach to social work practice with these women. It was found that with the support of the social <b>work</b> <b>counsellor,</b> newspaper advertising can be an effective method to recruit egg donors for fertility treatment that allows women control over the process...|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{relationships}} between social <b>work</b> <b>counsellors</b> and clergy members in Prince George, British Columbia, specific to their provision of counselling services. A qualitative research design was implemented, incorporating interviews with social workers, pastoral clergy, and chaplains. Study findings reveal that participants share a counselling context incorporating facets of location, social capital, and practice concerns. Social workers and clergy {{in this study}} note that they have counselling practices in common particularly {{the way that they}} govern their practice and develop relationships with their clients. Some main distinctions emerged as counsellor roles were explored. This study unveils the reality of the relationships occurring across discipline boundaries and delves into the barriers and benefits that influence these relationships. [...] Leaf ii.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} research project explores the significance that individual counsellors attach {{to being an}} ‘only-child’ {{in terms of their}} development in childhood, their adult lives and their <b>work</b> as <b>counsellors.</b> The academic literature tends to deal with {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} growing up without siblings. Yet, for this researcher, these studies seem to diminish the unique lived experience of individuals and almost to perpetuate stereotypes – even when they seek to challenge existing negative stereotypes by positing new, more favourable stereotypes. Four experienced counsellors were interviewed about the impact that being an onlychild has had – and continues to have – on their lives and were invited to reflect on their own reactions to the stereotypes. My research indicates that the stereotypes bear little relation to the lived-experience of the participants. It also concludes that the process of becoming a counsellor has helped the participants to understand the part that being an only-child has played in the complex picture of their overall development. For all participants, this awareness seems to be an important aspect of their <b>work</b> as <b>counsellors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} cleaning {{industry is}} characterized by a high proportion of labour costs and a pronounced comparability and standardization of services. The statistical preconditions for the evaluation have not been ideal which is mainly due to the high proportion of part-time work and mini-jobs. The evaluation is based on a representative company survey, a survey of <b>works</b> <b>counsellors,</b> company case studies and micro-econometric calculations based on SIAB. The lower minimum pay rate for indoor cleaning tends to be the 'going rate' which otherwise might be undercut. Employees' protection has been improved by the more effective controls by the customs which are also assessed as very important for competition. Employment and working time volume have been increasing between 2000 and 2008 and the market share of the commercial cleaning industry has grown compared to cleaners in other industries. The micro-econometric analysis reveals all in all no negative impact on employment and suggests that the inclusion of the industry into the Law on the Posting of Workers (AEntG) might have led to shifts from mini-jobs to employment covered by social security...|$|R

40|$|Many {{waves of}} {{migration}} have shaped the multicultural structure of contemporary society in many countries, including Israel. Israeli society is multifaceted from almost every possible perspective. This diversity, with its implications, {{is expressed in}} all areas of life, including education. The multicultural approach opens a space of respect for all cultures, assuming that as the person as an individual and society as a whole will absorb components from different cultures in it there will be cultural richness. The educational system constitutes a main mechanism through which Israeli society is dealing with this issue. Many counsellors are required to address issues of intercultural encounter during their <b>work.</b> The <b>counsellor’s</b> involvement in this context in the school is expressed in different dimensions: knowledge in the school program and in the degree to which it fits the multiculturalism of the school population, relationship with the school staff about coping with the daily challenges of the intercultural topic, and parent involvement. Counselling in the school has a wide range of actions, including individualized work, group work and community <b>work.</b> The <b>counsellors</b> face many challenges in activity in the multicultural aspect. The school based on active and healthy pedagogical and counselling principles may cause significant community changes outside of its walls. 4041141921 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|R
40|$|Professional Vocational and Career Counsellors prepare {{young people}} for {{integration}} {{into the world of}} <b>work.</b> <b>Counsellors</b> have the duty of guiding these young minds as they struggle to discover their talents, abilities, disabilities, interests, competence and job requirements. To achieve these objectives, counselors work in cooperation with relevant teams in Education, Human Resources and of course in Government at different levels. The discipline known as “Guidance and Counselling” has been introduced in Nigerian Universities since the 1980 s. As my research has revealed however, these Universities (Ibadan, Lagos and Ife) have not undertaken any major revision of their programmes since the subject was first introduced as a major area of study. Rather, their syllabuses are dominated with theories that were first developed in the 1980 s., with little or nothing done to rework the syllabus so as to align them with current demands in vocational counselling. In this paper, I present a comparative analysis of curriculums of three Nigeria Universities and two Universities in Germany, following which I proffer broad suggestions on how to improve on the programmes of study in Nigeria Universities. This, {{in such a way that}} vocational and career counseling will become truly professionalized, with adequate opportunities provided for specialists to discharge their responsibilities fully and effectively...|$|R
