At this point Marwan II mobilized his troops from Harran and {{advanced}} toward Mesopotamia. On January 16, 750 the two forces met on the left bank of {{a tributary of the}} Tigris in the Battle of the Zab, and nine days later Marwan II was defeated and his army was completely destroyed. The battle is regarded as <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> sealed the fate of the Umayyads. All Marwan II could do was flee through Syria and into Egypt, with each Umayyad town surrendering to the Abbasids as they swept through in pursuit.|$|E

This freed up much of Gray's time. Also, late in 1872, Ignatius Sargent, Charles' father, and Horatio Hollis Hunnewell both agreed to donate $500 yearly each to support Gray {{so that he could}} devote [...] "undivided attention" [...] to completing Flora of North America. This is <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> allowed Gray to resign his professorship and devote all his time to research and writing.|$|E

However, music producer Rob Fusari convinced her that a drum machine would not hurt her integrity, telling her that Queen, {{who was one of}} Gaga's musical inspirations, used it in their music. Fusari commented, [...] "I think that's <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> got her to give it a shot, [...] We finished 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' that day. It's one of the songs on her debut album." ...|$|E

By law, {{the tower of}} every parish church had to hold equipment for these efforts: long ladders, leather buckets, axes, and [...] "firehooks" [...] for pulling down buildings (see illustration right, see also pike pole). Sometimes taller buildings were levelled to the ground quickly and effectively by means of controlled gunpowder explosions. This drastic method of creating firebreaks was increasingly used {{towards the end of}} the Great Fire, and modern historians believe that it was <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> won the struggle.|$|E
500|$|<b>What</b> <b>finally</b> wore down Peddle's {{patience}} {{were two}} letters dated April 7.

[...] The second, from Bosbyshell, imposed the additional requirement that Isabella not wear a crown, which he deemed inappropriate on an American coin.

500|$|With the {{construction}} of the Sørland Line to Kongsberg, which opened on 10 November 1871, proposals were launched to extend the line up Numedal. On 16 August 1873, a meeting was held between representatives from the municipalities in Numedal to discuss how they could convince national politicians to build the Bergen Line through Numedal. However, instead the Bergen Line was decided to run through Hallingdal. <b>What</b> <b>finally</b> spurred {{the construction}} was {{the construction of}} hydroelectric power stations in the valley. In 1907, the government, through its power agency, had secured rights to build a power station in the rivers Numedalslågen and Tunnhovdfjorden. The state saw it as advantageous to build a railway through the valley to aid construction of Nore I and Nore II Power Station, despite the line not being on the railway plan. This was because machines weighing up to [...] would have to be transported up the valley. The initial estimates for the line was a cost of 8.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E

The scandal {{revolving}} around Sharon and [...] "Sully" [...] breaks on the television show GC Buzz, with Case stating: [...] "Sharon always knew the truth would come out. She {{was just trying to}} adjust her mind and heart to the inevitability, even though she was only making things worse." [...] Despite her crime, Case also described Sharon as a victim, and contended that this was not the worst thing Sharon has done. After losing Christian to Nick, Sharon decides to fight for a place in his life. CBS Soaps In Depth wrote that her frustration over no one willing to understand her [...] "is <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> lights a tiny flame of defiance deep inside Sharon". According to Case, [...] "Sharon is willing to do anything for her child. She's fighting for what she believes is right." ...|$|E

2500|$|European {{post offices}} had been {{offering}} parcel post service for decades but in America during those years, as Max Johl observes, [...] "the express company interests had successfully fought such legislative action." [...] <b>What</b> <b>finally</b> defeated this opposition was the well-funded lobbying efforts of Sears Roebuck, other prominent mail-order companies and large department stores. The new government operated parcel delivery service {{was perceived as}} a threat to the business of private delivery companies, such as the Wells-Fargo Express, who consequently lobbied heavily against the Post Office while it was still in the process of establishing itself in the lucrative parcel delivery business, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>finally</b> {{became of}} the Mayflower is an {{unsettled}} issue. Charles Edward Banks, an English {{historian of the}} Pilgrim ship, claims that the ship was finally broken up, with her timbers used {{in the construction of}} a barn at Jordans village in Buckinghamshire. [...] Tradition claims that this barn still exists as the Mayflower Barn, located within the grounds of Old Jordan in South Buckinghamshire. In 1624, Thomas Russell supposedly added to part of a farmhouse already there with timbers from a ship, believed to be from the Pilgrim ship Mayflower, bought from a shipbreaker's yard in Rotherhithe. The well-preserved structure was a tourist attraction, receiving visitors each year {{from all over the world}} and particularly from America, but it is now privately owned and not open to the public.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, Jim Brown secured {{nearly all}} of the votes {{obtained}} by Jeffers, and most of Bruce's supporters are believed to have switched to Thompson. Brown won the general election with 665,608 votes (51.1 percent) to Thompson's 617,907 (48.9 percent). The percent for Brown and Jeffers from the primary was a combined 52.2 percent, or 1.1 percentage points more than <b>what</b> Brown <b>finally</b> received in the final phase of the race. Thompson and Bruce {{in the first round of}} balloting had a combined 47.7 percent, or 1.2 percentage points below <b>what</b> Thompson <b>finally</b> received. For years, Thompson said that she never expected to lose the race. In 1983, she attempted to unseat East Baton Rouge Parish Clerk of Court Mike Cannon. Though she ran well enough to make the general election, she again was defeated.|$|R

2500|$|While the decaketide {{is still}} {{associated}} with the KS/CLF heterodimer the 9-carbonyl group is reduced by Dps E, the 9-ketoreductase, using NADPH as the reducing agent/hydride donor. [...] Dps F, the “1st ring cyclase” /aromatase, is very specific {{and is in the}} family of C-7/C-12 cyclases that require prior C-9 keto-reduction. [...] These two reactions are felt to occur while the polyketide chain is still partially in the KS/CLF tunnel and it is not known <b>what</b> <b>finally</b> cleaves the chain from its covalent link to the KS or ACP. If the Dps F cyclase is inactivated by mutations or gene deletions, the chain will cyclize spontaneously in random fashion. Thus, Dps F is thought to “chaperone” or help fold the polyketide to ensure non-random cyclization, a reaction that is energetically favorable and leads to subsequent dehydration and resultant aromatization.|$|E
