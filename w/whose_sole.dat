5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player <b>whose</b> <b>sole</b> responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E

For on his bed was Mrs. Zapp, her rotund curves {{stretching}} behind her large flat feet, <b>whose</b> <b>soles</b> were toward him. She was noisily somnolent; her stays creaked regularly as she breathed, except when she moved slightly and groaned.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the workmen}} are shrewd Politicians <b>whose</b> <b>sole</b> {{object is to}} furnish the public with words instead of things; others, {{ordinary}} scribblers of abstractions, or even ignoramuses, and unable to distinguish words from things, imagine that they are framing laws by stringing together a lot of phrases.|$|E
50|$|The paw also {{includes}} a horn-like, beak shaped claw on each digit. Though usually hairless, certain animals do have fur on the soles of their paws. An example is the red panda, <b>whose</b> furry <b>soles</b> help insulate them in their snowy habitat.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{economic}} climate, demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s, which led to structural changes at Hydro-Québec.

50|$|The {{eyes are}} black in daylight, but glow bright emerald green when {{caught in a}} {{spotlight}} at night. The dorsal fur is brown in summer, while the underparts are whitish and tinged with yellowish or buffy brown from the chin to the inguinal region. The tail has a distinct black tip. Long-tailed weasels in Florida and the southwestern US may have facial markings of a white or yellowish colour. In northern areas in winter, the long-tailed weasel's fur becomes white, sometimes with yellow tints, but the tail retains its black tip. The long-tailed weasel moults twice annually, once in autumn (October to mid-November) and once in spring (March-April). Each moult takes about 3-4 weeks and is governed by day length and mediated by the pituitary gland. Unlike the stoat, <b>whose</b> <b>soles</b> are thickly furred all year, the long-tailed weasel's soles are naked in summer. The long-tailed weasel has well-developed anal scent glands, which produce a strong and musky odour. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces in order to leave the scent, to mark their territory and, when startled or threatened, to discourage predators.|$|R

In infants, jaundice can be measured using invasive or non-invasive methods.|$|R

25|$|The {{organization}} was initially run with WFP; in 1988 UNDP {{took over the}} administration of UNBRO from WFP. In 1991 the UN Secretary General decided that UNHCR would replace UNDP as the administrative agency.

UNBRO was phased out in December 2001.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{majority}} of the school buildings are above their standards, the Government is not responsible for the school's maintenance. Replacements of plant and machinery as well as the upkeeping of existing facilities require substantial sums of money.

In early 1992, the La Salle Foundation was established with Michael Sze as the first chairman.|$|E
25|$|The law is {{currently}} unsettled {{with regard to}} websites that contain links to infringing material; however, {{there have been a}} few lower-court decisions which have ruled against linking in some narrowly prescribed circumstances. One is when the owner of a website has already been issued an injunction against posting infringing material on their website and then links to the same material in an attempt to circumvent the injunction. Another area involves linking to software or devices which are designed to circumvent (digital rights management) devices, or links from websites <b>whose</b> <b>sole</b> purpose is to circumvent copyright protection by linking to copyrighted material.|$|E

In 1993, and later distribution of another NBC series California Dreams in 1994, Rysher merged with Al Masini's Television Program Enterprises to form Rysher TPE, its alternate name used from 1993 to 1995. Through Rysher TPE, they produced and distributed shows such as Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (renamed Lifestyles with Robin Leach and Shari Belafonte for its final season) and Star Search.

25|$|Resistive {{ballasts}} {{were the}} only type that was usable when the only supply available to power the fluorescent lamp was DC. Such fittings used the thermal type of starter (mostly because they had gone out use long before the glow starter was invented), but {{it was possible to}} include a choke in the circuit <b>whose</b> <b>sole</b> purpose was to provide a pulse on opening of the starter switch to improve starting. DC fittings were complicated by the need to reverse the polarity of the supply to the tube each time it started. Failure to do so vastly shortened the life of the tube.|$|E
25|$|Combinatory logic can {{be viewed}} as a variant of the lambda calculus, in which lambda {{expressions}} (representing functional abstraction) are replaced by a limited set of combinators, primitive functions from which bound variables are absent. It is easy to transform lambda expressions into combinator expressions, and combinator reduction is much simpler than lambda reduction. Hence combinatory logic has been used to model some non-strict functional programming languages and hardware. The purest form of this view is the programming language Unlambda, <b>whose</b> <b>sole</b> primitives are the S and K combinators augmented with character input/output. Although not a practical programming language, Unlambda is of some theoretical interest.|$|E
5000|$|Upon the film's 1981 re-release {{under the}} title Holy Terror, Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave the film a {{positive}} review, writing: [...] "Mr. <b>Sole,</b> <b>whose</b> first feature this is, knows how to direct actors, how to manipulate suspense and when to shift gears: {{the identity of the}} killer is revealed at just that point when the audience is about to make the identification, after which the film becomes less of a horror film than an exercise in suspense. He also has a good feeling for the lower middle-class locale and the realities of {{the lives of the people}} who live in it." [...] A review published by TV Guide gave the film four out of five stars, calling it [...] "an excellent low-budget horror film from director <b>Sole,</b> <b>whose</b> impressive grasp of filmmaking technique and eye for the grotesque keeps the viewer on edge throughout the movie." [...] Time Out, London also gave the film a positive review, noting: [...] "The plot investigates the murder; the film examines the family's self-destruction; and the film-makers construct a running commentary on the themes of Alfred Hitchcock: against a carefully evoked background of Catholicism emerge twin themes of repression and guilt." ...|$|R
