50|$|Encompassing video, {{sculpture}} and architectural elements, 'Form Variations' (2014) {{is a single}} channel video installation housed inside a viewing apparatus. Consisting of a wall structure, curtain, seating, <b>window</b> <b>box</b> and sculptural objects these items are lifted into the space from their roles in the video. The seating dimensions are based upon the two most common current widescreen cinematic display formats and the <b>window</b> <b>box</b> (which allows the audience to glimpse a reframed version of the video from outside the viewing room) also uses this logic, employing the 1.375:1 Academy ratio that was standardised in 1932. The video is shot in CinemaScope and uses this hyper-wide frame to maximise a precise cinematographic view on three-dimensional form. Key to the video is a re-imagining of the opening shot from Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Eclisse (1962) in which the character of Riccardo's arm transitions between animate and inanimate form.|$|E
