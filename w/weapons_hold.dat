50|$|There are a {{total of}} 13 weapons in the game, divided into three groups: bullet weapons (using {{infinite}} ammo), missile weapons (using limited ammo that varies), and magic weapons. The missile weapons constitute {{the bulk of the}} entire available arsenal in the game, and are usually powerful enough to attack groups of several enemies. Magic weapons, like missile <b>weapons,</b> <b>hold</b> varying limited ammo, depending on the weapon. Players can carry {{a total of}} four different arms at once: all three bullet weapons (a single pistol, dual pistols, and a submachine gun) and either a missile or a magic weapon.|$|E
50|$|Cody {{gets his}} brother Alex {{to make sure}} his parents do not find out that he is gone by giving him the $5,000 the CIA gave him. Knowing Natalie's {{location}} via a tracking device in a necklace he gave her as a birthday present, Cody breaks into the CIA <b>weapons</b> <b>hold</b> and steals a rocket powered snowboard and other devices to rescue Natalie. Cody gets a ride {{to the top of the}} mountain and snowboards to the factory where Natalie is held. On the way, he gets caught in a grove of trees as Ronica finds him using a SoloTrek XFV. After convincing her that they need to rescue Natalie, the pair infiltrate the laboratory and Cody rescues Natalie, also explaining the truth about why he went out with her.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{no known}} {{national}} {{leader of the}} Bloods but individual Bloods sets have a hierarchical leadership structure with identifiable levels of membership. These levels of membership indicate status within a gang. A leader, typically an older member with a more extensive criminal background, runs each set. A set leader is not elected but rather asserts himself by developing and managing the gang's criminal enterprises through his reputation for violence and ruthlessness and through his personal charisma. The majority of set members are called [...] "soldiers", who are typically {{between the ages of}} 16 and 22. Soldiers have a strong sense of commitment to their set and are extremely dangerous because of their willingness to use violence both to obtain the respect of gang members and to respond to any person who [...] "disrespects" [...] the set. [...] "Associates" [...] are not full members, but they identify with the gang and take part in various criminal activities. To the extent that women belong to the gang, they are usually associate members and tend to be used by their male counterparts to carry <b>weapons,</b> <b>hold</b> drugs, or prostitute themselves to make money for their set.|$|E

50|$|The game plays {{similarly}} {{to the main}} Mega Man games - the player uses one button to jump, and one to fire the character's arm-mounted energy <b>weapon.</b> <b>Holding</b> the fire button charges the weapon in order to release a stronger blast. Holding down while pressing the jump button makes the character perform a dash, the appearance of which varies between characters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legality}} of open carry of certain firearms in Virginia was reaffirmed after several 2004 incidents in which citizens openly carrying firearms were confronted by local law enforcement.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis research compares the fixed wing altitude algorithms utilized in the United States and the Australian {{versions of the}} combat modeling tool, JANUS(A). The Australian Army Battle Simulatian Group has recently developed a new algorithm that more realistically models aircraft flight profiles within JANUS(A). A Low-High-Low strike profile was simulated, using both algorithms, against low level, littoral anti-aircraft weaponry The simulated aircraft were flown in a <b>weapons</b> <b>hold</b> environment and number of detections were recorded over the entire strike route as the principal MOE. The simulated aircraft were then subjected to a weapons free environment where engagement data was compiled. The Australian algorithm enabled the operator to alter aircraft altitude and speed during the simulation on command. The ability to alter altitude and speed are essential to accurately modelling tactical evasive manuevers. These alterations are not features incorporated in the present U. S. version of JANUS(A). Analysis indicates this controllability not only {{reduced the number of}} detections significantly, but also increased aircraft survivabihty within the strike environment. Both of these phenomenon are expected outcomes of such evasive actions This work also provided the basis for future work that could incorporate virtual simulation with JANUS(A). U. S.

[...] Furthermore, the game is controlled by changing direction, jumping, firing your weapon and changing your <b>weapon.</b> <b>Holding</b> down the fire button continues to fire in the direction you were facing when you started shooting.|$|R

These tenets, known as the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, were first stated by Prime Minister Eisaku Satō in 1967, and were adopted as a parliamentary resolution in 1971, though they have never formally been entered into law. They continue to reflect the attitudes of both government and the general public, who remain staunchly opposed to the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons.|$|R

60|$|The {{charge of}} the 21st Lancers had been costly, {{but it was not}} ineffective. The {{consequent}} retirement of the Dervish brigade protecting the extreme right exposed their line of retreat. The cavalry were resolved {{to take full advantage of}} the position they had paid so much to gain, and while the second attack was at its height we were already trotting over the plain towards the long lines of fugitives who streamed across it. With the experience of the past hour in our minds, and with the great numbers of the enemy in our front, it seemed to many that a bloody day lay before us.

50|$|There was a hurried {{examination}} of even more marginal storage sites, {{but the situation}} was overtaken by actual events. By early 1942 German raids were markedly less threatening than anticipated, thus {{the need for the}} additional protection of underground storage was no longer paramount, indeed the sites came to be regarded as expensive white elephants. The method of supply of ammunition was soon changed, with supplies moving directly from the factories to the Forward Ammunition Depots, cutting the underground stores out of the system and relegating them to stores for obsolete stock and chemical <b>weapons,</b> <b>holding</b> points for very large cargoes, and repair centres. Three large new surface sites were also established at Gisburn and Wortley in Yorkshire, and Longparish/Harewood Forest in Hampshire. Longparish was designed to hold 40,000 tons of ammunition and the other sites 25,000 tons each.|$|R
