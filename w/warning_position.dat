40|$|Approved for Public release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA technique {{has been developed}} to determine objectively {{the location of a}} tropical cyclone at warning time and reduce the short-term forecast errors due to errors in the <b>warning</b> <b>position.</b> The western North Pacific CLIPER (CLImatology and PERsistence) forecast scheme is used to generate a potential track, from each fix, and a smooth curve is fit to the future and past positions. When multiple fixes are available, weighting functions are applied to account for fix platform accuracy and time of receipt. A set of 836 cases from 30 storms during 1981 - 1983 was evaluated. Using the objective scheme, 16 of the 30 tropical cyclones had reduced <b>warning</b> <b>position</b> errors compared to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center official <b>warning</b> <b>position.</b> For 11 of the 30 storms, the objective warning positions resulted in more accurate 24 -h forecasts with the CLIPER technique than the official warning positions.

40|$|The {{function}} of the variously shaped ultimate legs of Scolopendridae is briefly reviewed. Their function in Scolopendra heros Girard, 1853, Scolopendra subspinipes Leach, 1815, Scolopendra morsitans (Linnaeus, 1758), Scolopendra galapagoensis Bollman, 1889, Scolopendra hainanum Kronmüller, 2012, Scolopendra spinosissima Kraepelin, 1903 Cormocephalus aurantiipes (Newport, 1844) and Ethmostigmus trigonopodus (Leach, 1817), {{in which they are}} least specialised has been investigated. Specimens were tapped with forceps on different parts of the trunk to simulate the attack of a predator. When tapped on the first third of the trunk (near the head), the centipedes attacked the forceps with their forcipules. When tapped on the last third or the ultimate legs, they adopted a <b>warning</b> <b>position,</b> raising the ultimate legs to display the ventral and medial prefemoral spines as well as the spined coxopleural processes. In some cases the centipedes attacked the forceps with the claws of the ultimate legs by chopping down on them after lifting the legs high into the <b>warning</b> <b>position.</b> When tapped in the mid part of the trunk, the centipedes curled sideways to reach the forceps with their forcipules and ultimate legs simultaneously. Scolopendra galapagoensis not only lifted the ultimate legs into the <b>warning</b> <b>position</b> but also the last 3 - 4 pairs of locomotory legs, presenting their distodorsal prefemoral spines. This resembles the warning posture of some spiders. In addition to their function in warning behaviour, defensive stabbing, ritualised meeting reactions and during courtship behaviour, the ultimate legs may in addition act as hooks and perhaps be involved in species recognition. No evidence was found that the ultimate legs are used to catch prey, nor of prey or predators being held between the prefemora...|$|E

Manufacturers {{have a legal}} duty to warn about predictable product dangers. and currently the legal system heavily {{emphasizes the importance of}} such written product warnings in determining product liability issues. The legal system's reliance on such warnings rests on the assumption that these warnings are effective in influencing user behavior. An e 1 periment was conducted to provide behavioral data pertaining to the effectiveness of such warnings; by investigating the effects of position. highlighting, and imbedding warnings on detection. recall and compliance with warnings through actual user behavior. Three <b>warning</b> <b>positions</b> (top. middle. and bottom) were varied on the label of a consumer product. as were two warning highlighting conditions (inverted and not inverted) and two warning imbeddedness conditions. The imbeddeding consisted of begining the Warning setion with either the critical warning information (the unimbedded condition) or a superfluous warning statement followed by the critical information (the imbedded condition). An additional "control" group condition vas used in which the critical safety information vas included in the Directions section on the label. with no formal Warning section appearing at all. In the experiment each of 1 subjects was given a product and a situation in which they had to actually use it. Through direct user observation the influence of the warning on user behavior was directly measured and follow-up questions provided insights into the underlying factors involved. The follow-up questions were specifically focused to determine if the user 1) noticed the warning. 2) then read it. and 3) followed it. The purpose being to find out where along this three step process people dropped out (if at all) and more importantly, if they did drop out, why. The results showed a consistent decline over all experimental conditions {{in terms of the number}} of people who first noticed, read and then complied with the warning. Surprisingly, the only variable to have a differential effect on warning compliance was that of imbedding. Imbedding the critical warning information significantly reduced warning compliance, as subjects stopped reading the warning prior to reaching the critical safety information. A further unanticipated finding was that placing the critical safety information within a separate Warning section. as opposed to placing it within the Directions. dramatically reduced the number of subjects who read and fully recalled the warning yet failed to comply with the warning because of forgetting. This suggests that the utility of a Warning section may be that if the material is read, it becomes more salient and less forgettable to the user.

The purpose of this report is to make a survey of the available open project related information and summarize it. The considered projects were located in Europe, USA and Japan. Finally a total of 79 projects were considered significant. The approach for getting an overview of these projects was to combine project descriptions (i. e. project explicit views) with project classification metrics (i. e. project implicit views). It is believed that this approach results in a representative state-of-the-art overview of wireless communication vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure projects. In this report links are also given to a number of related organisations (about a hundred). Apart from the projects as such it is possible to see differences in Europe, USA and Japan using the surveyed projects. There is a strong governmental support in USA and Japan. In Europe governmental support is indirect via the European Commission and the picture is more heterogeneous with many different countries involved. As it seems this is reflected in * The higher number of projects in Europe compared to USA and Japan. * More overlapping projects in Europe compared to USA and Japan.

40|$|For many roadway applications, high-accuracy in-lane level vehicle {{position}} information is desired. Unfortunately, in many roadway environments GPS dead zones hinder sufficient GPS position accuracy. These roadway environments include underpasses, tree canopies, urban canyons, {{and any other}} locations where the view to the sky is limited. This report introduces a high-accuracy position estimator that augments GPS in areas where short-term (< 200 meter and < 15 second) GPS dead zones exist. The position estimator fuses differential GPS (DGPS) position measurements, yaw rate measurements, and two-dimensional velocity measurements to provide in-lane level accuracy position estimates. The estimator increases the availability of high-accuracy position estimates for applications that demand continuous high-accuracy in-lane level positioning, such as lane departure <b>warning</b> systems. The <b>position</b> estimator was evaluated and the position accuracy was quantified. Seven vehicles were outfitted with the position estimator system. Data was collected for 460 DGPS outages and {{the accuracy of the}} system was analyzed.

This analysis provides a level of confidence in the position estimates as a function of distance and time elapsed from the start of a DGPS outage. This level of confidence measure allows applications to have a means to reject position estimates based on the outage time and distance if those estimates are projected to have lower accuracy than the application requires...|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} {{assignments}} managed by an IAM system may significantly increase over years [2]. For instance, during our evaluation (cf. Section 5.4), we analyzed an SAP ERP system {{with more than}} one million assignments of single roles to SAP user accounts, resulting in more than 36 million objects for authorization (transactions, activities, etc.). Even when such systems are carefully managed, it is hardly possible to have a detailed knowledge about every user and all of his possibilities to interact with the system based on assigned permissions. This is only one example of the growing size and complexity of modern IAM systems. While the raw data itself already is hard to comprehend due to its volume, the relations within such data are even harder to perceive. However, we argue that integrating data from the various context types explained in Section 3.2. 1 can lead to a better understanding concerning the occurrence of security incidents. Due to the load of IAM data, such connections between data types need to be established in an automated way. Through detailed inspection of the integrated data, so called IAM KPIs may be defined acting as thresholds for normal behavior. Consider an example where the chief financial officer of a company is analyzing his company’s net value statistics. While it is perfectly normal for him to regularly check this information, such re-occurring usage patterns integrated with the time and location of access can be good indicators for regular behavior. If such a predefined KPI reaches a value tuple that is outside of its previously common boundaries, either at runtime or ex-post, measures can be taken in order to justify abnormal behavior. Another simple KPI example are significant behavioral or entitlement changes of an employee, where there might be several reasons. Including events of the employee’s history into the KPI may result in better observations about possible reasons for the changes (e.g. switched department or <b>position,</b> <b>warnings)</b> in order to generate high-quality security notifications. Thus, automatically generated information out of static data may provide an enhanced view on company events and therefore enable better automated decisions.|$|R
