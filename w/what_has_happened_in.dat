5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the rest}} of Querétaro's notable sites are located in the {{historic}} center, which is pedestrian-friendly and filled with colonial architecture. The local government maintains this area well, with cleaning crews to keep the streets clean and regulating vendors so that they do not block streets and sidewalks. In the evening, the area fills with people strolling the plazas and walkways and frequenting the area's restaurants, cafes and food stands. One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> these places. This event begins at the main plaza, the Plaza de Armas {{in the center of the}} city with a reenactment of the legend of Carambada. Then the show wanders the street all the while telling tales related to bandits, loves and myths. These tales demand audience participation providing lines and provoking debate.|$|E

25|$|This mandapam is {{used for}} the {{distribution}} of free food everyday to all those who visit the temple. It is located 2 mins walk from the Southern premises of the temple property. This mandapam serves to validate the values that are mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic of Manimekalai. The epic is set in both the harbour town of Kaveripattinam, the modern town of Puhar in Tamil Nadu, and in Nainativu, a small sandy island of the Jaffna Peninsula. The story follows the following plot: The dancer-courtesan Manimekalai is pursued by the amorous Cholan prince Udyakumaran, but rather wants to dedicate herself to a religious celibate life. The sea goddess Manimekala Theivam (Manimekalai Devi) puts her to sleep and takes her to the island Manipallavam (Nainathivu). After waking up and wandering about the island Manimekalai comes across the Dharma-seat, which was placed there by Lord Indra, on which Buddha had taught and appeased two warring Naga princes. Those who worship it miraculously know their previous life. Manimekalai automatically worshiped it and recollects <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> her previous life. She then meets the guardian goddess of the Dharma seat, Deeva-Teelakai (Dvipa Tilaka) who explains her the significance of the Dharma seat and lets her acquire the magic never-failing begging bowl (cornucopia) called Amurta Surabhi (”cow of abundance”), which will always provide food to alleviate hunger. As such, devotees and visitors are welcomed to enjoy a traditional meal after visiting the temple.|$|E

In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [...] after <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me." ...|$|E
500|$|In October, {{two former}} first ministers voiced their {{concern about the}} {{direction}} of the party. Jack McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described Labour as [...] "a political machine that is angry about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Scotland in the recent past". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded [...] "enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily" [...] because its supporters no longer understood [...] "what the party stands for". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its [...] "socialist principles". Lamont's deputy, Anas Sarwar, later suggested that during the referendum campaign, Labour [...] "had stopped being a movement for change and fell into a trap of being defenders of the past and defenders of the establishment". The New Statesman claimed that Labour had spent [...] "decades treating Scotland {{as little more than a}} one-party state" [...] and needed to [...] " [...] itself [...] relevant again for the people whom it was established to represent". Stephen Daisley, political editor of STV News, suggested that Labour had [...] "responded to the Nationalist advance by electing a succession of decent but ineffectual Holyrood leaders who were dominated by the Westminster party machine".|$|E

500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|E
500|$|Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the {{referendum}} returned [...] "Yes" [...] votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after {{the referendum}}, a Daily Mail article claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being {{lined up to}} take over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, {{the first of the}} post-referendum era. [...] "When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland." [...] Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as [...] "a political machine that is angry about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> Scotland in the recent past".
