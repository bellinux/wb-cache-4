5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2000, Corzine denied {{having made}} {{payments}} to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, {{director of the}} Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reciprocal endorsement.|$|E
5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam {{that creates}} a passage through the ice towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.|$|E

50|$|Thunderblast is not {{the first}} Transformer to possess an {{especially}} feminine figure, with features such as a shaped torso, hips and even <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> breasts underneath her chest-plate, (Blackarachnia was perhaps most notable for this) but she <b>is</b> the first <b>to</b> have <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nipples, seen only for perhaps one instant in the show itself.|$|R
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear {{of someone who has}} been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their fear.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> metal vertebra. After he leaves the room, the metal vertebra begins to spin, growing into what looks like {{the beginnings of a}} metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male {{in an act of}} apparent aggression.|$|E

5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining his night. Lee and Ben {{make their way to}} the beach and share a kiss. Tim returns to the {{backyard}} and uncovers a ring and <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> human hand before he decides to stop digging. He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E

5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} commences with Inna wearing a pink leotard, {{following}} {{which she and}} other women practice pole dancing. Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde blouse {{in front of a}} neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon signs are shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track. Cut scenes show the singer dancing and performing a slut drop in front of a wet glass surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{two men are}} {{haunted by}} the fate the girl will suffer and {{formulate}} a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> domed city built in a crater. Police hovercrafts are in pursuit, {{and one of them}} comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses {{to let go of the}} hands of her rescuers, and the three of them fall into the abyss.|$|E

5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> giant tear {{in the side of}} the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Gonsales is a Spaniard {{forced to}} flee the country after killing {{a man in a}} duel. Having made his fortune in the East Indies, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of St Helena to recover. There he discovers a species of wild swan able to carry {{substantial}} loads, the gansa, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of Tenerife. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local mandarin. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of Jesuit missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.|$|E
