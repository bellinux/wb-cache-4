50|$|Hardcore wrestling is {{a subset}} of {{professional}} wrestling where some, any, {{or all of the}} traditional rules do not apply. Most often this simply means there are no disqualifications, which itself eliminates countouts, allowing decisions to take place anywhere. Other common euphemisms for hardcore matches are Street Fight (which suggests wrestlers are to dress in normal street clothes), Extreme Rules match, Ultraviolent Rules match (hardcore rules matches exclusively in CZW that usual involve ladders, tables, steel folding chairs, thumbtacks, barbed wire, <b>weed</b> <b>whackers,</b> light tubes, and fire), HardKore X-Treme match (A version of the Hardcore match except weapons include flaming tables, flaming chairs, razor wire, sheets of glass and weapons wrapped in barbed wire), No Holds Barred match, Bimbo Brawl (involving female wrestlers in a hardcore match), and the Good Housekeeping match (which emphasized the use of kitchen implements as weapons).|$|R

50|$|Grepper, {{a product}} {{developer}} and entrepreneur designed the Coolest, initially using a <b>weed</b> <b>whacker</b> {{to build a}} portable gas-powered blender.

Grepper has said that improvements in technology and the reduced size of components made him realize that the multi-function cooler could be engineered as a consumer product and developed a prototype using 3D printing technology.|$|E
5000|$|Upon the game's {{release for}} the Wii Virtual Console, Zombies Ate My Neighbors {{received}} immense praise and earned an Editor's Choice Award from IGN. The game has {{been regarded as}} one of [...] "the most requested additions to the VC system even before the Wii launch". Comparisons to the game Dead Rising, released for the Xbox 360 in 2006, have been drawn, Lucas Thomas of IGN saying [...] "Zombies Ate My Neighbors is basically a comical 16-bit template for the new Xbox 360 release, Dead Rising. And like that game, this one arms you with a pretty bizarre arsenal. <b>Weed</b> <b>whackers,</b> exploding soda cans and flying silverware all make an appearance to help you, or you and a friend, put a hurt on these living dead." [...] GameFAQs described the Xbox 360 game Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia as [...] "a tribute to the classic Zombies Ate My Neighbors" [...] due to its similar game play, scenario, and B-Movie humor.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Boss of Me" [...] {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Ted Crittenden. It is based on Malcolm in the Middle, and contains the characters and set from the show. It begins with Dewey going through a dumpster that says [...] "TMBG Toys". He {{climbs out of the}} dumpster and rides his bike home while dragging the box full of toys. The box goes into Dewey's backyard where Malcolm is raking leaves, their father, Hal, is cooking on a barbecue, and Reese is using hedge clippers on a tree. Dewey opens the box, revealing toy versions of TMBG. But whenever there's a close-up in the box, it is the real band in miniature. A Hawaiian hula dancer toy joins TMBG as Dewey sways back and forth with her. Malcolm and Reese begin shooting the toys with paintball guns until one of them accidentally shoots Hal. Though not shown, it's presumed to have been Reese who shot him as he is later seen using a <b>weed</b> <b>whacker.</b> The John Flansburgh toy is lying in the grass with his arm detached. Reese spots him and, while using the <b>weed</b> <b>whacker,</b> launches him onto the grill where Hal accidentally eats him, much to Dewey's shock. Later, the John Linnell toy is placed in a model airplane that is launched across the street before curving back and landing on the driveway. As Hal drives up, he picks up the airplane to examine it. The plane explodes because it still had a lit fuse. Hal then angrily gathers the TMBG toys into the box and drives back to the dumpster where he promptly tosses it back in.|$|E

5000|$|A {{hardcore}} match, {{sometimes referred}} to as a Raven's Rules match, tends to be somewhere in between, and that emphasize the blood, brutality, and real violence, instead emphasis on the brutality of the attacks, moderate brawling techniques, the use of foreign objects and other obstacles of various sorts such as chairs, chains, tables, kendo sticks, fireballs, ladders, and tire irons, and the extreme physical toll on the wrestlers involved, but also often combined with brawling all over the arena or anywhere rather than traditional wrestling holds and techniques.

40|$|A report {{describes}} flexible mechanical conveying {{systems for}} transporting fine cohesive regolith under microgravity and vacuum conditions. They are totally enclosed, virtually dust-free, and can include enough {{flexibility in the}} conveying path to enable an expanded range of extraction and transport scenarios, including nonlinear drill-holes and excavation of enlarged subsurface openings without large entry holes. The design of the conveyors is a modification of conventional screw conveyors such that the central screw-shaft and the outer housing or conveyingtube have a degree of bending flexibility, allowing the conveyors to become nonlinear conveying systems that can convey around gentle bends. The central flexible shaft is {{similar to those used}} in common tools like a <b>weed</b> <b>whacker,</b> consisting of multiple layers of tightly wound wires around a central wire core. Utilization of compliant components (screw blade or outer wall) increases the robustness of the conveying, allowing an occasional oversized particle to pass hough the conveyor without causing a jam or stoppag...|$|E
