Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was in the frame to return to action around Christmas time – three months ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|Kim {{successfully}} defended her title against Taryn Terrell on the September 3 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling. After the match, Kim and Terrell were both {{attacked by the}} debuting Havok. Kim and Havok brawled on the following edition of Impact Wrestling. In September, Kim injured her shoulder during a pre-match brawl with Havok. Going against doctors advice, Kim defended her title later that night and lost her championship to Havok. Soon after, {{it was announced that}} Kim had suffered a separated shoulder and torn ligaments at the hands of Havok, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action indefinitely. Kim returned to Impact Wrestling in November, however her shoulder was not fully healed. Despite this, she demanded her rematch for the Knockouts title against Havok, which Kim would ultimately lose.|$|E

5|$|An 86th-minute {{equaliser}} from McBreen gave York a 1–1 draw {{at home to}} Salisbury City, which {{maintained the}} team's unbeaten record at Bootham Crescent. Parslow signed a new contract with the club, and Rotherham midfielder Peter Holmes joined on a one-month loan. A second defeat of the season came after losing 2–0 away to Kidderminster, Brian Smikle and Justin Richards scoring for the home team. Beadle was released by the club {{towards the end of}} his loan spell at Whitby, due to him looking for regular first-team football. This was followed by the departure of Bore, who returned to Grimsby from his loan spell early. A 3–3 draw away against Stevenage was achieved after the team were 2–0 down after 19 minutes, with the York goals coming from Sodje, Holmes and Farrell. Sodje picked up a hamstring injury during this match, meaning he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for four to six weeks.|$|E
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the entire day), for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German technical failure in air-to-air communication.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements {{and the rise of}} Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E

5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually rise above the crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.|$|E

Post-match, she and Fox were attacked by the special guest referee for the match Cameron, which would lead to a triple–threat match the following week, with Cameron coming out victorious.

50|$|Bowman's Best sets have {{a unique}} issue called an Atomic Refractor that is much more rare than the regular Refractor parallel.

If the regular Refractor <b>is</b> numbered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 100, the Atomic one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> numbered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 25. In addition to the lower serial numbers, Atomic Refractors feature a different background design than regular Refractors.|$|R
5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{suffered}} an injury setback in October 2007 after breaking his elbow in a 1–0 home win over Roma in the Champions League group stage. As {{a result of}} the injury he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for up to six weeks. His return to action came on 3 November as a substitute for Anderson in a 2–2 draw at Arsenal. Carrick scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 2008 in the Manchester derby, his goal came in injury time and was mere consolation in a 2–1 home loss to rivals Manchester City. His second and final goal of the season came against his former club West Ham United in a 4–1 win at home on 3 May. Although he scored just two league goals that season it still led to another league title as United beat Wigan Athletic {{on the final day of}} the season to prevent Chelsea from reaching the top spot. On 18 April, one week on from their title success Carrick was offered a new five-year contract along with defenders Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown. A four-year contract was then signed on 17 May 2008, which tied Carrick to United until at least June 2012. He participated in his first-ever Champions League final on 21 May in Moscow, playing the full 120 minutes in a 6–5 penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the 2008 final. The scoreline ended 1–1 after extra time, he took United's second penalty of the subsequent shootout, which he converted to help give him the first European honour of his career.|$|E
5|$|Doubtful {{of their}} ability to capture the redoubt alone, at 13:15 Meldrum asked for reinforcements; he was {{informed}} there were no more available. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles, advanced into a gap between the Wellingtons and the 5th Mounted Brigade, which eased the pressure. By 15:00 the superior Turkish numbers and their strong defences, forced Meldrum to commit his reserve, the 2nd Squadron and a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron. At the same time, the horses were moved further to the rear so that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> artillery range. At 15:15 the regiment's right was counter-attacked by three or four hundred Turkish troops. Fifteen minutes later Meldrum again asked for reinforcements; he was again refused. Supported by their artillery, the regiment held out until 17:00, when the Turks retired, having suffered heavy losses. An hour later the regiment was ordered to withdraw at nightfall. The 2nd Squadron reported that they had gained a position which allowed them to assault the redoubt. Meldrum, aware that the redoubt would have to be abandoned even if they were successful, refused to allow the assault. At 18:30 the Royal Horse Artillery withdrew. Then, confusingly, the regiment was ordered to remain where they were, until the yeomanry to their left had moved back. So it was not until 20:15 that the regiment left the front line. At 01:00 20 April the regiment reached the night camp at El Jemme. Their casualties during the battle amounted to one dead and twenty-three wounded. The same night, this second attempt to capture Gaza was called off.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without legal standing in US affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. Holding to the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 miles at sea.|$|E
