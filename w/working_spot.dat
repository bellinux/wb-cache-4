The use of {{ultrasonic}} {{nondestructive testing}} of material internal defect, ultrasonic signal acquired at actual <b>working</b> <b>spot</b> usually includes {{large amount of}} noise. Extraction of the defect characteristic information will be influeced greatly if the ultrasonic signal is not effectively denoised. A new method based on best wavelet packet base is present to denoise and detect the ultrasonic signal. The superiority of new method is verified by simulation examples. Experiment of processing ultrasonic signal which comes from the 45 Steel specimen with flaws has been implemented. The accurate information that characterizes of defect size,location can be extracted from the processing result, {{the results show that}} the new method based on best wavelet packet base is in favor of enhancing the degree of accuracy for quantitatively analyzing the defect inside the material...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this article, a new {{combustion}} control {{program would be}} introduced, which is planned to use fuzzy neural network for intelligent analysis of temperature variation on end fire glass furnace. This program would be adapted to regenerative end fire glass furnace. The actual running of system indicates {{that the system is}} in good effect and suitable for the production technology very well. Preface The melting of glass is a complex physical-chemistry reaction, which is full of not only delays and inertia, but also is nonlinear. Affected by different factors, such as gas pressure, batch uniformity and insulating of furnace etc, this reaction becomes a complex thermal process. Thus, it is difficult to set an accurate mathematical model to control this complex process. However, as an important procedure in this reaction, the commutation system for regenerative furnace would not only affect the glass quality and the energy consumption but also concern about the environment protection and labor’s protection. Nowadays, the PID {{combustion control}} system is widely used in glass factory. This PID system could run very well in a small range around the <b>working</b> <b>spot.</b> However, when the melting process is in big undulation, the control effect becomes bad because of the delay and the changed parameters...|$|E
40|$|Going {{through the}} {{historical}} {{accounts of the}} press in India, though the women entered the journalistic profession {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, they did not played an important role in designing and reshaping it. Today there are several women editors, columnists and television anchors. In the last decade, more women have entered the profession, and many have equal access to all beats, blurring the ‘traditional male area’ line considerably. In this context, a study was conducted to know the working conditions and their suitability in the media. The study was conducted in Chennai. A Sample of 60 respondents was selected randomly by using purposive random sampling technique. The sample frame for the study includes both male and female journalists of print and electronic media. The respondents comprised of editors, sub- editors, reporters, programme executives and free lancers in both print and electronic media. The data was obtained using the questionnaire and it was analyzed using percentage analysis method.  The findings reveals that women journalists are encouraged and given freedom to organize their work and do not face major discrimination in their <b>working</b> <b>spot</b> on the basis of gender and they are also given decision – making position in the media and their positions in the media is satisfactory. Regarding, importance given for women issues in the media, both men and women journalist consider women issues as one of the important issue and women issues are portrayed adequately in the media...|$|E

40|$|Working code {{examples}} are useful resources for pragmatic reuse in software development. A working code example provides {{a solution to}} a specific programming problem. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} existing code search engines are not successful in finding working code examples. They fail in ranking high quality code examples {{at the top of the}} result set. To address this shortcoming, a variety of pattern-based solutions are proposed in the literature. However, these solutions cannot be integrated seamlessly in Internet-scale source code engines due to their high time complexity or query language restrictions. In this paper, we propose an approach for <b>spotting</b> <b>working</b> code examples which can be adopted by Internet-scale source code search engines. The time complexity of our approach is as low as the complexity of existing code search engines on the Internet and considerably lower than the pattern-based approaches supporting free-form queries. We study the performance of our approach using a representative corpus of 25, 000 open source Java projects. Our findings support the feasibility of our approach for Internet-scale code search. We also found that our approach outperforms Ohloh Code search engine, previously known as Koders, in <b>spotting</b> <b>working</b> code examples...|$|R

40|$|A simple, accurate, and {{economical}} method {{has been proposed}} to measure formaldehyde in aqueous samples.

It has been concluded that the present method had the capability for measuring formaldehyde in aqueous samples at trace level with high precision and accuracy, particularly when dealing with turbid and small volume samples where the standard method failed...|$|R
