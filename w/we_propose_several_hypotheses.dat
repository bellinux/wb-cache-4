40|$|Background: The {{juvenile}} {{stage of}} loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) {{can last for}} decades. In the North Pacific Ocean, much is known about their seasonal movements in relation to pelagic habitat, yet understanding their multi-year, basin-scale movements has proven more difficult. Here, we categorize the large-scale movements of 231 turtles satellite tracked from 1997 to 2013 and {{explore the influence of}} biological and environmental drivers on basin-scale movement. Results: Results show high residency of juvenile loggerheads within the Central North Pacific and a moderate influence of the Earth's magnetic field, but no real-time environmental driver to explain migratory behavior.

40|$|International audienceConcentrations of Water Soluble Organic Carbon (WSOC) and WSOC {{fraction}} to Organic Carbon (OC) {{were measured}} at two urban sites in valleys of the French Alps {{during a period}} of two and a half years. Concentrations were as high as 10 – 15 µg C/m 3 in winter, but there is a clear seasonal cycle of the WSOC fraction, with minima occurring during winter. This reflects a marked dependency on temperature, with the average WSOC fraction being stable at 54. 8 ± 7. 7 % and 75. 9 ± 6. 3 % for temperatures in the ranges - 10 to + 3 °C and 12 to 24 °C, respectively. Several points are noteworthy in this evolution. First, there are limiting factors that prevent lower mass fractions in the low temperature range and higher mass fractions in the high temperature range. Second, the mass fraction at the lower temperature is rather high, in apparent contradiction with OC being mainly insoluble close to the emission sources. Third, the range of 20 % for the change of the WSOC fraction between these extreme conditions is indeed rather narrow when compared to evaluations of the secondary (and supposedly water soluble) OC fraction proposed in the literature, with most of the published values being in the range 40 to 70 %. A comparison of the evolution of WSOC concentrations with that of dicarboxylic acids (DCA) clearly indicates the influence of two regimes in the formation of WSOC: one at higher temperatures classically linked with the increase of DCA concentrations and associated with oxidation processes, and another at lower temperatures involving a much lower increase of DCA concentrations. <b>We</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> involving processes that could be responsible for the large concentrations of WSOC in the particulate phase at our sites during winter time...|$|R

From the radio-tracking data of 36 individuals throughout the active season, the home range of the male steppe tortoise was estimated to be smaller than that of the female (24 vs. 57 ha), even when the analysis focused on the mating season only. During the mating season, males intensively patrolled a small area, going back and forth within their territory, thereby covering greater distances than females.

40|$|We have {{identified}} a putative homologue of the KU 70 gene (AtKU 70) from Arabidopsis thaliana. In order to study its function in plants we have isolated an A. thaliana line that contains a T-DNA inserted into AtKU 70. Plants homozygous for this insertion appear normal and are fertile. In other organisms the KU 70 gene {{has been shown to}} play a role in the repair of DNA damage induced by ionising radiation (IR) and by radiomimetic chemicals such as methylmethane sulfonate (MMS). We show that AtKU 70 –/– plants are hypersensitive to IR and MMS, and thus the AtKU 70 gene plays a similar role in DNA repair in plants as in other organisms. The KU 70 gene also plays a role in maintaining telomere length. Yeast and mammalian cells deficient for Ku 70 have shortened telomeres.

40|$|Abstract: Large banking {{organizations}} in the U. S. hold significantly more equity capital than the minimum required by bank regulators. This capital cushion has built up {{during a period of}} unusual profitability for the banking system, leading some observers to argue that the capital merely reflects recent profits. Others contend that the banks deliberately choose target capital levels based on their risk exposures and their counterparties ’ sensitivities to default risk.

We find evidence to suggest that large BHCs actively managed their capital ratios during our sample period.

40|$|The {{expression}} of ascorbic acid oxidase was studied in zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), {{one of the}} most abundant natural sources of the enzyme. In the developing fruit, specific activity of ascorbic acid oxidase was highest between 4 and 6 days after anthesis. Protein and mRNA levels followed the same trend as enzyme activity. Highest growth rate of the fruit occurred before 6 days after anthesis. Within a given fruit, ascorbic acid oxidase activity and mRNA level were highest in the epidermis, and lowest in the central placental region. In leaf tissue, ascorbic acid oxidase activity was higher in young leaves, and very low in old leaves. Within a given leaf, enzyme activity was highest in the fast-growing region (approximately the lower third of the blade), and lowest in the slow-growing region (near leaf apex). High {{expression of}} ascorbic acid oxidase at a stage when rapid growth is occurring (in both fruits and leaves), and localization of the enzyme in the fruit epidermis, where cells are under greatest tension during rapid growth in girth, suggest that ascorbic acid oxidase might be involved in reorganization of the cell wall to allow for expansion.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} mesendoderm morphogenesis during gastrulation in {{the frog}} Xenopus laevis and investigate {{the mechanics of}} these movements with tissue explants. When a dorsal marginal zone explant is plated onto fibronectin, the mesendoderm {{moves away from the}} dorsal axial tissues as an intact sheet. Mesendodermal cells within these explants display monopolar protrusive activity and radially intercalate during explant extension. Live time-lapse confocal sequences of actin dynamics at the margin of these extending explants prompt us to propose that integrin-mediated traction drives these movements. We demonstrate that integrin α 5 β 1 recognition of the synergy site located within the type III 9 repeat of fibronectin is required for mesendoderm extension. Normal mesendoderm morphogenesis occurs with a unique “cup-shaped” geometry of the extending mesendodermal mantle and coincides with a higher rate of tissue extension than that seen in the simpler dorsal marginal zone explant. These higher rates can be reconstituted with “in-the-round” configurations of <b>several</b> explants. <b>We</b> <b>propose</b> <b>several</b> mechanically based <b>hypotheses</b> to explain both the initial fibronectin-dependent extension of the mesendoderm and additional requirement of tissue geometry during the high-velocity closure of the mesendodermal mantle...|$|R

Their dynamics partly control the foraging {{behavior and the}} displacement of marine top predators (tuna, birds, turtles, and cetaceans). In this work {{we focus on the}} role of submesoscale structures in the Mozambique Channel in the distribution of a marine predator, the Great Frigatebird. Using a newly developed dynamic concept, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent (FSLE), we identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) present in the surface flow in the channel over a 2 -month observation period (August and September 2003). By comparing seabird satellite positions with LCS locations, we demonstrate that frigatebirds track precisely these structures in the Mozambique Channel, providing the first evidence that a top predator is able to track these FSLE ridges to locate food patches. After comparing bird positions during long and short trips and different parts of these trips, <b>we</b> <b>propose</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> to understand how frigatebirds can follow these LCSs.

40|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} {{is considered}} to originate from embolization of a deep-vein thrombosis, resulting in two manifestations of one disease: venous thrombosis. However, in up to 50 % of patients with pulmonary embolism no deep-vein thrombosis is found with ultrasonography. An explanation for this low proportion is currently lack-ing. Other imaging modalities may increase the yield of detection of deep-vein thrombosis in the calf or in the abdominal region. Alternatively, not all pulmonary emboli may originate from deep-vein thromboses in the extremities. We searched for the origin of pulmonary emboli, by performing total-body magnetic resonance imag-ing-scans to visualize thrombi. Ninety-nine patients with a first pulmonary embolism confirmed by computed tomography underwent a magnetic resonance direct thrombus imaging-scan, a validated technique using endoge-nous contrast. Additionally, acquired and genetic risk factors were assessed. No thrombus was found in 55 patients, whereas a thrombus was identified in 44 patients.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{rationales}} of corporate risk management, {{as well as}} the implementation of different risk management strategies and the use of risk management instruments in Croatian and Slovenian companies have been investigated. Based on arguments arising from the review of the literature, <b>we</b> have <b>proposed</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> <b>We</b> have tested whether the decision to hedge or not, and the decision to hedge with derivatives made by Croatian and Slovenian non-financial companies, is a function of six factors – financial distress costs, agency costs, capital market imperfections and costly external financing, taxes, managerial utility maximisation and hedge substitutes. We have also tested the assumption that corporate risk management is more developed or has different rationales among Slovenian than among Croatian companies. On the basis of our research results, it could be concluded that the explored hedging rationales have little predictive power in explaining corporate risk management decisions both in Croatian and Slovenian companies. The evidence based on univariate and multivariate empirical relations between the decision to hedge or use derivatives in Croatian companies and the predicted theories of hedging fails to provide support for any of the tested hypotheses but one - capital market imperfections and costly external financing. The univariate analysis and multivariate regression conducted for Slovenian companies have revealed that there is no statistically significant explanatory variable for the decision to hedge; therefore we can conclude it is not dependent on any of the predicted theories of hedging. The decision to use derivatives, however, has been shown as dependent {{on the size of the}} company. The multivariate test has proven a positive relation between the use of derivatives and the size of Slovenian companies, which supports the informational and transactional scale economies argument that larger firms will be more likely to use derivatives. The analysis conducted to explore differences between risk management practices in Slovenian and Croatian companies has shown statistically significant evidence that Slovenian companies use all types of derivatives, especially structured derivatives, more intensively than Croatian companies. Additionally, Croatian companies use simple risk management instruments like natural hedging to a greater extent in comparison with Slovenian companies. These findings are consistent with our research prediction that Slovenian companies have more advanced risk management practices than Croatian companies...|$|R
40|$|Many finance {{theories}} {{predict that}} the capital structure affects firm value, which implies that the changes in leverage {{have an impact on}} stock returns. Most of the existing literature however has been focusing on the determinants of the capital structure. Using a sample of U. S. public firms during 1975 - 2002, we document a significantly negative effect of leverage changes on next-quarter stock returns. This effect remains significant after controlling for other firm characteristics such as ROE, book-to-market, firm size, and past returns. <b>We</b> <b>propose</b> and test <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> to explain the observed effect. We find that the negative effect is stronger for the firms with a higher leverage level. This is consistent with a dynamic view of the pecking-order model that an increase in leverage reduces firms 2 ̆ 7 debt capacity and may lead to future underinvestment. Further tests confirm the negative effect of current leverage change on future investment. In contrast, our results cannot be explained by the trade-off theory, default premium, the market timing theory, or the operational signaling story. Specifically, we find that deviation from the target leverage ratio has no impact on the stock returns, inconsistent with the trade-off theory (which implies an optimal, or partially optimal, leverage ratio). In addition, the change of long-term debt affects stock returns more than the change of short-term debt, and the one-year expected return following leverage change does not increase, both of which are inconsistent with the default risk premium hypothesis. Our results are not driven by firms 2 ̆ 7 market timing activities. A firm times the market by issuing new equity (repurchasing stocks) when its equity is over- (under-) valued, which implies a positive relation between the leverage change and stock return. We also do not find support for the view that leverage increase signals poor future operating performance. Finally, we show that the return effect of leverage change contains information that cannot be explained by the popular pricing factors. This sheds new light on the link between capital structure choice and empirical asset pricing...|$|R
40|$|The cestode Schistocephalus solidus uses copepods {{as first}} and {{sticklebacks}} as second intermediate hosts.

By giving this choice, we attempted to force the copepods to make a trade-off between the benefit of risk dilution and possible predator confusion {{and the costs of}} food competition and other disadvantages induced by conspecifics. Within 1 - 8 h after last feeding, uninfected copepods clearly preferred the odors of conspeciflcs under the chemically simulated threat of predation.

40|$|Background: Small colony {{variants}} {{have been}} implicated {{as the cause}} of several chronic disease states unmanageable by antibiotic therapy. Thus, this review evaluates the mechanisms employed by this subpopulation in the propagation of nosocomial infections involving the staphylococcal species. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>propose</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> for the evolutionary role this phenotype may play in clinical settings. Results: Research suggests that a combined effort of certain auxotrophies contributes to a reduced metabolic rate within small colony variant bacteria. This minimizes the effect of antibiotics used against them and allows this phenotype to endure as an intracellular infection. Additionally, numerous studies have suggested that perhaps these variants alter the mechanisms of the immune system that are normally fashioned against such invasive pathogens. Studies have shown that although these variants possess reduced virulence factors compared with parental strains, they exhibit an increased ability to attach and colonize intracellularly in the host cells, making eradication difficult. Conclusions: The formation of a small colony variant phenotype {{has been found to be}} a vital mode of existence for nosocomial bacteria, as it offers numerous survival options without expending valuable metabolic resources while sustaining severe chronic infections. It is suggested that intracellular survivability is the major role played by this variant. There is a need to develop clinical techniques that will be sensitive for the rapid detection and diagnosis of these variant populations. Ultimately, understanding the survival mechanisms used by these variants is imperative for the administration of suitable treatment regimens...|$|E

Spermatozoal ultrastructure reveals {{the presence of a}} glycocalyx in the peripheral region of the periopercular rim, never recorded before in crustacean sperm cells. Sperm cell morphological traits such as semi-lunar acrosome shape, centrally perforate and flat operculum, and absence of a thickened ring, are shared only with Macropodia longirostris, confirming a close phylogenetic relationship of these species and their separation from {{the other members of the}} family Majidae. Spermatozoa are transferred to females inside spermatophores of different sizes, but during ejaculate transfer, larger spermatophores might be ruptured by tooth-like structures present on the ejaculatory canal of the male first gonopod, releasing free sperm cells. Such a mechanism could represent the first evidence of a second form of sperm competition in conflict with sperm displacement, the only mechanism of sperm competition known among Brachyura, enabling paternity for both dominant and smaller, non-dominant, males.

In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol. <b>We</b> <b>propose</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> to explain why we did not observe more soybean aphid predation with the increased abundance of aphidophagous predators in catchments containing prairie...|$|E
40|$|Background: Medical device {{manufacturers}} (suppliers) {{and hospitals}} (providers) face financial and operational stressors exacerbated by recent healthcare reform. Providers now {{face the prospect}} of decreased reimbursements and financial penalties associated with quality of care metrics while suppliers must cope with product commoditization and increased scrutiny of device cost. To address these financial and operational pressures, suppliers and providers will need to uncover opportunities for cost savings and improvements in clinical care. The consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry provides insight into a vehicle for achieving such results as there exist cases in which collaboration between suppliers and customers have been able to generate financial and operational gains. Question: Given such cases of collaborative success within the CPG space and parallels in supply chain environments between the CPG and medical device industries, we ask: what are the opportunities for cost savings and operational efficiencies that can be realized via collaborative supply chain practices between medical device manufacturers and hospitals? Methodology: We implement a two-step approach to constructing a model that identifies such opportunities. First, to establish the foundational framework for this model, <b>we</b> <b>propose</b> <b>several</b> <b>hypotheses</b> (HI, H 2, H 3) that relate to the CPG and medical device domains based on existing theory as well as interviews and observations at Device Company X, a leading device manufacturer, and at Hospital X, a Harvard Medical School affiliated teaching hospital. These hypotheses are: H 1 : Shared practices between suppliers and customers can generate cost containment and operational improvements in the CPG domain. H 2 : The operating environments between CPG and medical device companies share similarities with respect to operational goals, product characteristics, and logistical pressures. H 3 : Supply chain shared practices between US medical device companies and hospitals can generate cost containment and operational efficiencies. Second, we propose a collaboration model that can be leveraged to test H 3 by building on the core principle of shared practices that underlie a pre-existing collaboration model within the CPG space. To create this model, we examined operations within a procedure suite at Hospital X. This entailed assessing the process steps required for inventory replenishment and product consumption while noting the role of Device Company X in facilitating task execution. Findings: The CPG domain and medical device industry may share similarities within their operating environments. As such, collaboration practices within the CPG space may provide a template for financial and operational solutions that medical device companies and hospitals can benefit from. Building on a prior model used within the CPG space, we propose a collaboration model with three operational levers for hospitals and device manufacturers that may represent sources for cost containment and operational efficiencies. These operational dimensions include physician practice standardization, inventory replenishment, and space utilization. Our model calls for redefining the roles of medical device company personnel within clinical care territories to include greater participation in hospital value-add activities. Next Steps: Device manufacturers and hospitals can test the feasibility of sources for cost containment and operational efficiencies within the proposed collaboration model by implementing survey based modalities to uncover enablers and barriers to collaboration. For both parties, conducting low-stakes, time friendly pilot studies offers a compelling route to "testing the waters" of collaboration. by Suman Machinani. Thesis: M. B.
