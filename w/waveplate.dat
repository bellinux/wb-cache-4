Precision control of polarization is increasingly important in disciplines such as solar polarimetry, optical communications, biomedical imaging, military target identification, chemical analysis, and wavelength filtering.

25|$|If {{the axis}} of {{polarization}} of the incident wave is chosen so that it makes a 0° with the fast or slow axes of the <b>waveplate,</b> then the polarization will not change, so remains linear. If the angle is in between 0° and 45° the resulting wave has an elliptical polarization.|$|E
25|$|A <b>waveplate</b> or {{retarder}} is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{demonstrate that}} in a laser cavity mode-locked {{by a set of}} <b>waveplates</b> and passive polarizer, the energy performance can be increased by incorporating a second set of <b>waveplates</b> and polarizer in the cavity. The two nonlinear transmission functions acting in combination can be engineered so as to suppress the multi-pulsing instability responsible for limiting the single pulse per round trip energy in a myriad of mode-locked cavities. In a single parameter sweep, the energy is demonstrated to double. It is anticipated that further engineering and optimization of the transmission functions by tuning the eight <b>waveplates,</b> fiber birefringence, two polarizers and two lengths of transmission fiber can lead to further significant increases. Moreover, the analysis suggests a general design and engineering principle that can potentially realize the goal of making fiber based lasers directly competitive with solid state devices. The technique is feasible and easy to implement without requiring a new cavity design paradigm. Department of Electronic and Information EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: P. K. A.

25|$|A <b>waveplate</b> {{works by}} {{shifting}} the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} light wave. A typical <b>waveplate</b> is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E
25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a <b>waveplate</b> (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} propagates either along or {{orthogonal}} to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations {{see the same}} effective refractive index, {{so there is no}} extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a <b>waveplate,</b> {{in which there is no}} distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a quarter-wave plate is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{birefringence}} Δn {{may vary}} slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible {{compared to the}} variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured {{to work for a}} particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order <b>waveplate.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the <b>waveplate</b> for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E

It is based on the Maltese-cross pattern, where anisotropy is induced by breaking the four-fold symmetry of the cross by displacing one of its beams.

Still, integrated devices performing single-qubit rotations are missing. Here we demonstrate waveguide-based <b>waveplates,</b> fabricated by femtosecond laser pulses, capable to effectively produce arbitrary single-qubit operations in the polarization encoding. By exploiting these novel components we fabricate and test a compact device for the quantum state tomography of two polarization-entangled photons.
