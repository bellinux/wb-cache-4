40|$|Introduction: Filtration media {{selection}} {{is dependent upon}} filtration level required and operational pressures. Traditionally, the filter portion is formed from <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> manufactured from drawn wire, arranged in a grid pattern although different weaves are available, allowing different levels of filtration using different wire diameters. The open area of the filter {{is limited by the}} wire diameters, affecting the overall strength of the woven mesh. The design freedoms of additive manufacturing (AM) allows filter media design with known aperture sizes whilst reducing equivalent wire diameter to produce filter media with a greater open area compared to the equivalent <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Method: AM filter media were designed to have aperture sizes of 500 µm and 1000 µm as found in # 32 and # 18 mesh respectively, but with a decrease in ‘wire’ diameter to increase the ratio of open area. Strength was increased through addition of further filtration layers to form depth filters. The filter media were then tested for aperture size, collapse pressure and pressure drop. Results: AM filter media designs delivered an increase in open area compared to comparable <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> media. Addition of further layers increased the filters strength and the complexity of the particulate path through the filter and so decreased the path size. Conclusions: Filter media designs produced using AM can be manipulated to produce an increase in open area, retaining strength compared to conventional <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> The increased open area decreases the pressure drop across the filter and so less pumping energy is required...|$|E

The available knowledge and instruments provide a solid base for development of test methods to determine the effectiveness of filtration media against airborne nanoparticles down to single-digit nanometer range. An interlaboratory evaluation was performed {{in the framework of}} the European Mandate M/ 461 activities, within the Technical Committee 195 of European Committee for Standardization (CEN/TC 195). The purpose was to develop a methodology to determine effectiveness of filtration media against air-borne particles in the 3 - 500 nm range. Five different laboratories (Camfil, ETH/Empa, Politecnico di Torino, University of Minnesota, Unifil) participate in the round robin test in order to verify the repeatability and reproducibility of the test method. The qualification of test rig and apparatus was performed prior of the filtration efficiency and air flow resistance measurement tests.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} are described, documenting the flow resulting from the normal impingement of planar and axisymmetric jets onto a porous surface. Six different porous surfaces with open area ratios of 23, 26, 31, 37, 44 and 54 % (? = 0. 23, 0. 26, 0. 31, 0. 37, 0. 44 and 0. 54) were placed in low speed (usually 40 m/s exit velocity) air jets sufficiently far from the jet exit for the jet to be self similar. The ?= 0. 31, 0. 37, 0. 44 and 0. 54 surfaces were <b>wove</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Exit Reynolds number based on jet exit diameter is 3 x 104 for the axisymmetric case and based on exit width from 0. 5 x 104 to 2. 1 x 104 for the planar case. For ?= 0. 44 and ?= 0. 54 the impingement of the jet for both planar and axisymmetric geometries can be summarised as a widening of the jet as it passes through the mesh, followed by a region of reduced entrainment. For ?= 0. 37 and below, {{there is evidence of}} wall jets on the upstream side of the surface. For the ?= 0. 31 mesh and ?= 0. 26 perforated plate, there are marked differences between the axisymmetric and planar cases. For the planar cases the flow is turned downstream of the porous surface away from the centreline such that on the centreline the axial velocity falls to zero, whilst a clear jet remains in the axisymmetric cases. Downstream of the ?= 0. 23 porous surface there is a clear bounded jet in both planar and axisymmetric cases.

40|$|Traditional {{metal filters}} are {{manufactured}} from perforated plate {{and one or}} more layers of <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> The perforated plate forms the support portion of the filter, and delivers the overall strength of the filter to withstand operational pressures. The <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> forms the filter portion with the aperture size chosen to suit the required level of filtration. An ideal filter would have the maximum open area possible to minimise the filters’ resistance when in situ in the conduit. However maximising the open area decreases the overall strength of the filter and so open area must be compromised to deliver the required strength. The design freedoms and capabilities of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides the opportunity to design novel filter media that are depth filters with x-, y- and z- planes with integrated support portion and filter portion. This filter mesh has a defined aperture size and by reducing the equivalent wire diameter, these novel filter media have a greater open area compared to the equivalent <b>woven</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> This potentially reduces the pressure drop across the filter and so reduces pumping energy requirements. In preliminary studies AM filter media have been designed using a repeating node unit to form the latticework of the AM filters. Previous test samples demonstrated that this AM integrated filter support and filter portion design decreased the pressure drop across the filter compared to conventional filter design. The aim is to develop the integrated support and filter AM design to incorporate different sizes of repeating nodes, with a larger node providing strength and the smaller node providing the filtration level. It has been possible to develop two node structures to deliver two latticeworks, one with a 1000 μm aperture {{and the other with}} 500 μm aperture. Filter disks comprising of 1, 2 and 3 layers of the individual nodes were tested for strength by collapse pressure. Conical filters were designed and tested for each individual node and for combination of nodes, i. e. layer of 500 μm and 1000 μm. These AM integrated filter supports and filter portion conical filters were tested for strength: collapse pressure and their pressure drop. The pressure drop across these novel AM integrated filters was largest for the AM 500 μm aperture filter alone and least in the AM 1000 μm filter. Combination of repeating nodes of both 1000 μm and 500 μm in one single filter delivered a decreased pressure drop across the filter compared to the AM 500 μm filter with 500 μm apertures alone. The integrated filter support and filter support portion AM design filters shown here have the potential to decrease the end users pumping energy requirements and so reduce energy costs and the end users carbon footprint...|$|E

However, in spite of the similarities between the two materials there are still major differences, indicating that ferrocement requires a separate study to establish its structural performances. On the other hand, although a large amount of research has been carried out on ferrocement, its flexural behaviour is still not fully understood. The aim of this investigation is to study the structural behaviour of ferrocement plates under flexural loading and the influence of the different variables on the strength and deformation characteristics.
