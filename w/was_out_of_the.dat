The certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question.

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop <b>is</b> a form {{of partial}} ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop can <b>be</b> eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first politician to arrive at his home.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year {{on the grounds that}} the site was already overdeveloped.

5|$|In 1862 {{he became}} brigadier general. After a brief cavalry command he was reassigned to infantry. Wounded at Cross Keys, Steuart <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war {{for almost a}} year while {{recovering}} from a shoulder injury. He was reassigned to Lee's army shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg. Steuart was captured at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and exchanged in the summer of 1864. He held a command in the Army of Northern Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war. Steuart was among the officers with Robert E. Lee when he surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question {{as many of}} the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, as industrial targets in Japan were {{well beyond the}} range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a {{tour of duty in}} Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October the {{majority}} of the 3rd Division was removed from the line for rest and reorganisation, although a number of its artillery batteries would continue to support the operations of the II American Corps until they were withdrawn. Following this they continued to participate in the fighting in support of the British 6th Division. The 27th Battery fired the division's last shot of the war on 4 November at Wassigny. Nevertheless, the division <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line when news of the Armistice came on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began and as men were repatriated back to Australia, the division was eventually disbanded on 28 May 1919.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|Since gaining {{air superiority}} over U.S. forces <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, the {{northern}} leadership decided {{to implement a}} policy of air deniability. At {{the beginning of the}} campaign, North Vietnam possessed approximately 1,500 anti-aircraft weapons, most of which were of the light 37 and 57mm variety. Within one year, however, the U.S. estimated that the number had grown to over 5,000 guns, including 85 and 100mm radar-directed weapons. That estimate was later revised downward from a high of 7,000 in early 1967 to less than a thousand by 1972. Regardless, during Rolling Thunder, 80 percent of U.S. aircraft losses were attributed to anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{enormous}} territorial {{gains of}} the Palestine offensive {{contrasted with the}} British Expeditionary Force's offensive on the Western Front at Cambrai. Fought in Flanders from 20 to 30 November, it ended with heavy losses and no gains. The French army was still recovering from a serious mutiny, the Italians were defeated at the Battle of Caporetto, and Russia <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war following the Bolshevik Revolution. Allenby's advance by comparison made considerable territorial gains, helped secure Baghdad and the oilfields at Basra in Mesopotamia, encouraged the Arab Revolt, and inflicted irreplaceable losses on the Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} Cristina Fernández de Kirchner <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{country at}} the moment, and although she arranged an early return, she could {{not return to the}} country in time for the funeral. As a result, the vice president Julio Cobos arranged the state funeral of Alfonsín, alongside Eduardo Fellner (president of the Chamber of deputies) and José Pampuro (acting president of the Senate). His widow, former First Lady of Argentina María Lorenza Barreneche, was unable to attend her husband's public state funeral due to her own declining health.|$|E

5|$|While Sihanouk <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{country on}} a trip to France, anti-Vietnamese rioting (which was semi-sponsored by the government) took place in Phnom Penh, during which the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong {{embassies}} were sacked. In the prince's absence, Lon Nol did nothing to halt these activities. On 12th, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest in joining the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week. On the January 5 episode of Raw, Snuka and Rhodes won a tag team match against Cryme Tyme. Before the match, Orton informed them that they had to win the match in order {{to be part of the}} group. After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E
