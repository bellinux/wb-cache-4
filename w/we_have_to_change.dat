500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it." ...|$|E

Adventure is the champagne of life, but I prefer my champagne and my adventures dry. Here is the station." ...|$|E
60|$|We may learn, first; {{not to be}} astonished, if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> our {{opinions}} as we grow older. When we are young, we {{are very}} positive about this thing and that, as St. Paul was; violent in favour of our own opinions; ready to quarrel with any one who differs from us, as St. Paul was. But let ten years, twenty years, roll over our heads, and we may find our opinions utterly changed, as St. Paul did, and look back with astonishment on ourselves, for having been foolish enough to believe what we did, as St. Paul looked back; and with shame, as did St. Paul likewise, at having said so many violent and unjust things against people, who, we now see, were in the right after all.|$|E

Our intentions were to fight {{a long time and}} cause heavy casualties to the United States, so the United States would see that the war was unwinnable and would leave.|$|R
