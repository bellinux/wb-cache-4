25|$|Like {{many other}} women in the Hebrew Bible, the two women in this story are anonymous. Perhaps their names have not been {{mentioned}} so that they would not overshadow Solomon's wisdom, which is the main theme of the story. The <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be poor. They live alone in a shared residence, without servants. As prostitutes, they lack male patronage and {{have to take care of}} themselves in a patriarchal society.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{have had a lot of}} control over their lives, their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E
25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{representation}} as {{a mother}} also received criticism. Wilson viewed negatively Melanie's decision {{to have an abortion}} in an attempt to reconcile with Derwin, and criticized the show's depiction of an abortion causing Melanie to become barren as based on [...] "a link that is not medically solid". In her 2015 book Representations of Black Women in the Media: The Damnation of Black Womanhood, California State University associate professor Marquita Marie Gammage felt that the character was perpetuating negative images of black motherhood on television. Gammage criticized the series for showing Melanie becoming a wife [...] "at the expanse of her career and possibility of bear her own children" [...] and portraying her as unable to care for her stepson. She contrasted Melanie to white characters on television, writing that [...] "white <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> achieve it all and control their realities on their own terms".|$|E
2500|$|Taíno women {{played an}} {{important}} role in intercultural interaction between Spaniards and the Taino people. When Taíno men were fighting intervention from other groups, women were left back home turning into the primary food producers or ritual specialists. <b>Women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have [...] participated in all levels of the Taíno political hierarchy, they went up to occupy roles as high up as being caciques. This meant that Taíno women could potentially give permission to other Taíno men and women to take on important tasks and that they could too make important choices for the village. There is evidence that suggests that the women who were wealthier among the tribe collected crafted goods that they would then use for trade or as gifts.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{writing to}} FEMM's music {{material}} explore themes of girl power, feminism, {{and freedom of}} speech; two examples are the tracks [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] and [...] "Girls Night Out", which lyrically discusses female empowerment and not relying on male labor or assistance. Honey-B commented to an interviewer at Arama! Japan by stating, [...] "We {{leave it to the}} listeners to decide about the message or feel of this track, but as for FEMM, they’re singing about “girl power”. Itʼs okay to be sexy, just donʼt let them take advantage of you. [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] has very aggressive lyrics, but lots of <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> relate to it. They call it their life anthem." [...] For their first extended play Astroboy, both members did not yet have any professional experience in singing. The duo stated that the first time recording and appearing in a music video as their agents was challenging. FEMM expressed that they would be honored to collaborate with any producers and songwriters who understand their message. Molly Osberg from Vice noted that FEMM combined Japanese fashion and music together. She commented [...] "At least, that's how I imagine we get acts like FEMM, the mesmerizing J-pop electro duo with a backstory more inventive than anything on the SyFy channel right now." [...] Osberg praised the producers and songwriters for being hidden pioneers in order to popularize the group, as she felt producers now were more [...] "the frontmen". Corynn Smith from MTV Iggy was impressed by their English language skills and commented [...] "The pair’s overwhelmingly English discography has something for everyone with electronic taste, whether you’re feeling like a romantic trance trip a la [...] "We Flood the Night", craving a techno remix of '70s J-pop hit [...] "UFO", or in a twerk-tastic, rubber-maid-outfit-clad [...] "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" [...] kinda mood." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify the profile of aged residents in an Elderly Long Staying Institution; to develop actions of nursing/health that can contribute for a better quality of life of the aged people. It was an Exploratory, descriptive, diagnosis of an evaluation study, carried out in Rio Grande/RS, using the multidimensional evaluation of the elderly people applied for the structuralized interview, in 55 residents.

6000|$|Philadelphia.--An old place, full of Dutch women, in [...] "bellus top" [...] bonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets. Every {{one seems}} to be {{scrubbing}} their white steps. All the houses look like tidy jails, with their outside shutters. Several have crape on the door-handles, and many have flags flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and the <b>women</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for its being so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know what they are.
