The VVS, although faced with the same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, {{and the fact that}} they were operating from intact airbases and airports.

A reduction in the diversity of baleen whales and a shift in their distribution toward polar regions may have reduced megalodon's primary food source. The extinction of the shark appeared to affect other animals; for example, the size of baleen whales increased significantly after the shark had disappeared.|$|E
