40|$|Work {{and family}} embody {{two of the}} most {{fundamental}} areas of adult life. The increased participation in the labour force of <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children has had a major impact on the work and family interface. Theories of work and family have been incorporated to analyse potential relationships of conflict with undesirable work outcomes such as reduced job satisfaction and burnout. The study investigates whether work-family conflict ultimately leads to <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children’s experiences of burnout and lower job satisfaction. The research study also explores the effects of the mother-role identity on the manifestation of family and work conflict in <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children and posits that <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children experience role salience differently from other <b>working</b> <b>women</b> without children. The study employed a quantitative research design using electronic self-administered questionnaires. Using the data from 545 employees in a fast-moving consumer goods industry showed that <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children who identified closer with the mother-role identity, experienced greater work-family conflict. The mother-role identity forms a greater part of <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children’s self than that of the employee-role identity and the results infer that role identity plays a significant role when conflict is experienced. In <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children, strong relationships were found between family-work conflict and burnout, and moderate inverse relationships between work-family conflict and job satisfaction. Work-family conflict may ultimately lead <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children to experience higher burnout and lower job satisfaction owing to their preoccupation with family-related responsibilities. The concept of role identity is introduced as a significant variable to consider into the work and family conflict investigation, {{as well as in the}} development of burnout and job satisfaction for <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children. The current research also assists in understanding the work and family role integration of <b>working</b> <b>women</b> with children and provides a consolidated overview of the current work and family theories within a conceptual and unifying model. This research offers an explanatory model that outlines the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, by investigating the mechanisms by virtue of which such relationships exist.

Women both found work in the munitions factories (as [...] "munitionettes") despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in female employment is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work.
