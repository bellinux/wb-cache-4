50|$|File <b>wiping</b> {{utilities}} {{are used to}} delete individual files from an operating system. The advantage of file <b>wiping</b> utilities {{is that they can}} accomplish their task in a relatively short amount of time as opposed to disk cleaning utilities which take much longer. Another advantage of file <b>wiping</b> utilities is that they generally leave a much smaller signature than disk cleaning utilities. There are two primary disadvantages of file <b>wiping</b> utilities, first they require user involvement in the process and second some experts believe that file <b>wiping</b> programs don't always correctly and completely <b>wipe</b> file information. Some of the widely used file <b>wiping</b> utilities include BCWipe, R-Wipe & Clean, Eraser, Aevita <b>Wipe</b> & Delete and CyberScrubs PrivacySuite.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female and <b>wipes</b> its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E

Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E

It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet <b>wipes,</b> with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a strategy}} {{by which a}} robotic hand can use the physical properties of a fabric to pinch the fabric. Pinching may be accomplished by using a <b>wiping</b> motion, during which the movement and deformation of a deformable object occur simultaneously. The <b>wiping</b> motion differs from the displacement of a deformable object. During the <b>wiping</b> motion, there is contact, but no relative movement, between the manipulator and the object, whereas, during displacement, there is both contact and relative movement between the object and the floor. This paper first describes <b>wiping</b> motion and distinguishes <b>wiping</b> slide from <b>wiping</b> deformation by displacement of the internal points of an object. <b>Wiping</b> motion is also shown to be an extended scheme of pushing and sliding of rigid objects. Our strategy for pinching a fabric is accomplished {{with a combination of}} <b>wiping</b> deformation and residual deformation of the fabric under unloaded conditions. Using this strategy, a single-armed robotic hand can pinch both surfaces of the fabric without handover motion...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{difference}} between patients with cerebrovascular accident hemiplegia (CVA) and healthy volunteers in <b>wiping</b> movement after excretion. The authors analyzed the movement of defecation by observation and questionnaire. The results show that there were six types of <b>wiping</b> movement in healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference in <b>wiping</b> types between healthy volunteers and CVA. Most CVA <b>wiped</b> with paper after excretion, in the sitting position from the front, while there were a variety of types among healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was a gender difference in <b>wiping</b> movement; the male <b>wiped</b> from the back whereas the female had the tendency to <b>wipe</b> from the front. It was infered that this difference was the influence of external genitals. It was suggested that it is necessary to consider the type of <b>wiping</b> before the onset of CVA of each patient when an occupational therapist perform the training operation of defecation for the CVA...|$|R

5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The {{first part of}} the book focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus with his parents Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, and the birth of their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to destroy their civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which <b>wipes</b> out many of the D'ni and follows them through the Ages. Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two of them would have been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E

She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex").

40|$|Following the serendipitous {{capture of}} the bathyal {{gastropod}} Calliostoma (Otukaia) alertae, observations were made to determine if it would <b>wipe</b> the surface of its shell with its foot, a phenomenon know as shell <b>wiping</b> and only recorded in four other gastropod species, all Calliostomatids. C. alertae <b>wiped</b> its shell at least once every 24 h, in an identical manner recorded for other species. Because of its bathyal habitat and lack of shell fouling, it is concluded that shell <b>wiping</b> in C. alertae probably functions to reduce shell fouling and/or to reduce any predation pressure.

On Day 302, the Bolivian Army <b>wipes</b> out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Earth in which sapient birds have seemingly taken the place of humans in society {{for reasons that are}} hinted at, but not fully explained in the dating simulation portion of the game. In Bad Boys Love, it is revealed that Hatoful is set in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian future—in which a pandemic of a deadly, mutated strain of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, nearly <b>wipes</b> out mankind in the year 2068. The release of a counter-virus, cultivated to destroy the virus' avian carriers {{in a desperate attempt to}} stop the spread of the disease, ends up backfiring as birds who resisted the counter-virus instead developed human-level intelligence. War soon breaks out between the newly uplifted birds and the remnants of humanity, resulting in birds emerging as the planet's new dominant lifeforms as humans continued to succumb to the disease. Following several terrorist attacks by a human insurgency, all remaining humans have been forced to live in the wilderness away from civilization in a form of apartheid-like segregation.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it <b>wipes</b> around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{the last}} {{original}} novel in the series, begins directly {{after the events}} of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety {{as well as that of}} their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione <b>wipes</b> her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.|$|E
