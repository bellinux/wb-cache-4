2500|$|The , Jeremy Corbyn, {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of renationalising public utilities, such as British Rail and energy companies back into public ownership. He also ignited controversy within his party when, {{in an interview with}} The Independent on Sunday, he said that: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> about what the objectives of the party are, whether that’s restoring the Clause Four as it was originally written or it’s a different one, but I think we shouldn’t shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways. I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail". Although this has been seen by some as an endorsement for the reinstatement of Clause IV, Corbyn denies this and says that more discussion within his party is needed.|$|E

The recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} Milk Studios in Manhattan, New York, Metropolis Studios in London, England, Studios Davout in Paris, France and at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Rihanna worked with several different songwriters and producers on the album, including Chuck Harmony, The-Dream, Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart, Chase & Status, StarGate, Demo, and Justin Timberlake. Rihanna wanted the album to be less influenced by synthpop, attempting to avoid the lighthearted commercial pop of her previous albums. By doing so, she incorporated a production style with more bass, and utilized Gothic imagery. In {{the early stages of}} the production, she worked with Adonis Shropshire, who stated that Rihanna had brainstormed a large number of ideas over the course of a few weeks. Rihanna also worked with Norwegian producer duo StarGate, who mused that the collaboration was [...] "very rewarding" [...] and [...] "inspiring for us", commenting: [...] "I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>talk</b> about titles just yet. We don't really know which songs are gonna make it, but it feels exciting." [...] It was later revealed that StarGate originally produced a collaboration between Rihanna and Canadian rapper Drake.
