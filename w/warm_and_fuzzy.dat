Monica Herrera of Billboard commended the song and said that it [...] "should appeal to some older listeners."

500|$|Mouna Ragam {{provides}} {{insight into}} the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce and how societies need to view the desires of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared the film to J. Mahendran's Nenjathai Killathe (1980), another {{story of a woman}} torn between the man she loves and the man she marries, Antha Ezhu Naatkal (1981) and its Hindi remake, Woh Saat Din (1983). Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted that one thing differentiating Mouna Ragam from Antha Ezhu Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam a [...] "chick flick", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce split them; according to him, [...] "chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> denouement".|$|E

500|$|Hal Hinson of The Washington Post {{gave the}} {{character}} a negative review. Labeling Timon and Pumbaa the only interesting characters in The Lion King, Hinson questioned Simba's {{role as the}} film's hero. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times agreed, [...] "A movie's heroes may have their names above the title, but often as not it's the sidekicks who get the real work done." [...] Turan went on to pan Simba, describing him as [...] "irritatingly callow." [...] Chris Hick of the Deseret News complained {{about the fact that}} Simba and the other [...] "characters in The Lion King are not as <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuzzy</b> as other Disney animated features," [...] crediting this with making [...] "the film a bit tougher to warm [...] to." [...] ComingSoon.net strongly panned Simba as a lead character, writing, [...] "typically for Disney animated fare, it's the hero who is the weak link being both blandly designed and blandly performed." [...] Acknowledging the character's Shakespearean origins, The Baltimore Suns Stephen Hunter gave Simba a negative review, writing, [...] "Alas ...Simba stands in for Hamlet, but he's a lot less complicated; in fact, he's less complicated than Morris the Cat or Sylvester." [...] Hunter continued, [...] "Simba the Exile is even less interesting than Simba the Prince." [...] Christopher Null of Contactmusic.com was critical of Weaver's performance as the singing voice of Young Simba, writing, [...] "If there's anything annoying about the film, it's the singing. Young Simba sounds like a young Michael Jackson ... You almost don't want him to succeed." [...] However, Null reacted more positively towards Broderick's performance.|$|E

[...] The season's penultimate entry, [...] "A.A.R.M.", received a glowing response from many critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode was [...] "surprisingly... terrific in most areas." [...] Roth Cornet of IGN noted that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been {{the core of the}} series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] The series finale, in particular, was praised by critics. Sepinwall called it [...] "a tremendously satisfying conclusion to a show that could make us gasp with laughter, but that could also make us cry or smile". Cornet wrote that it [...] "was a strong hour of television [...] the finale shone and delivered on all of its promise." [...] Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series. Other episodes were not received as positively. [...] "Lice", for instance, was called [...] "terrible" [...] by Campbell, as well as the [...] "epitome of filler" [...] by Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review. [...] "The Farm" [...] was largely derided due to its uneven nature, and the broad humor that it used.|$|E

5000|$|A Warm Fuzzy Tale is a 1970 children's book by Steiner. The fairy tale-like story {{introduces}} {{children to}} [...] "strokes" [...] and other ideas about social interaction and emotion derived from transactional analysis. It was republished in 1977 as The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale with illustration by Jo Ann Dick, {{and has since}} been translated into multiple languages. The slang term warm fuzzies, a reference to positive feelings, derives from the book and its adaptations. The story and ideas derived from it are sometimes used in teaching or counseling about emotion and interaction. In the story, people exchange things called [...] "warm fuzzies" [...] which make them feel happy <b>and</b> <b>warm.</b> A bad witch convinces one character that warm fuzzies are in limited supply {{and should not be}} given away. Instead, the witch induces people to exchange [...] "cold pricklies" [...] which make them feel cold. These exchanges symbolize Steiner and Eric Berne's notion of [...] "strokes", recognition and emotional support among people.
