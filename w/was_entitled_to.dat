5|$|Gellers was {{representing}} the Passamaquoddy pursuant to a 10% contingency fee agreement. Gellers, in turn, had assigned 40% of his fee to Bottomly.

When Bottomly's appeal came before the First Circuit in 1979, Maine filed an amicus brief arguing that the tribe <b>was</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> no such immunity. The First Circuit rejected this argument. A similar suit by Gellerswho had since been disbarred and changed his name to Tuvia Ben Shmuel Yosefwas thrown out in 1989.|$|E

The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.|$|E

Each member state <b>was</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> one {{of each of the}} remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.|$|E

This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie <b>was</b> <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
