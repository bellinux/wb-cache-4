After a lengthy knife fight, Mardjan's foot is caught in the railroad tracks, and he is soon killed by a passing train. Doerachman, pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> his wealth, destroys the letter and grants Rachmat permission to marry Atikah.|$|E

For example, between 15 March and 15 August 1944, the SDS lost 157 men killed, 107 wounded and 26 missing. By August 1944, SDS units were responding to Mihailović's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} link between the voters' support for {{publicly}} financed education and the retirement system. We show that, when the pension system includes a redistributive component, the support for publicly financed education increases the greater the degree of redistribution provided by the system. Furthermore, support also increases the greater the proportion of income that finances pensions (i. e., the pension system's generosity). This occurs because adults adjust their behaviour in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> education of the young on their future pensions...|$|R

However, there is no meaningful relationship between earning and cash flows <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expected <b>return</b> <b>of</b> stock. <b>The</b> result was that the informational content test didn’t support the value relation of earning and cash flows.

After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> Belt to first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time}} in his career.

5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he achieved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in {{the first edition of}} Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E

Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898.

5|$|S. g. ashbyi, (critically endangered), {{the western}} Victorian pied currawong, was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1913. It is threatened by hybridization with the neighbouring subspecies nebulosa whose range is expanding westwards. A 2000 estimate placed the number of breeding birds at around 250. It resembles subspecies nebulosa, with sooty plumage, a long tail and a short bill. There is some doubt over whether ashbyi, which is little known, is a distinct subspecies or a colour morph of nebulosa. It {{is thought to have}} evolved after the two populations became separated by basalt plains in western Victoria, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> trees after the abandonment of regular Aboriginal burning in the late 18th century contributing to the remixing of populations.
