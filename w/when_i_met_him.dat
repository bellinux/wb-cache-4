5|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> for {{the first}} time he was a few years younger than I am now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
500|$|Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley {{during this}} period in Las Vegas, where she {{was working as a}} showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> I {{mentioned}} to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E
500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper made {{a public}} {{statement}} on March 20, 2008, saying, [...] "Canada shares the concerns {{about what is}} happening in Tibet. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama told me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and as he has been saying recently, his message is one of non-violence and [...] and I join him in that call. Canada calls upon China to fully respect human rights and peaceful protest." [...] Canada also calls on China to show [...] "restraint in dealing with this difficult situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pre-production work on {{the film}} began in early 2007 when Shree Ashtavinayak Cinevision Ltd {{announced}} that director Imtiaz Ali would be directing the then real life couple Shahid and Kareena Kapoor in their first [...] "full-fledged romantic drama". When Ali began casting for the film, Kareena Kapoor was the director's first choice to portray the role of Geet Dhillon whilst actor Bobby Deol was the first choice {{for the role of}} Aditya Kashyap but Shahid replaced Bobby after Ali met him and discovered the actor was more than a poster boy. On the two lead actors, Ali commented, [...] "I wanted a girl who could look natural in scenes where she misses the train. She had to be without make-up, someone who could be hyper, talkative and interesting but not irritating. I was never a fan of her [...] and hadn't seen too many of her flicks, but I just knew Kareena was perfect as Geet [...] , <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> , I realised he wasn't the forgettable actor that he comes across in several of his movies. He has gone through a lot in life and that maturity had never been brought out. He was perfect for the role of a young, mature, quiet guy." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have never}} {{cared for the}} Master of Ravenswood, or fetched his hat {{out of the water}} since he dropped it there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last <b>met</b> <b>him</b> (circa 1825).|$|R
60|$|One may imagine, then, my {{extraordinary}} {{interest in}} <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> actually <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in the flesh. Yet the thing came about quite simply, indeed more by accident than by design, an adventure open to all.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} seen <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> mamma. <b>I</b> hardly knew him, he looked so thin and worn; but {{during the last three}} weeks he has filled out again, and he {{seems to me to be}} looking quite himself." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{reminded}} me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> that he {{had always}} predicted I would get along in life....|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old Squiffy {{was always}} rather-a lad for the wassail-bowl. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Paris, I remember, {{he was quite}} tolerably blotto." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply this," [...] {{answered}} Richard. [...] "That I knew of {{what had}} happened in New York, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> this morning I cowhided him. Ugh!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ron Perlman as the Reman Viceroy. He and Hardy {{became friends}} on the set, with Perlman saying in an {{interview}} eight years {{after the release of}} the film, [...] "I loved <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> loved working with him. I found him to be really smart, really a great kid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot quite explain, uncle. To begin with, I don't {{seem to get}} any {{nearer to}} him--I mean to what he really is. I know more of his adventures and his life than I did, but I know no more of him himself than I did three months ago <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at dinner." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had known}} each other years ago. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him</b> his offices {{consisted}} of a back room up three flights of stairs in a dingy by-street off the Strand, which has since disappeared. We occasionally dined together, in those days, at a restaurant in Great Portland Street, for one and nine. Our acquaintanceship was of sufficient standing to allow of such a question.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Hugh, I forget nothing: neither <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> nor how I married him, {{nor any of}} {{the events}} that have {{happened}} since. My memory, unfortunately, is very good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So am I. Mowbray Smith {{looked me}} all over, {{and asked me}} after Clement, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> just now in the street, {{as if he had}} some malice in his head.' ...|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{joined us}} at this point. (He {{was waiting for}} her outside a draper's shop <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him.)</b> He {{explained}} to her that I was going to Germany, and she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{imperfect}} prescriptions have quieted {{the mind}} of the man to whom he sent them. This wretch's distrust has long since falsely suspected me of some professional rivalry pursued in secret; the feeling showed itself again, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with <b>him</b> by accident on the night of my return to London. Since Mr. Null has communicated with him, the landlady is no longer insulted by his visits, and offended by his questions--all relating to the course of treatment which I was pursuing upstairs.|$|R
50|$|Lombardy states:Since Bobby, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at age 11Â½...stated that {{he would}} be world chess champion, I {{believed}} it was my job as his friend and confidant to do everything legitimately in my power to ensure that the young player's dream would come true!...I voluntarily served as Bobby's coach and second at the 1958 Portoroz Interzonal, when Bobby, at age 15, qualified for the world championship candidates' tournament and thus became the youngest Grandmaster ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Campbell had {{the same}} good spirits and love of merriment as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> [...] <b>met</b> <b>him</b> before,--the same desire to amuse {{everybody}} about him; but [...] still I could see, as I partly saw then, that he labours under the [...] burden of an extraordinary reputation, too easily acquired, and feels [...] too constantly {{that it is necessary}} for him to make an exertion to [...] satisfy expectation. The consequence is that, though he is always [...] amusing, he is not always quite natural." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at present, at any rate," [...] Rochester answered. [...] "I really {{forget what}} {{he used to}} do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> first. As a matter of fact, I have seen very little of him lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But in that case," [...] said March, frowning, [...] "at {{what sort}} of unearthly hour in the morning was the murder really committed? It was barely {{daylight}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at the bridge, and that's some way above the island." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> {{one night}} in the cloak room of the club putting on his {{raincoat}} and his galoshes with a peculiar beaming look on his face, I {{knew that he was}} up to some sort of benevolence.|$|E
60|$|Algie kicked {{from the}} first. I ought {{to tell you}} that since we left England he has taken up {{painting}} footling little pictures, and has got the artistic temperament badly. All his life he's been starting some new fool thing. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him</b> he prided himself on having the finest collection of photographs of race-horses in England. Then he got a craze for model engines. After that he used to work the piano player till I nearly went crazy. And now it's pictures.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would not}} suit me," [...] said Olive. [...] "I have waited and waited {{just as long}} as I can. It is as likely as not that he has {{concluded}} that he can not do anything here which will be of service to any one, and has started off to finish his vacation at some place where people won't bother him with their own affairs. He told me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him</b> that {{he was on his way}} North. And now, would you like me to tell you what I have determined to do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Botha shouldn't {{have been}} banned for it, nowhere near it. I don't have any complaints. He just cleared {{me out of the}} ruck and I got caught. Everyone counter-rucks {{nowadays}} and, if anything, I was in the wrong place. He just hit me and I was unlucky. So I was surprised to see he got banned. I know we didn't cite him so I don't know why the independent commissioner did. It was just a fair ruck from a hard player. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>him</b> before he seems like a tidy enough bloke so I'm not seeing it as anything malicious." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in the {{tax office}} I thought maybe I could make {{something}} again, but I could not. But I had not any idea I could when I came, and {{as it turned out}} I did get off entirely free.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] she proceeded. [...] "I {{am going}} to do a wrong thing; but there is no help for it. I {{am going to}} break a sacred promise. You {{remember}} that moonlight night <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> on the garden walk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I don't {{suppose it}} did me any harm {{with him to}} suppose that I still had a {{newspaper}} connection. I put Boston Abstract on my card--for purposes of identification, as the editors say--because I was writing for it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Boston." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the hour}} {{appointed}} he came; {{and as she}} observed before, so it was plain still, {{that he had been}} drinking, though very far from what we call being in drink. He appeared exceeding pleased to see me, and entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair. I begged his pardon very often for my share of it, protested I had not any such design <b>when</b> first <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him,</b> that <b>I</b> had not gone out with him but that I took him for a very civil gentleman, and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me.|$|R
6000|$|I saw {{no more of}} him {{for nearly}} a week. <b>When</b> next <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> it was in Gracechurch Street with a billbook chained to his waist. Business took him over London Bridge and I {{accompanied}} him. He was very full {{of the importance of}} that book and magnified it. As we passed over the Thames we paused to look at a steamer' unloading great slabs of white and brown marble. A barge drifted under the steamer's stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed. Charlie's face changed {{from the face of the}} bank-clerk to that of an unknown and--though he would not have believed this--a much shrewder man. He flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge, and laughing very loudly, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{never told}} me," [...] she answered. [...] "He didn't tell me much. But he was very, {{very good to}} me. I was at the refreshment-room at London Bridge <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>him.</b> He used {{to come in and}} see me every day. Then he began to take me out, and at last he found me a little house down at Putney, and I was so happy. I had been so tired all my life," [...] she added, with a little sigh, [...] "and down there I did nothing but rest and rest and wait for him to come. It was too good to last, of course, but I didn't think it would end like this!" ...|$|R
