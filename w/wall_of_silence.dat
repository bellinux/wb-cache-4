5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>Silence,</b> a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E

He gained a reputation for expertise in this area, and later began playing a more international role as a result. Shields first came to Jamaica at the request of Allan Brown of London's Metropolitan Police Service to aid in the investigation of Reneto Adams and four other policemen charged with 7 May 2003 murder of four civilians at Kraal, Clarendon Parish. Shields was successful in breaking a <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> from the Jamaican police, persuading four officers to testify against their colleagues; however, the prosecutor was unable to secure a conviction, in an acquittal widely viewed as corrupt by the Jamaican public.|$|E
25|$|A {{phone call}} on October 22, 1969, {{answered}} by freelance investigative journalist, Seymour Hersh, and his subsequent independent inquiry, broke the <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> that was surrounding the My Lai massacre. Hersh initially {{tried to sell}} the story to Life and Look magazines; both turned it down. Hersh {{then went to the}} small Washington-based Dispatch News Service, which sent it to fifty major American newspapers; thirty of them accepted it for publication. New York Times reporter Henry Kamm investigated further and found several My Lai massacre survivors in South Vietnam. He estimated the number of killed civilians as 567. Next, Ben Cole published an article about Ronald Ridenhour, a helicopter gunner and an Army whistleblower, who was among the first started to uncover the truth about the My Lai massacre. Joseph Eszterhas of The Plain Dealer, who was a friend of Ronald Haeberle and knew about the photo evidence of the massacre, published the grisly images of the dead bodies of old men, women, and children on November 20, 1969. Time magazine's article on November 28, 1969 and in Life magazine on December 5, 1969, finally brought My Lai to the fore of the public debate about Vietnam War.|$|E

2500|$|Suicide {{rates are}} growing {{worldwide}} {{and over the}} last thirty years there has been international research trying to curb this phenomenon and gather knowledge about who is [...] "at-risk". When a parent loses their child through suicide it is traumatic, sudden and affects all loved ones impacted by this child. Suicide leaves many unanswered questions and leaves most parents feeling hurt, angry and deeply saddened by such a loss. Parents may feel they can't openly discuss their grief and feel their emotions because of how their child died and how the people around them may perceive the situation. Parents, family members and service providers have all confirmed the unique nature of suicide-related bereavement following the loss of a child. They report a <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> that goes up around them and how people interact towards them. One {{of the best ways to}} grieve and move on from this type of loss is to find ways to keep that child as an active part of their lives. It might be privately at first but as parents move away from the silence they can move into a more proactive healing time.|$|E

This study addresses the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> between children and parents; teachers and learners and between boys and girls, on matters of gender, sexuality and HIV/AIDS. Within these walls, youth construct and re-construct their roles as either feminine or masculine.

Using interviews and focus group discussions, a tri-site study was carried out in Kenya, and the findings presented illustrate how boys and girls construct their identities, negotiating, adapting to and resisting common articulations of masculinity and femininity.

40|$|Cellulose, the {{important}} structural compound <b>of</b> cell <b>walls,</b> provides strength and rigidity to cells of numerous organisms. Here, we functionally characterize four cellulose synthase genes (CesA) in the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato (Solanum tuberosum) late blight. Three {{members of this}} new protein family contain Pleckstrin homology domains and form a distinct phylogenetic group most {{closely related to the}} cellulose synthases of cyanobacteria. Expression of all four genes is coordinately upregulated during pre- and early infection stages of potato. Inhibition of cellulose synthesis by 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile leads to a dramatic {{reduction in the number of}} normal germ tubes with appressoria, severe disruption <b>of</b> the cell <b>wall</b> in the preinfection structures, and a complete loss <b>of</b> pathogenicity. <b>Silencing</b> <b>of</b> the entire gene family in P. infestans with RNA interference leads to a similar disruption <b>of</b> the cell <b>wall</b> surrounding appressoria and an inability to form typical functional appressoria.

40|$|The same concept on whistleblowing is {{described}} differently in different countries, carrying negative, neutral or positive connotations. Main {{objective of this}} research paper is to offer a comprehensive view on international instruments on whistleblower protection and their influence on the drafting of the new Albanian Whistleblower Protection Law. A significant amount of knowledge about hidden forms of wrongdoing {{is based on the}} reports of whistleblowers, which means that whistleblowing plays a vital role in providing information that would otherwise have remained behind closed doors in a cloud of secrecy. People who reveal corruption from inside their organization are often faced with disbelief, anger and opposition; they are considered traitors who gave away internal secrets to the outside world. It is extremely difficult to break the <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> and to come forward with information knowing that such an action will seriously damage one’s reputation, collegiality, friendships and the trust of others. This is why whistleblowing is so remarkable: it discloses information not only about misconduct, but also about the strong ties and the solidarity between the parties that are directly or indirectly involved. Whistleblowers may have their personal motives, but they also have a lot to lose. They will need to overcome their fears, accept the consequences of their actions and be ready to face opposition, threats and exclusion. Their decisions are influenced by all sorts of situational factors as well as by emotions, daily experiences and personal contacts. Over the last twenty years, criminological research on whistleblowing has focused on the experiences, motivation and decision-making processes preceding the decision to reveal wrongdoings, {{as well as on the}} impact of the negative consequences and the ineffectiveness of the response to the allegations of whistleblowers. The whistleblowers criminological aspects and the relation between whistleblowing and his importance to prevent and fight the corruption is another issue elaborate in this paper. This research paper also aims to give some advice on how we can overcome challenges and obstacles during the Albanian whistleblower law implementation in practice. Research methodology used in this paper consists on a comparison of several international instruments and reports on whistleblower protection...|$|R
