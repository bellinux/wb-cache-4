6000|$|Yes, my friends, when we say, 'Give us {{this day}} our daily bread,' we do indeed honour God {{and the name}} of God. We declare that He is Love, that He is The Giver, The {{absolutely}} and boundlessly generous and magnanimous Being. And what higher glory and honour or praise can we ascribe, even to God Himself, than to say that of Him? Next, we pray not for ourselves only, but for our neighbours; for England, for Christendom, for the heathen who know not God, and for generations yet unborn. We pray that God would so guide, and teach, and preserve the children of men, as to enable them to fulfil in every country and every age the work which He gave them to do, when He said, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.' We know that our Father has commanded us to labour. We know that our Father has so well ordered this glorious earth, that whosoever labours may reap the just fruit of his labour; therefore we pray that God would prosper our righteous plans for earning our own living. We pray to Him not only so to order the earth that it may bring forth its fruits in due season, but that men may be in a fit state to enjoy those fruits, that God may not be forced for their good to withhold from them blessings which they might abuse to their ruin. But we pray, also, 'Give us:' not me only, but us; and therefore we pray that He would prosper our neighbour's plans as well as ours. So we confess that <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> to be no respecter of persons; we confess that we believe He will not take bread out of others' mouths to give it to us; we declare that God's curse is on all selfishness and oppression of man by man; we renounce our own selfishness, the lust which our fallen nature has to rise upon others' fall, and say, 'Father, we are all children at Thy common table. Thou alone canst prosper the richest and the wisest; Thou alone canst prosper the poorest and the weakest; Thou wilt do equal justice to all some day, and we confess that Thou art just in so doing; we only ask Thee to do it now, and to give us and all mankind that which is good for them.' ...|$|E

Representatives concluded that [...] "in {{light of the}} formation of the new Mennonite Church USA and its departure from Biblical orthodoxy, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> is calling us to form a new affiliation of evangelical Anabaptist congregations." [...] The EAF Board of Directors appointed a committee to make recommendations on how to proceed. Early in 2000, Association of Evangelical Mennonite Congregations was adopted as the tentative name of the organization, and the move toward organization was affirmed. On September 30, 2000, at a meeting in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the first congregation committed to affiliate with the proposed organization.

5000|$|Dummer's wife, Mary, was a {{follower}} of Williams and Anne Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, leading to her and Richard becoming banished to Boston. Soon {{after the birth of}} their son Shubael, Mary became ill and died in February 1636. The Revd. John Eliot said this of her later: She was a Godly woman but by the seduction of her acquaintances she was led away into the new opinions in Mrs Hutchinson's time, and her husband removing to Newbury, she there declared herself and did also with others endeavours, seduce her husband and persuaded him to return to Boston, where she being young with child and ill; Mr. Clarke (one of the same opinions) unskillfully gave her a vomit, which did in such manner torture and torment her with the rising of the mouth, and other violences of nature, that she died in a most uncomfortable manner. But <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> took her away in mercy from worse evil which she was falling into. We doubt not but she is gone to Heaven. Of Dummer, Eliot said [...] "no man more deserved the praise of doing well". Following Mary's death, Dummer, having been disenfranchised with many others as result of his support for Williams and Henry Vane, left the province and returned to Southampton.|$|E
