2500|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone {{was out on}} {{the wing}} of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> stare dumbly before I {{could manage}} to ask: “For Tolosa?” {{in a very}} knowing tone.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be surprised. If the Baron took a like {{cognizance}} {{of all my}} countrymen {{who came}} to New Orleans, he was a busy man indeed.|$|E
60|$|The number drawn to-night was One. On {{examination}} of the Purple Volume, it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> read again.|$|R
60|$|The number drawn {{this evening}} was Three. On the {{production}} of the corresponding manuscript it proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> read again.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Sagramore said: [...] "Well, Sir Knight, {{that was}} certes {{a very great}} buffet that you gave my fellow, but now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> have ado with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{be unable}} to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears, tears of rage, for {{remember}} that I was still very feeble. But Marie spoke for me.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{come to a}} {{standstill}} now. I tried vainly, in the gathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I asked a little impatiently what he meant.|$|E
60|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down, laid Higgs's head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let {{a little}} of the water trickle between his swollen lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{throw in}} this great game. I have heard and {{considered}} all, and I think it best that I should be surrendered, with the Augusta, to the Greeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{times you}} have saved my life, Allan--once at Maraisfontein, once from starvation, and now from Dingaan, whose touch {{would have meant}} my death. I wonder whether it will ever <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> save yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah," [...] quoth Sir Ector, [...] "that {{was a very}} {{wonderful}} buffet you struck my fellow. But now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> have ado with you, and I hope God {{will send}} me a better fortune." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> shiver and become pale, as any may guess who may have chanced to read the history of Mameena, and the turn of Miss Holmes to watch me with {{animated}} interest.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, and so I laughed with her.|$|E
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? And {{where do}} you live?" [...] It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> ask questions, and I popped them out {{as if from a}} Little by Little.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> dictate terms, Alan. You {{know what}} they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work {{yourself}} into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be the best plan," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Now I will go back and take Bertie's place. It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on watch, and he will be wanting to hear the news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Had {{you seen}} Isabel's eye {{when she looked}} on the wild crowd, you would know how little she would heed worse {{persecution}} than my poor aunt could practise. It will soon <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> say you don't deserve her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> smile. He {{was very}} cunning, {{but it was}} evidently this that he was aiming at. He had some reason to conceal {{the fact that he}} had run away with a woman, and he was using every {{precaution}} to hide her whereabouts. I answered with decision.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{face him}} squarely. I did so and {{mentioned}} the amount I could dispose of. And I perceived {{that he was}} disappointed. He thought it over, his calculating gaze lost in mine, {{for quite a long}} time before he came out in a thoughtful tone with the rapacious suggestion: ...|$|E
60|$|My friends’ launch cast us loose {{just below}} the grotto, and then Harris wanted to make out that it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> pull. This seemed to me most unreasonable. It had been {{arranged}} in the morning that I should bring the boat up to three miles above Reading. Well, here we were, ten miles above Reading! Surely it was now their turn again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] I said, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest. I {{have got}} the donkey for nothing; I insist on paying for Dick. They are waiting {{for you in the}} rick-yard. I will settle the terms with Miss Janie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may. Even {{were you}} forcing {{your way into}} the castle I will {{guarantee}} that no hair of their heads shall be injured. And now, prince, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> question. I see Saxon helmets and shields among your followers. Whence come they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you and she {{are both}} safely {{on board the}} DAY DREAM," [...] {{he said to his}} young comrade, [...] "and I feel that Mlle. Suzanne's eyes will not greet me in England with reproachful looks, then it will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> rest." ...|$|R
60|$|The whisky came--and five persons partook. It was fiery, oily {{stuff from}} heaven knows where. The bounder rattled away, {{spouting}} his bits of English and his four words of German. He {{was in high}} feather, wriggling his large haunches on his chair and waving his hands. He had a peculiar manner of wriggling {{from the bottom of}} his back, with fussy self-assertiveness. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> offer whisky.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{stand at}} the foremast-head; and with my {{shoulders}} leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to be}} {{so frightened}} when it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles," [...] said Beth, who was {{toasting}} her face and the bread for tea at the same time.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> indeed <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{surprise}}d, {{and with}} the surprise came glimmering.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrice {{have you}} saved my life, {{and now it}} <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> save yours, for {{there is no other}} path. It may be that they will kill you afterwards, but if so, I shall be glad to have died first in order that I may be ready to greet you in the land beyond.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> now, <b>to</b> {{enlighten}} Ezra Jennings. I stopped him, {{before he}} could say any more.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be {{surprised}} now. I said: [...] "I can't help it. I {{give you my}} word of honor that it is as I say. I saw you at the reception, and you were dressed precisely as you are now. When they told me {{a moment ago that}} I should find a friend in this room, your image rose before me, dress and all, just as I had seen you at the reception." ...|$|E
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> knit my brows. [...] "Was I indeed?" [...] quoth I. [...] "Why, yes, it {{may well}} be. But what of that? Is the hour in which I quitted Pesaro a matter of such moment as to be worth lying over? If I said that I left about the first hour, it is because I was under the {{impression}} that it was so. But I was so distraught by grief at Madonna's death that I may have been careless in my account of time." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> be cheerful, and I {{played the}} {{part to the}} best of my ability, and with such success that I brought the {{laughter}} back into her dear eyes and song on her lips; for she sang to me before she went to an early bed. It was the first time I had heard her sing, and I lay by the fire, listening and transported, for she was nothing if not an artist in everything she did, and her voice, though not strong, was wonderfully sweet and expressive.|$|E
30|$|Peter (a 69  year old, Greek male) {{believes}} that, {{because he}} has not won {{most of the time}} he has gambled on poker machines, the house owes him a win. He is convinced that the odds would dictate that it is about time for him to win. Peter says: “I have lost yesterday, I have lost today, so tomorrow it must <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> win, it must <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> win soon, I can’t lose again can I?” His comment, however, is a typical example of the gambler’s fallacy, disregarding the fact that each spin of a poker machine is an independent occurrence of a new event. His win probability remains the same – a very small one, throughout his playing session. Gambler’s fallacy often represents a metaphor of hope for working class gamblers. Gamblers believe that tough life and a spell of bad luck will eventually be compensated with a spell of good luck and fortune in the future (Ohtsuka & Ohtsuka, 2010).|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> now <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> astonished. Evidently I {{had been}} on the wrong track from the beginning.|$|R
60|$|As her chamberlain {{drew near}} the house, Abu Nowas {{caught sight of}} him. 'There is the Sultana's chamberlain,' he exclaimed in a fright. 'Now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> die. <b>Be</b> quick and spread the sheet over me.' And he laid himself on the bed, and held his breath when the chamberlain came in. 'What are you weeping for?' asked the man, finding the wife in tears.|$|R
