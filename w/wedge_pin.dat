Lightweight structure assembled from tubular struts joined at nodes by wedge pins fitting into mating slots. Joint assembled rapidly by seating <b>wedge</b> <b>pin</b> in V-shaped slots and deforming end of strut until primary pawl engages it...|$|E
40|$|Panels, sheets, {{doors and}} other {{structures}} {{could be easily}} attached to and removed from mating part by proposed new fastener. Fastener is permanently anchored in removable part only. Its protruding end is inserted into a hole in mating part. When <b>wedge</b> <b>pin</b> is screwed tightly closed, segmented collar contracts or expands to release parts or to grip them. Installation has no loose parts, and no rear nut is needed...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 5 {{discusses}} abrasion, {{a common}} wear phenomenon of great economic importance. It {{has been estimated}} that 50 % of the wear encountered in industry is due to abrasion. Also, it is the mechanism involved in the finishing of many surfaces. Experiments are described to help in understanding the complex abrasion process and in predicting friction and wear behavior in plowing and/or cutting. These experimental modelings and measurements used a single spherical pin (asperity) and a single <b>wedge</b> <b>pin</b> (asperity). Other two-body and three-body abrasion studies used hard abrasive particles...|$|E
50|$|The NL {{pontoons}} {{are constructed}} of flotation units of welded steel square boxes, that are assembled like children' wooden block toys which are connected together by special angle iron pieces, called stringers and the flotation boxed and stringers are {{held together by}} special iron <b>wedge</b> <b>pins.</b> The NPL flotation blocks come in two types. The main floating box unit is rectangle-square and is 5 x 5 x 7 ft, the majority of NL pontoon units are constructed using these. The second box {{is similar to the}} first NPL flotation box, only it is curved upward on one side, and these boxes are used to make a bow on the front of an NPL barge when required, similar to a coal or grain barge like you see on rivers.|$|R
50|$|Plug and feather, {{also known}} as plugs and wedges, feather and wedges, <b>wedges</b> and shims, <b>pins</b> and {{feathers}} and feather and tare, refers to a technique and a three-piece tool set used to split stone.|$|R
50|$|The word bolt {{is also a}} {{very old}} word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the {{substrate}} to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, <b>pinning,</b> <b>wedging,</b> etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called screw bolts in contradistinction to clench bolts.|$|R
50|$|The axe haft is {{sometimes}} called the handle. Traditionally, {{it was made of}} a resilient hardwood like hickory or ash, but modern axes often have hafts made of durable synthetic materials. Antique axes and their modern reproductions, like the tomahawk, often had a simple, straight haft with a circular cross-section that wedged onto the axe-head without the aid of <b>wedges</b> or <b>pins.</b> Modern hafts are curved for better grip and to aid in the swinging motion, and are mounted securely to the head. The shoulder is where the head mounts onto the haft, and this is either a long oval or rectangular cross-section of the haft that is secured to the axe head with small metal or wooden wedges. The belly of the haft is the longest part, where it bows in gently, and the throat is where it curves sharply down to the short grip, just {{before the end of the}} haft, which is known as the knob.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} forms of {{fastening}} in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and <b>pins,</b> <b>wedging,</b> mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and [...] "clinch bolts" [...] (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.|$|R
40|$|Unilateral medial patellar {{luxation}} {{was diagnosed}} in 10, and bilateral medial patellar luxation in six, large and giant-breed dogs (22 stifles). Lameness occurred in five dogs after trauma or surgery, and 11 dogs had no known predisposing history. The mean age at presentation was 25 months, {{and the mean}} time from initial onset of clinical signs to diagnosis was 13 weeks. All traumatic or iatrogenic luxations (five dogs) were unilateral. Luxations presumed to be congenital were unilateral in five dogs and bilateral in six. The grades of medial patellar luxation were I (1 stifle), II (11 stifles), III (9 stifles), and IV (1 stifle). Preoperative function was good (1 dog), fair (9 dogs), and poor (6 dogs). Surgical correction was performed in dogs with grades II, III, and IV luxations (21 stifles). Complications included one wound dehiscence and trochlear <b>wedge</b> migration, one <b>pin</b> loosening, and one persistent lameness caused by lymphoplasmacytic synovitis. Long-term follow-up was available in 13 dogs (18 stifles). Function was judged by owners to be excellent in seven dogs, good in five dogs, and poor in one dog. Surgical treatment of grades II and III luxations yielded good (8 stifles) and excellent (9 stifles) results, while one grade IV luxation had a poor long-term outcome.

40|$|Nanoimprinting with {{anodized}} aluminum membranes {{was performed}} to produce nanoposts with controlled diameter and aspect ratio. The polymer nanoposts were found to remain upright and preserve the post-packing structure at low aspect ratios, but succumbed to elastocapillary coalescence at higher aspect ratios, with the morphology of the aggregates {{directly related to the}} aspect ratio of the polymer nanoposts. Replication of the replicated nanoposts at low aspect ratio was achieved to reproduce the pore packing structure of the original alumina membrane. ^ Teflon microparticles were found to be effective stabilizers for inverse foams, producing dry water with excellent flow properties and contact stability and consisting of non-spherical liquid marbles 90 - 500 microns in diameter. The chemical inertness of the PTFE particles allowed for use of not only water, but also aqueous solutions of acids and bases and organic molecules including ionic liquids and water-soluble polymers. The teflon particle shell stabilized the liquid drop such that two particles containing two solutions which would ordinarily mix and/or react would remain separate. ^ The wettability studies focused on demonstrating that entrapped gases are not responsible for Cassie superhydrophobic wetting behavior, that the removal of the pockets of air would not lead to Wenzel wetting behavior with an increase in contact angle hysteresis. The measurement of advancing and receding contact angles on surfaces with controlled topography consisting of square posts holes showed that the contact angles remained unchanged despite removal of over 90 % of the air. It showed that water was not intruding into the hydrophobic topography because the Laplace pressure was thermodynamically preventing water from increasing its interaction with the topographically-patterned surface. Wettability studies were also aimed at extending our understanding of wettability as a one-dimensional phenomenon from the three-phase contact line perspective, by investigating the ability of hydrophilic arcs, short and long wedges, and the outlines of the <b>wedges,</b> to <b>pin</b> water drops on hydrophobic, low hysteresis surfaces. They were additionally aimed at studying the ability of hydrophilic lines to deform the three-phase contact line of a water drop and kinetically trap a water drop in a distorted shape on a hydrophobic surface. ...|$|R
40|$|Dublin 2 ̆ 7 s nineteenth-century Tobacco Store {{built by}} John Rennie(1761 - 1821) is {{considered}} significant {{due to its}} cast-and wrought-iron roof trusses. Though {{by no means the}} first to experiment with iron, Rennie had been a firm believer in the superiority of this material over timber in warehouse construction and used it extensively throughout his portfolio. Less acknowledged is that a similar, yet more advanced truss was used in the New West Stores (demolished 1988), also built as part of the Dublin Docks ensemble by Rennie. That this achievement was overlooked was a result of the roof structure being replaced with a less adventurous timber roof following its collapse in afire in 1833, ten years after its completion. Archival evidence suggests that the original cast-and wrought-iron truss designed by Rennie for the New West Stores mirrored that of the earlier Tobacco Store in profile consisting of queen-post truss, surmounted by a lantern structure and a smaller kingpost truss. However, this later truss far exceeded the earlier structure in span, being 52 foot 6 inches in comparison to the 38 foot 9 inch span of the Tobacco Store. As studies in the evolution of iron truss technology have suggested that the span of early trusses were limited to 40 feet, which was not exceeded until after the 1830 swhen such inventions as the Polonceau truss and various arched truss technologies were introduced, this early truss by Rennie was a significant achievement in the 1820 s. In addition to its span, it is probable that this truss also represented an evolution in Rennie 2 ̆ 7 s connection details. Prior to his work in Dublin Rennie had favoured connections made with slotted assemblies, using <b>wedges</b> and cotter <b>pins</b> to tighten and hold pieces together, which were of-ten dependent on the structure 2 ̆ 7 s own self weight to provide stability –a strategy employed in the London Tobacco Dock, the West India Dock sheds and even the Southwark Bridge. The truss work in the Dublin Tobacco Store mirrored this tendency, until the connections were re-worked during a recent renovation. Evidence from Rennie 2 ̆ 7 s resident engineer John Aird (1760 - 1832) and later work by his sons at the Royal William Victualing Yard, suggest that the connections used in the New West Stores truss may have represented an evolution in this thinking, with the introduction of bolted connections to the assembly...|$|R
