Afterward, members of Sheela's team spread Salmonella on produce in grocery stores and on doorknobs and urinal handles in the county courthouse, but this did not produce the desired effects. In September and October 1984, they contaminated the salad bars of 10 local restaurants with Salmonella, infecting 751people. Forty-five people received hospital treatment; all survived.|$|E

In this study, data recorded <b>with</b> <b>glass</b> microelectrodes or antimony electrodes, both with external cutaneous Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, connected to two different recording devices are compared. Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH less than 4) ranged from poor to excellent (0. 55 to 1. 00). Differences in data recorded <b>with</b> <b>glass</b> electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r: 0. 93 to 1. 00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0. 90). Correlation between data recorded <b>with</b> <b>glass</b> and antimony probes is rather poor (0. 55 to 0. 70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded <b>with</b> <b>glass</b> electrodes.

25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility <b>with</b> <b>glasses.</b> Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than <b>with</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E

25|$|Giorgio de Chirico, and his {{previous}} development of metaphysical art, {{was one of}} the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. The Red Tower (La tour rouge) from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du poète) has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust <b>with</b> <b>glasses</b> and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel Hebdomeros presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the Ballets Russes, would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dalí and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Peel's {{view was}} contested by Anderson's and Cull's {{belief that the}} series, with its bespectacled main {{character}} of Joe McClaine, can increase the self-confidence of young viewers who wear glasses: [...] "Suddenly they were proud because they had {{something in common with}} Joe 90." [...] Since the series' first appearance, the epithet [...] "Joe 90" [...] has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults <b>with</b> <b>glasses</b> reminiscent of Joe's (such as snooker player Dennis Taylor). During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for wearing large spectacles. Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, [...] "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent." ...|$|E

At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through". She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended mass.|$|E

She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the public address system and [...] "missing person" [...] posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as [...] "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man <b>with</b> <b>glasses,</b> but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street.

500|$|La Rivière {{noted the}} {{intimacy}} of the series and the predominantly male voice cast and characters, suggesting that Joe 90 is [...] "very much a Boy's Own adventure." [...] Out of the 30 episodes, only ten feature appearances from female characters, a fact which La Rivière attributes to the increased demands on Century 21 for its feature film productions, Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger. Peel suggests that the female absence leaves Joe 90, with many other Anderson productions, inferior to previous Supermarionation effort Thunderbirds, in which the character of Lady Penelope has a primary role in several episodes. Grouping Joe 90 with the earlier Supercar and the subsequent The Secret Service, Peel concludes, [...] "It is hardly coincidental that these {{tend to be the}} least-loved of [...] series; he had, after all, ignored half of his potential audience." [...] For Peel, this return of the [...] "standard Anderson sexism" [...] is only one aspect of deterioration between Joe 90 and previous productions. Peel challenges La Rivière's asserted [...] "kids play Bond" [...] theme, writing that, [...] "being a somewhat nerdy kid <b>with</b> <b>glasses</b> and brain implants was not really thrilling." ...|$|E

As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills {{on her face and}} neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings [...] "You and I" [...] in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.|$|E
