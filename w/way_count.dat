"You will {{wonder why}} I am {{speaking}} thus to you, Colonel Campbell, {{but it is}} of the greatest necessity that her majesty should know upon whom she can rely absolutely in case of trouble. You, sir, being altogether unconnected {{with any of the}} great families of France, stand in a different position from that of the great majority of officers of your rank. Look where I will, I see our regiments officered by men connected by birth and family with one or other of the men who are at present intriguing against us, and were they ordered to take steps to arrest, for example, one of those persons connected with them, they might, without openly refusing, give such warning to them that {{they would be able to}} escape. Now, sir, I ask you to tell me frankly whether, under all contingencies, the queen can rely upon your services? I give you my word that whatever your reply is, it shall in no <b>way</b> <b>count</b> against you. There are cases in which it would doubtless be painful to you to carry out such an order. You are a protege of Monsieur de Turenne. Monsieur de Turenne is brother of the Duc de Bouillon, and, as I know, you yourself were staying for some months in the castle of Sedan, where you went to be cured of your wounds. Now, monsieur, frankly, were you ordered to arrest the Duc de Bouillon, would you carry it out without fear or favour?" ...|$|E

[...] I had interrupted her by the movement with which again, uncontrollably tossed on one of my surges of certitude, I turned away. How deep they must have been in together for her to have so at last gathered herself up, and in how doubly interesting a light, above all, it seemed to present Long for the future! That was, while I warned myself, what I most read in--literally an implication of the enhancement of this latter side of the prodigy. If his cleverness, under the alarm that, first stirring their consciousness but dimly, had so swiftly developed as to make next of each a mirror for the other, and then to precipitate for them, in some silence deeper than darkness, the exchange of recognitions, admissions and, as they certainly would have phrased it, tips--if his excited acuteness was henceforth to protect itself by dissimulation, what wouldn't perhaps, for one's diversion, be the new spectacle and wonder? I could in a manner already measure this larger play by the amplitude freshly determined in Mrs. Briss, and I was for a moment actually held by the thought of the possible finish our friend would find it in him to give to a represented, a fictive ineptitude. The sharpest jostle to my thought, in this rush, might well have been, I confess, the reflection that as it was I who had arrested, who had spoiled their unconsciousness, so it was natural they should fight against me for a possible life in the state I had given them instead. I had spoiled their unconsciousness, I had destroyed it, and it was consciousness alone that could make them effectively cruel. Therefore, if they were cruel, it was I who had determined it, inasmuch as, consciously, they could only want, they could only intend, to live. Wouldn't that question have been, I managed even now to ask myself, the very basis on which they had inscrutably come together? [...] "It's life, you know," [...] each had said to the other, [...] "and I, accordingly, can only cling to mine. But you, poor dear--shall you give up?" [...] "Give up?"

30|$|The {{experiments}} involved {{preparation of}} a 100 -μL radioactive sample in a 10 -mm (inner) diameter glass test tube. Activity {{at the start}} of the experiment was less than 18 kBq in order to minimize detector deadtime. The sample was initially counted for 150 s to establish a low-noise reference count rate. Forty additional 30 -s counting measurements were then performed. Between each measurement, 100 μL of non-radioactive water was added to the test tube so as to progressively increase the sample volume, while maintaining the total activity unchanged (not withstanding radioactive decay that was corrected analytically). In this <b>way,</b> <b>count</b> rate data were obtained for sample volumes between 0.1 and 4.0 mL. Each measurement was divided by the initial 150 -s reference measurement in order to estimate the relative efficiency with respect to a 100 -μL sample. All experiments were repeated twice on different days using separate sample preparations.|$|E
