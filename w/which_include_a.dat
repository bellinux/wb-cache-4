5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> fierce independence and a disregard for social mores. Modern literary critics {{have noted that}} the relationship between the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E
5|$|Since Wagner's death, the Bayreuth Festival, {{which has}} become an annual event, has been {{successively}} directed by his widow, his son Siegfried, the latter's widow Winifred Wagner, their two sons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, and, presently, two of the composer's great-granddaughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the village {{can be traced to}} the stream which runs through the parish and gave rise to a number of corn mills along its length. The {{earliest}} recorded mention of the village is in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village contains a number of listed buildings, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> 12th-century church, an old mill house and two oast houses.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological and toponymic {{evidence}} of Wormshill's existence predates its {{appearance in the}} Domesday survey of 1086. The village contains a number of heritage-listed buildings, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> Norman church, a public house {{and one of the}} oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom. The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed little in the past 500years, and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average. The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the bridge}} is Bodiam railway station, the western {{terminus}} of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000. On the north {{bank of the river}} is Bodiam Castle, built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge. Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later. The buildings are grade I listed, and the landscaped grounds, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> millpond and a Second World War pillbox, are a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of crustaceans are aquatic and the isopods {{are one of}} the few groups of which some members now live on land. The only other crustaceans <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> small number of terrestrial species are amphipods (like sandhoppers) and decapods (crabs, shrimp, etc.). Terrestrial isopods play an important role in many tropical and temperate ecosystems by aiding in the decomposition of plant material through mechanical and chemical means, and by enhancing the activity of microbes. Macro-detritivores, including terrestrial isopods, are absent from arctic and sub-arctic regions, but have the potential to expand their range with increased temperatures in high latitudes.|$|E

On the wall of the southwest crossing pier are monuments <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> cenotaph to the casualties in HMSChester in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 who included the 16-year-old John Cornwell VC. The west wall of the south transept has many memorials, including cenotaphs to the Cheshire Regiment, the Royal Air Force and the Free Czech Forces.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, several {{redevelopment}} {{projects in the}} downtown area, some {{of which had been}} discussed for decades, were put into motion and resulted in nearly $110 million in total investment from public and private sources. The first of these was the Phoenix Project, a development privately financed by Kent resident Ron Burbick that renovated and expanded a section of commercial space along East Main Street. Included in the project was construction of a pedestrian alleyway lined with small shops, eventually known as Acorn Alley, which opened in 2009. A second phase of Acorn Alley opened the next year. Other aspects of the redevelopment, <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> 360-space parking deck and bus transfer station, a hotel and conference center, and three separate mixed-use buildings, began to take shape in 2010 following the demolition of several buildings in a four block area. New offices for Ametek and the Davey Tree Expert Company opened in late 2012 along with several new small businesses on the first floors of each building. The hotel, operated by Kent State University, opened in June 2013 and the new parking garage, operated by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) opened April 30, 2013, as the Kent Central Gateway. In addition to parking, the facility functions as PARTA's main bus transfer station and has storefronts on the ground level facing East Erie Street. Included in the redevelopment was the purchase and renovation of the old Kent hotel, which first opened in 1920. After being mostly vacant since 1979 and completely vacant since 2000, it re-opened on April 1, 2013, as the new home to the Kent location of Buffalo Wild Wings and also houses offices, a wine and jazz bar, and apartments. A five-story mixed-use building called The Landmark was completed in 2014 and construction started in November 2015 on an additional five-story mixed-use building featuring microapartments, scheduled to be completed in 2016. The developments attracted the attention of The Plain Dealer and The New York Times and earned the city and university the 2013 Larry Abernathy Award from the International Town–Gown Association in recognition of the positive town–gown cooperation and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a small}} port at Minehead by 1380, but it was {{not until}} 1420 that money given by Lady Margaret Luttrell enabled {{improvements}} to be made and a jetty built. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the town had its own Port Officer similar to the position at Bristol. Vessels in the 15th century included the Trinite which traded between Ireland and Bristol, and others carrying salt and other cargo from La Rochelle in France. Other products included local wool and cloth which were traded for coal from South Wales. In 1559 a Charter of Incorporation, established a free Borough and Parliamentary representation, but was made conditional on improvements being made to the port. The harbour silted up and fell into disrepair so that in 1604 James I withdrew the town's charter. Control reverted to the Luttrells and a new harbour was built, at a cost of £5,000, further out to sea than the original, which had been at the mouth of the Bratton Stream. It incorporated a pier, dating from 1616, and was built to replace that at Dunster which was silting up. Trade was primarily with Wales for cattle, sheep, wool, butter, fish and coal. These are commemorated in the town arms <b>which</b> <b>include</b> <b>a</b> woolpack and sailing ship. Privateers based at Minehead were involved in the war with Spain and France during 1625–1630 and again during the War of the Spanish Succession from 1702–1713. The first cranes were installed after further improvements to the port in 1714.|$|E
