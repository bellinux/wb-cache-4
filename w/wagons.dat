5|$|Calthrop {{constructed}} {{the line for}} £35,944, £11,000 less than the original estimate. He had Kitson & Co construct two 2-6-4T locomotives, similar in outline but smaller than the Barsi Light Railway locomotives. Goods rolling stock included four coaches, two bogie open <b>wagons</b> and one bogie van, once again similar to Barsi stock. He also introduced four transporter <b>wagons,</b> designed to transport standard-gauge <b>wagons.</b> Each station on route had a short section of standard-gauge track where the <b>wagons</b> could be placed. The use of transporter <b>wagons</b> eliminated transshipment, and removed the need for large numbers of goods <b>wagons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early <b>wagons</b> {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early <b>wagons</b> were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel <b>wagons.</b> Groups of <b>wagons</b> {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Woodham’s {{began taking}} <b>wagons</b> and {{locomotives}} for scrap, and stored {{increasing numbers of}} <b>wagons</b> and locomotives on low-level sidings beside the oil terminal and on new sidings built on reclaimed land where the West Pond had been filled in.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 <b>wagons,</b> after only 16 years in operation, and ten of the <b>wagons</b> were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining <b>wagons</b> will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million {{to keep them in}} operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the <b>wagons</b> for 22 million NOK each year, even though they were not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1831, some <b>wagons</b> {{ran away}} on an {{inclined}} plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at Avenhambrow. The brakesman jumped off but was run over {{and killed by}} <b>wagons</b> being drawn up the incline on an adjacent line.|$|E
5|$|Rollingstock in Victoria {{has used}} air braking since tests of {{continuous}} train brakes {{were carried out}} in 1884. Initially screw couplings were used to connect <b>wagons,</b> but from 1924 automatic knuckle couplers were introduced, with buffers removed from freight <b>wagons</b> by 1960.|$|E

5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open <b>wagons</b> {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie <b>wagons</b> replaced them. In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open <b>wagons,</b> 400 tank cars, and 300 flat <b>wagons.</b> Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat <b>wagons,</b> and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E
5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} <b>wagons</b> and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods <b>wagons</b> to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods <b>wagons</b> were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted <b>wagons</b> (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Woodham’s {{concentrated}} on scrapping the <b>wagons,</b> since locomotives were harder to cut up, {{and expected to}} start on the locomotives when the supply of <b>wagons</b> dried up.|$|E

5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke particularly on the proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter <b>wagons.</b> Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer <b>wagons,</b> based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel <b>wagons</b> and other provisions.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply <b>wagons</b> in a defensible area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a defensive firing line at the gap between the <b>wagons</b> they had just entered.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot {{was located}} nearby, with Shirehampton station {{handling}} the goods traffic, {{with up to}} 60 <b>wagons</b> per day inbound, mostly containing hay and sawdust for the horses. Twelve <b>wagons</b> of manure were dispatched each day, some to Cadbury Road on the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway.|$|E

Ideally, the wedges are driven under the <b>wagon</b> {{to the extent that}} the <b>wagon</b> is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters.

5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods <b>wagons</b> to any scheduled passenger services.

50|$|The Yorkshire Patent Steam <b>Wagon</b> Co. was a steam <b>wagon</b> {{manufacturer}} in Leeds, England. They produced their first <b>wagon</b> in 1901.

5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of <b>wagons</b> rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The <b>wagons</b> held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the <b>wagons.</b> The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the <b>wagons</b> in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E

For 1957, the Del Rio Ranch <b>Wagon</b> was introduced (replacing both the Custom Ranch <b>Wagon</b> and the Parklane), sporting special ranch-pattern upholstery. That same model {{was the basis for}} the new 1957 Ranchero, and a Mercury version called the Mercury Commuter which was a hardtop inspired <b>wagon</b> without a [...] "B" [...] pillar.|$|R
