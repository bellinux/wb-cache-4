25|$|The Domesday survey {{therefore}} {{recorded the}} names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king's instructions, it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the annual value of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of Edward the Confessor's death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) {{at the time of the}} survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and it is probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of Domesday Book is devoted to the somewhat arid details of the assessment and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the manor, the record sets forth the amount of arable land, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for working it, with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, <b>woodland,</b> <b>pasture,</b> fisheries (i.e. fishing weirs), water-mills, salt-pans (if by the sea) and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the annual value of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.|$|E

[...] Strong {{financial}} support was offered to the MB by local businesses, who were unhappy {{with the idea of}} the M building their own railway. [...] The Manchester and Leeds District Board of Trade produced a report in 1845 which gave their backing to the M and the line was sanctioned in 1846, however the MB project was unaffected by this connection.|$|E

Edward had not yet improved Windsor Castle, so used Berkhamsted as his main property, investing considerable sums in renovating it. His son, Edward, the Black Prince, was created Duke of Cornwall and also made extensive use of the castle, which formed {{part of the new}} duchy. The Black Prince took advantage of the aftermath of the Black Death to extend the castle's park by , including some <b>woodland</b> <b>pasture</b> stretching over the Chilterns, eventually producing a park covering [...] The castle was used to hold John II of France after he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Poitiers.

60|$|Monument Mountain, to the southward, {{was still}} in the centre of the scene, but seemed to have sunk and subsided, so that it was now but an undistinguished member of a large family of hills. Beyond it, the Taconic range looked higher and bulkier than before. Our pretty lake was seen, with all its little bays and inlets; and not that alone, but two or three new lakes were opening their blue eyes to the sun. Several white villages, each with its steeple, were {{scattered}} about in the distance. There were so many farm-houses, with their acres of <b>woodland,</b> <b>pasture,</b> mowing-fields, and tillage, that the children could hardly make room in their minds to receive all these different objects. There, too, was Tanglewood, which they had hitherto thought such an important apex of the world.

60|$|The day {{following}} the great stagecoach robbery found the patient proprietor of Collinson's Mill calm and untroubled {{in his usual}} seclusion. The news that had thrilled the length and breadth of Galloper's Ridge had not touched the leafy banks of the dried-up river; the hue and cry had followed the stage-road, and no courier had deemed it worth his while to diverge {{as far as the}} rocky ridge which formed the only pathway to the mill. That day Collinson's solitude had been unbroken even by the haggard emigrant from the valley, with his old monotonous story of hardship and privation. The birds had flown nearer to the old mill, as if emboldened by the unwonted quiet. That morning there had been the half human imprint of a bear's foot in the ooze beside the mill-wheel; and coming home with his scant stock from the <b>woodland</b> <b>pasture,</b> he had found a golden squirrel--a beautiful, airy embodiment of the brown woods itself--calmly seated on his bar-counter, with a biscuit between its baby hands. He was full of his characteristic reveries and abstractions that afternoon; falling into them even at his wood-pile, leaning on his axe--so still that an emerald-throated lizard, who had slid upon the log, went to sleep under the forgotten stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Agriculture {{remained}} by far {{the most}} important part of the English economy during the 12th and 13th centuries. There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas were grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead. In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures,</b> whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket making and peat cutting.|$|R

40|$|Use of cattle-grazed and ungrazed <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures</b> by {{red deer}} Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 and wild boar Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758 was {{investigated}} monthly by measuring dung-deposition rates. Cattle Bos taurus grazed pastures year-round, with peak intensities {{during the growing}} season (May¿September). Red deer and wild boar grazed pastures primarily during autumn and winter (October-April) when cattle occupancy was at a minimum. The lower occupancy of cattle in pastures from November to April was interpreted as the result of competition with red deer. Mean sward height in this period fell below 6. 5 cm. In autumn and winter a negative relationship was found for red deer and wild boar occupancy with sward height, which indicated that red deer and wild boar preferred swards previously grazed by cattle. At the start of the growing season, when cattle occupancy in the pastures increased, red deer switched their habitat preference and almost totally disappeared from pastures to use alternative feeding grounds. Interpretation of the results lead to the conclusion that facilitative and competitive interactions occurred between sympatric cattle and red deer in <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures,</b> and to some extent also between cattle and wild boar...|$|R

A {{graduate}} of the State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, with a PhD. in Forestry and Botany from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Kimmerer has studied trees and woodland for over forty years, the last thirty-two of which have been in the Kentucky Bluegrass. He has taught classes in forestry, urban forestry, and tree and plant physiology in the U. S., Indonesia, and Malaysia. Venerable Trees is his first book and he expects to publish his second, The Lives of Trees later this year. Kimmerer continues to research tree physiology, plant stress, and plant/animal interactions, and is also an avid photographer. TVenerable Trees, Inc. is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit corporation in Lexington, KY that seeks to protect and preserve <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Kentucky Bluegrass region. This conservation specifically targets ancient trees and <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures</b> that often pre-date settlement in Kentucky, yet are deteriorating due to age, negligence, and even mismanagement and demolition. In addition to research and publication about these ecosystems, the non-profit also tasks itself with public education and outreach, consultation services for property owners and developers to maximize the lifespans of these trees or encourage replacement, and growing new trees of the same species through partnering nurseries. Venerable Trees: History, Biology, and Conservation in the Bluegrass highlights the history, biology, and beauty of select trees and <b>woodland</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Bluegrass region that age between 300 and 500 years old. It follows the history of development in Kentucky and biology of trees in the Bluegrass that explains their continued existence today. Kimmerer also stresses the contemporary threats, such as natural disaster or human development, and conservation efforts and innovative ideas to protect the regional environment. The book also includes Kimmerer’s beautiful photography of these ancient trees and woodlands...|$|R
