25|$|During {{the early}} stages of its development, Alpha Protocol had no {{personnel}} assigned to the lead roles on the project. However, the development team did not have much direction for the game, and they did not know which target audience the game <b>will</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to.</b> To make the matter worse, the team did not prepare any documents laying out a specific set of guidelines for how the game will be designed and developed. The team was also struggling with designing stealth for the game {{due to the lack of}} experiences and technical difficulties caused by the Unreal Engine 3. At that time, Obsidian was working on another project for Sega named Aliens: Crucible. Sega eventually decided to cancel Aliens: Crucible and this prompted the Alpha Protocol team to realize that the game's slow progress and development cannot persist any further. At around the two year mark, Obsidian co-owner Chris Parker joined the game as the project director, and the studio's creative director Chris Avellone volunteered to become its lead designer due to the absence of one.|$|E

It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, as far as they could, to tradition, and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system."

500|$|The {{game was}} also {{featured}} in UK-based magazine Mean Machines in May1991.

He also criticized the fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid-air. However, he noted the game's good gameplay. Julian Rignall also said that the game was fun, but it was not spectacular. However, just as Regan noted, Rignall said that the game did not offer anything special like with better titles such as Mega Man2 or Super Mario Bros.2. However, he noted the game's good graphics and challenge, though both noted that the backgrounds [...] "are slightly bland". Both reviewers said the game was well-presented with good introductions and a password mode, easy controls, fair challenge, and [...] "fairly good tunes and effects which fit the action well". Overall, they said that Ironsword was [...] "a fun but ultimately limited game that <b>will</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> platform fans".|$|E

The reviewer said that a promising story [...] "whips itself up into a virtually incomprehensible final act". Science fiction critic John Clute described the book as [...] "cosmological [...] without a net", and complained that Bear rushes through the story too quickly and does not dwell long enough on locations like the Kalpa to make it memorable.

Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised 'Blank Page' and 'Sing for Me', writing that [...] "they are minimal piano ballads on which Aguilera discusses working through regret and reclaiming her sense of self, respectively. The spare music lets her still-powerful voice dominate, and her impassioned delivery conveys how meaningful these songs are to her." [...] Sarah Godfrey of Washington Post commented that the song [...] "is about hackneyed metaphors and big notes — {{just the sort of}} combination that <b>will</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> fans of Aguilera's signature song 'Beautiful. Idolator critic Mike Wass complimented Aguilera's ability to [...] "tone it down" [...] on the song, but he was surprised at the level of simplicity considering Furler's [...] "alternative leanings".

500|$|Klepacki's solo work {{debuted in}} 2002 with Morphscape. Production began in 1996 {{with the song}} Cybertek, though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of Morphscapes songs were {{composed}} after Red Alert 2. Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on Command & Conquer: Renegade, and feels the game's style is visibly present in Morphscape. Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in Command & Conquer. Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, {{the first of which}} is entitled Rocktronic. Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that <b>will</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> Command & Conquer fans. Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release; the title [...] "Rocktronic" [...] was an attempt to name his style of music. Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller. Following Rocktronic was Virtual Control, released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in The Ultimate Fighter, along with certain custom themes written for the show.|$|E
