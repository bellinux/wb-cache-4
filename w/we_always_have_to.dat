[...] After a year out on strike, in March 1985 the NUM leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £1.5billion, and the strike was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar.

5000|$|Throughout {{this episode}} the blockade's elder statesman, Rayno Fisher, {{encouraged}} {{those in the}} protest camp to heed his interpretation. This experienced trapper extorted. [...] "We're not trespassing the CNR, the CNR has been trespassing us for 75 years." [...] Elder Frances Abraham also provided inspirational leadership throughout ten-day blockade. When Indian OPP officials arrived on the reserve to read out in the Anishinaabe language an injunction obtained by the CNR, Abraham emplored, [...] "Why do <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show the proof that our land has been taken but those who stole our land never have to prove anything." [...] No charges pressed by the Crown against the protesters suggests the veracity of Mr. Fisher's characterization. Long Lake 58's blockade of the CNR main line was backed up by simultaneous blockades of the Canadian Pacific Railway's main line led by members of Ojibways of the Pic River First Nation, Pic Mobert First Nation, and Pays Plat First Nation further to the south. Of all the actions during the Indian summer of 1990 the train blockades initiated by Long Lake 58 in northern Ontario impacted most seriously on transnational flows of commerce.|$|E
5000|$|During this period, Sabean {{followed}} {{a strategy of}} avoiding high draft picks, telling the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Quite frankly, we're very reluctant to overspend in the draft. We're cautious in that regard because it's so fallible. Our focus is spending {{as much as we}} can and being as wise as we can at the major-league level and using the minor leagues as a supplement and not necessarily leaning on it totally. Teams that are allowed to have a three-to- five-year plan and allowed to lose or explain to their fans they're in a rebuilding mode have a greater latitude than we do. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in a reloading mode". [...] The Giants ranked 22nd in baseball on money spent in the draft and internationally between 2000 and 2004. [...] On several occasions, Sabean's signing of veteran players before the arbitration deadline cost the team future draft picks. In 2004, Sabean forfeited the team's number one pick to sign Michael Tucker. [...] In 2005, the Giants didn't pick until the fourth round after surrendering their first three selections to sign Benítez, Mike Matheny, and Omar Vizquel. The Giants did draft and sign first-round pitcher Tim Lincecum in the 2006 draft. Among early draft picks the Giants have used in Sabean's tenure, the majority were used on pitching talent (also see: Jesse Foppert, Kurt Ainsworth, Jerome Williams, Matt Cain, and Noah Lowry).|$|E

Having entered South Carolina, he recorded in his 1872 book, Afoot & Alone, that he spent the night [...] "with a young man, whose family were away, leaving him all alone in a great mansion. He had been a cavalry sergeant, wore his hat on the side of his head, and had an exceedingly confidential manner."

5000|$|I just didn't {{want us to}} be the Lady Bulldogs. I {{could hear}} people saying, [...] "There comes Coach Hogg and all of her little b!+¢#ə$." [...] Former head coach Sonja Hogg on the Lady Techsters {{nickname}} in 2009 In 1974, Louisiana Tech President F. Jay Taylor established the university's first women's athletic program, a women's basketball team. He hired a 28-year-old P.E. teacher at Ruston High School, Sonja Hogg, as the program's first head coach. However, Hogg refused to call her team the Lady Bulldogs after the La Tech men's nickname. She asserted that bulldogs were [...] "unfeminine" [...] and that [...] "a lady dog is a b!+¢#." [...] For that reason, her first initiative as head coach was to nix the nickname Bulldogs from any connection with her team. Thus, Hogg decided to change her team's nickname to the Lady Techsters. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look like ladies. Point guard Kim Mulkey on being a Lady Techster in 1983 Hogg would not allow her Lady Techsters to wear knee or elbow pads because they were unladylike. Additionally, she designed the Lady Techster jerseys with sleeves because she did not like her ladies showing their armpits or bra straps. By requiring her players to be ladylike, Hogg created an [...] "almost antebellum image" [...] of the Lady Techsters. A 1986 Sports Illustrated article stated, [...] "A Lady Techster {{is likely to be a}} good student and a devout Christian, probably favors needlepoint over Madonna tapes on airplanes and fears a drug test about as much as she does an airport metal detector." ...|$|E
5000|$|Looking back on {{this version}} of the band, Grant Nicholas {{explained}} in an interview with Culture Deluxe, [...] "We {{were going to do it}} so underground, just turning up at venues and not even saying who we were, just doing gigs like any other band do and like we did when we first started. But we felt that by just road testing the new album some of the real diehard fans might feel a little bit left out so we kind of hinted that we were doing this thing but we didn’t say exactly what it was. Some of them got it straight away, [...] "I’m sure they’re just doing this…" [...] but some of them thought we’d split up or it was a new name or I’d done a solo record or whatever but it got people talking and excited and that was kind of the point as well. We didn’t sit down and work out this massive, amazing marketing plan, it wasn’t that calculated but it was just a way of us going back to doing some very small shows away from the usual Feeder thing and not having to play all the usual songs <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play. Not that we hate them, it’s just nice to do something different sometimes and be able to play a whole album live, which we haven’t done since our first album. The more albums you do and the more singles you have, that steadily becomes your set and it’s very difficult to get away from that because people go [...] "oh I went to see so and so play and they didn’t play any of the fucking singles", you know it happens and people get pissed off about it so that would be the point. It was a bit confusing as there were some gigs where the promoters put Feeder on the bloody tickets so some more mainstream fans turned up and were like [...] "what the fuck’s this?" [...] you know, [...] "where’s [...] "Buck Rogers"?" [...] but that was bound to happen, you can’t keep everyone happy. But we had a great time doing it, it was such good fun".|$|E
