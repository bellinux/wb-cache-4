5|$|The Georgia Tech administration's {{position}} on stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has varied over the years. When the 'T' was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President Vernon Crawford <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> he considered canceling classes {{until it was}} returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to {{turn a blind eye}} to the practice, with one president, John Patrick Crecine, going so far as to endorse it.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason why}} the Kurds <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> over {{pictures}} showing Saddam Hussein was because of Hussein massacres of Kurds.|$|R

25|$|Later, Sarah {{gave birth}} to Isaac, and {{the tension between the}} women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by it that she demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She {{declared}} that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.|$|E
25|$|The {{new king}} of Sweden, Athislus (Eadgils), {{thought that the}} tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king's mother and so took Urse for a queen. However, after some time, Urse <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> with the Swedish king's greed that she thought out a ruse {{to run away from}} the king {{and at the same time}} {{liberate}} him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to support the}} invasion was not unanimous. It was opposed by Karl Radek and was held secret from Trotsky {{who was in the}} Ural area at that time. The latter <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the news of the Central Committee decision and Ordzhonikidze’s role in engineering it that on his return to Moscow he demanded, though fruitlessly, that a special party commission be set up to investigate the affair. Later Trotsky would reconcile himself to the accomplished fact and even defend the invasion in a special pamphlet.|$|E

25|$|The episode {{scheduled}} for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes late {{due to an}} XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing on a delay. Michaels <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the delay that the episode was rerun a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.|$|E
25|$|The Bolsheviks {{started a}} new workers-oriented {{newspaper}} in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it Pravda. Trotsky <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> {{by what he saw}} as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Alexander was preparing to crown his second wife as tsarina-consort, much as Peter the Great had done with his wife Marta Helena Skowrońska, who became Catherine I. Indeed, the tsar ordered research {{be done on the}} subject in order to evaluate how Catherine's coronation might be achieved. The tsarevich <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by these plans that he threatened to leave for Denmark with his family, but he chose to stay after the tsar threatened to replace him as heir by his half-brother. Another rumour suggested the tsar might abdicate, at the urging of his wife, and go to live with her and their children in France.|$|E

25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|He {{then joined}} Rangers for £65,000, then a record fee for a {{transfer}} between two Scottish clubs. He was blamed for {{a goal that}} they conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup Final, in a match {{in which he was}} designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away. There have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers after his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding, but Ferguson himself makes it clear in his autobiography that Rangers knew of his wife's religion when he joined the club and that he left the club very reluctantly, due to the fall-out from his alleged cup final mistake.|$|E
25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His {{unbridled}} behavior and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that he slammed the friend dead against the ground. Egil <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E
6000|$|Gillian {{followed}} Maura, who was {{no sooner}} out of hearing than she began: 'It is too bad {{of him to}} <b>be</b> <b>so</b> cross. Kally really <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset!</b> She did not sleep all night, and I thought she would have fainted quite away this morning!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, John; Bob {{has told}} you all, of course? A queer, strange, perplexing thing, isn't it? I can't {{make it out}} at all. There must be {{something}} wrong in the woman, or it couldn't have happened. I haven't <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> for years.' ...|$|R
25|$|One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, {{an early}} settler of Kentucky and a {{prominent}} businessman. Hart {{proved to be}} an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Clay's most notable client was Aaron Burr in 1806, after the US District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss indicted him for allegedly planning an expedition into Spanish Territory west of the Mississippi River. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr. Some years later Thomas Jefferson convinced Clay that Daveiss had been right in his charges. Clay <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to shake his hand. Clay's legal career would continue long after his election to Congress, and in the 1823 Supreme Court case, Green v. Biddle, Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Shankly's death, {{training}} was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield. The Labour Party conference stood in a minute's silence {{for a man who}} had always been a socialist. Sir Matt Busby, the former Manchester United manager, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that he refused to take any telephone calls from people asking him for a reaction. Tributes poured in from the world of football, especially from the former players of all Shankly's clubs. Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting: [...] "In my opinion, he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century".|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mendelssohn was {{wary of the}} more radical musical {{developments}} undertaken by some of his contemporaries. He was generally on friendly, if sometimes somewhat cool, terms with Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and Giacomo Meyerbeer, but in his letters expresses his frank disapproval of their works, for example writing of Liszt that his compositions were [...] "inferior to his playing, and [...] only calculated for virtuosos"; of Berlioz's overture Les francs-juges [...] "the orchestration is such a frightful muddle that one ought to wash one's hands after handling one of his scores"; and of Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable [...] "I consider it ignoble", calling its villain Bertram [...] "a poor devil". When his friend the composer Ferdinand Hiller suggested in conversation to Mendelssohn that he looked rather like Meyerbeer– they were actually distant cousins, both descendants of Rabbi Moses Isserlis– Mendelssohn <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that he immediately went to get a haircut to differentiate himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} ask that, Mrs. Dr. dear," [...] Susan replied wrathfully. [...] "I have not <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> in years. That--that--that pacifist has {{actually}} had {{the audacity to}} come up here and, in my own kitchen, to ask me to marry him. HIM!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{future of}} Roxbury was {{represented}} in her," [...] said then-Roxbury City Council member Bruce C. Bolling. [...] "That's why people <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> and angry.

50|$|Danny Travis <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> {{that when}} a city {{official}} comes to evict him from the premises, he takes the man hostage. A television reporter, Paula Herbert, turns public sympathies for and against Travis, prolonging the story opportunistically as a Los Angeles police captain, Gerrity, attempts to defuse the situation.|$|R
500|$|On August 5, 1951, after a Sonny Boy Williamson II {{recording}} session, Elmore James recorded [...] "Dust My Broom" [...] at Ivan Scott's Radio Service Studio in Jackson, Mississippi. James, {{who provided}} the vocals and amplified slide guitar, is accompanied by Williamson on harmonica, Leonard Ware on bass, and Frock O'Dell on drums. [...] The recording studio had not made the transition to tape technology, so the group was recorded direct-to-disc using one microphone. [...] It was the only song recorded by James; Trumpet's McMurray felt that his other songs were not suitable for recording. [...] However, Williamson and James' cousin, Homesick James, later claimed that McMurry secretly taped the performance and that Elmore <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> that {{he was unable to}} record a B-side. McMurray denied this and presented a check made out to and endorsed by James the day before the session to show his knowledge of and agreement to participate in the recording.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ward, then a {{probate court}} judge in Wayne County, said that Ford never {{mentioned}} the incident to him, but that Ford's brother later {{told him about}} it. [...] “Jerry was very concerned,” Ward recalled. [...] “His brother told me, ‘Jerry <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> he wrote father asking him if he should quit the team. He was that angry.’” [...] At Ford's funeral, President George W. Bush also spoke about the Willis Ward incident. Bush said: “Long before he was known in Washington, Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership. As a star football player for the University of Michigan, he {{came face to face}} with racial prejudice when Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game. One of Michigan's best players was an African American student named Willis Ward. Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play. Gerald Ford was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand, and for the University of Michigan for caving in. He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to. The stand Gerald Ford took that day was never forgotten by his friend.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In October Lunsford and McConnell were {{statistically}} tied in the polls. Larry Sabato, {{director of the}} University of Virginia Center for Politics, said [...] "If Lunsford is actually doing this well, its got to be because the public <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>upset</b> by the economic meltdown and may be blaming the legislative leaders." ...|$|R
