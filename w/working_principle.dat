5|$|Watson's basic <b>working</b> <b>principle</b> is {{to parse}} {{keywords}} in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E

The <b>working</b> <b>principle</b> {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that they could work with either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|The quipu of the Incas was {{a system}} of colored knotted cords used to record {{numerical}} data, like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a yupana (Quechua for [...] "counting tool"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The <b>working</b> <b>principle</b> of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 {{an explanation of the}} mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.|$|E

Population of this study consisted of all BİTEFOs working in the city of Hatay. Analyses of the data showed that BİTEFOs’ job satisfaction level was at medium level. From the sub dimensions of the scale, the lowest job satisfaction level was observed in private life, whereas the highest one was success-motivation. From the particular factors influencing their job satisfaction level, the ambiguity and oldness of the BİTEFO’s job description and <b>working</b> <b>principles</b> seem to be the reasons of low job satisfaction level. Because of that, a new frame of BİTEFO job definition and <b>working</b> <b>principles</b> was offered to remove the determined problems based on job satisfaction leve...|$|R
2500|$|West's {{fluctuating}} {{attitude towards}} Christianity was offset {{by a more}} constant form of belief. She was informally a Manichaean all her life. Although she was critical of Manichaeanism's puritanical excesses, she did believe in dualism as the most fundamental <b>working</b> <b>principle</b> of the universe. Although she conceded, optimistically, that [...] "it {{is not possible to}} kill goodness," [...] she also indulged in pessimistic statements like [...] "natural man is mean," [...] which is as much as saying that she adhered to the Manichaean belief that the essence of goodness was diffused inside gross matter like particles of light trapped in darkness. In accordance with this Manichaean skepticism, West wrote in a draft of her own memoirs: [...] "I had almost no possibility of holding faith of any religious kind except a belief in a wholly and finally defeated God, a hypothesis which I now accept but tried {{for a long time to}} reject, I could not face it." ...|$|E

But I submit that universal forgiveness would hardly do as a <b>working</b> <b>principle.</b> Even those who are most apt and facile with the incident of the woman taken in adultery commonly cherish a secret respect for the doctrine of eternal damnation; {{and some of them are}} known to pin their faith to the penal code of their state. Moreover there is some reason to believe that the sinning woman, being [...] "taken," [...] was penitent--they usually are when found out.|$|E

In this review article, the authors addressed the issues regarding energy conversion cells in a fresh and broad perspective. The authors checked different energy conversion paths from solar energy to electrical energy and showed a simple picture of energy conversion. The authors then went through the <b>working</b> <b>principles</b> of solar cells in terms of charge carrier generation, separation and transport/collection. The comparison between different energy conversion cells, including solar, thermoelectric, electrochemical and photoelectrochemical cells by exploring the <b>working</b> <b>principles</b> of each kind of these cells was studied.
