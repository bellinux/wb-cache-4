She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E

2500|$|In early July 2006, {{when asked}} if he would debate Owens, he said he [...] "wouldn't debate her on how to bake a {{chocolate}} cake." [...] Franchot campaigned strongly as the [...] "only real Democrat in the race." [...] On September 5, 2006, Schaefer told Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher that Janet Owens is a [...] "prissy little miss" [...] who wears [...] "long dresses, looks like Mother Hubbardit's sort of like she was a man." [...] He made additional comments that she was [...] "getting fat." [...] Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: [...] "She's got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. [...] You know it sort of makes you real mad." [...] On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, [...] "Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?" [...] to which he responded, [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win – whatever I do – I'm gonna send her some Style magazines." [...] His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. [...] Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter [...] "taking the keys away from grandpa." [...] In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. [...] One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. [...] The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out [...] "the elephant in the room" [...] that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens' appearance, saying, [...] "An apology? An apology for what? I can't help it how she looks." [...] Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, [...] "This was started not by me." [...] He added, [...] "There's dirty politics, and then there's filthy politics." ...|$|E
