25|$|It {{should be}} {{strongly}} emphasized that this {{separation of the}} Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a low-energy approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an irreducible whole, and the components <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> neglected {{to arrive at the}} Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime – antimatter and the idea of creation and annihilation of particles.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to transverse waves, {{there are many}} wave motions where the oscillation {{is not limited to}} directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> done.|$|E

25|$|The constructions <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> given play {{an entirely}} {{analogous}} role {{with respect to}} Heyting algebras to that of Lindenbaum algebras with respect to Boolean algebras. In fact, The Lindenbaum algebra B'T in the variables {A'i} {{with respect to the}} axioms T is just our H'T∪T1, where T1 is the set of all formulas of the form ¬¬F→F, since the additional axioms of T1 are the only ones that need to be added in order to make all classical tautologies provable.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation {{by other}} teams through {{additional}} high-precision RVs {{would be most}} welcome. But if GJ 581g is confirmed by further RV scrutiny, {{the mere fact that}} a habitable planet has been detected this soon, around such a nearby star, suggests that η could well be on the order of a few tens of percent, and thus that either <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery.|$|E
25|$|The act for {{the most}} part simply reiterates {{existing}} provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E

25|$|There {{are serious}} {{difficulties}} {{arising from the}} structure of the Poisson brackets involving the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints. In particular, the algebra of (smeared) Hamiltonian constraints does not close, it is proportional to a sum over infinitesimal spatial diffeomorphisms (which, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> noted, does not exist in the quantum theory) where the coefficients of proportionality are not constants but have non-trivial phase space dependence – as such it does not form a Lie algebra. However, the situation is much improved by the introduction of the master constraint.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity through which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> passed has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for better things.|$|E

[...] If these physicists are correct, we would gain a kind of self-abnegating intellectual honesty or realism, but we would pay a hefty price, since few idealizations have proven as fruitful in physics as the notion of a point particle (however troublesome it has been even in simpler theories).|$|E

Thiers told the monarchist deputies, [...] "In {{the presence of the}} enemy, who will soon be outside Paris, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one thing to do; to retire from here with dignity."
