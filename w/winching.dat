After salvaging the capsized USS Oklahoma with <b>winching</b> cables, the Navy unsuccessfully tried to recover the Utah using the same technique.

25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the <b>winching</b> rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the <b>winching</b> rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and <b>winching</b> system together was required.|$|E

The place contains the largest surviving assemblage of early boiler and steam engine power plant recorded in North Queensland. The cyanide plant is amongst the earliest and most intact recorded in North Queensland and the tailings bucket chain and stumps and supports for the vats are now rare remains. The site contains a very rare undertype semi-portable steam engine and <b>winching</b> unit and a 4.5m high vertical boiler which is the largest of this type recorded in North Queensland. The pump shaft contains the only surviving beam pump arm recorded in the Georgetown-Croydon district.|$|E
25|$|The {{phrase is}} said to have {{originated}} one day when Coggeshall's town clock chimed 11 times at noon. When the villagers heard that the town clock at Lexden had struck 12 times at 11 o'clock, they rode to the town to collect the missing stroke. Other jobs included <b>winching</b> up a cow onto the church roof to eat the grass growing there, knocking down one of two windmills as there would not be enough wind for both of them, attempting to divert the course of the river with hurdles, hanging sheets over roads to prevent the wind from blowing disease into the town, chopping the head off a lamb to free it from a gate, removing stairs from a house to stop flood water entering and some appropriated from other 'fool centres', for example the classic 'fishing for the moon'.|$|E
500|$|A new {{upper body}} {{was used for}} the Sd.Kfz. 9/1 which mounted a [...] {{capacity}} crane in lieu of the crew's bench seat and the cargo compartment. It was issued to tank maintenance units beginning in September 1941. A larger, gasoline-electric, [...] crane was fitted on the later Sd.Kfz. 9/2, but this required outriggers to stabilize the vehicle before operations could begin. There was also a tank recovery version with a giant spade-like metal plate connected {{to the rear of the}} frame. The spade holding frame could be lifted straight up for transport. It was meant to stabilize the vehicle while <b>winching</b> a heavy object on soft ground.|$|E
5|$|Powered <b>winches</b> {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One <b>winch</b> was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the <b>winches</b> were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. <b>Winch</b> brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the <b>winch's</b> main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled <b>winch</b> operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The <b>winches</b> on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|R

2500|$|Edgartown Police Chief James Arena {{arrived at}} the scene about 10 or 15 minutes later. After {{attempting}} unsuccessfully to examine {{the interior of the}} submerged vehicle, Arena summoned a commercial diver along with equipment capable of towing or <b>winching</b> the vehicle out of the water. Diver John Farrar arrived at 8:45 equipped with scuba gear and discovered Kopechne's body; he extricated it from the vehicle within 10 minutes. Police checked the car's license plate {{and saw that it was}} registered to Kennedy. Kennedy was still at the pay phone by the ferry crossing and heard that his car and Kopechne's body had been discovered; he crossed back to Edgartown and went to the police station. Gargan simultaneously went to the hotel where the [...] "boiler room girls" [...] were staying to inform them about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reality in}} the bell-chamber {{is a very small}} and roughly-finished room, only {{partially}} protected from gales by louvred, unglazed windows on all sides. A massive and braced hardwood frame fills the room completely from west to east. The frame is over [...] high and is smooth and polished to the touch. On the south and north sides there are narrow squeeze spaces of about [...] between the frame and the wall. There is no aid to access {{to the top of the}} frame. The wheels of the top tier of bells project above the frame. The frame exactly fits the room, and the bells exactly fit the frame, but only because their wheels are arranged in different directions to allow fit. Access to the roof would require a slim and agile climber who would then climb a ladder, and from the ladder lift and slide with one hand a very heavy insulated trapdoor. The trapdoor is weatherproofed by being shaped to overhang the lips on which it is seated. The survival of the frame and consequently the safety of the bells depends on the condition of this trapdoor and the roof. It is likely that the tower's floors were installed after hanging the bells: the frame could then be built in place, the bells winched from the floor of the tower, and the floors would then be put in. <b>Winching</b> the bells up through the tower would require a massive beam across the tower roof to support the pulley; no such beam exists now.|$|E
50|$|An air <b>winch,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} an air hoist or air tugger, is an air-powered version of a <b>winch.</b> It is commonly used for the lifting and the suspension of materials. In the oil and gas, construction, and maritime industries, air <b>winches</b> are frequently preferred to electric, diesel, and hydraulic <b>winches</b> because of their durability, versatility, and safety.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Winch</b> Baronetcy, of Hawnes in the County of Bedford, was a {{title in}} the Baronetage of England.
