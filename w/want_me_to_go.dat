I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E

500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E

2500|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{who flew}} back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick {{departure}} and heated responses to questions about why he left the state.

Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.|$|E
