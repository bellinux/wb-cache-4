Not that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> prodigious texts, but there's a consistency between the lyrical subject and content and {{the presentation of the}} music". Immerwhar described his lyrics as expressing feelings of alienation and banality.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was {{directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins. It was shot the weekend of October 11–13, 2009 in Los Angeles {{over the course of}} several nights, filming some of the city's most iconic landmarks. Leto explained, [...] "I think this city is a beautiful place at night, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> empty streets, and it's kind of a haunting, forgotten landscape... very serene." [...] The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists. Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his friends did Critical Mass and Crank Mob, [...] "groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America," [...] and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of [...] "Kings and Queens".|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2008 article, online {{publication}} Electronic Intifada {{revealed the}} existence of a Google group set up by CAMERA. The stated purpose of the group was [...] "help us keep Israel-related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors". In follow-up e-mails to his recruits, Ini emphasized the secrecy of the campaign: [...] "There is no need to advertise the fact that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>these</b> group discussions," [...] he wrote. [...] "Anti-Israel editors will seize on anything to try to discredit people who attempt to challenge their problematic assertions, and will be all too happy to pretend, and announce, that a 'Zionist' cabal ... is trying to hijack Wikipedia." [...] Someone leaked four weeks' worth of communications from within Ini's organization, and the quotes weren't pretty. Describing the Wiki-campaign, a member of Ini's corps writes: [...] "We will go to war after we have built an army, [...] it, trained." [...] There is also some back-and-forth about the need to become Wikipedia administrators, to better influence the encyclopedia's articles. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5eI81uvfP?url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/05/03/war_of_the_virtual_wiki_worlds/ |archivedate=2009-02-02 |deadurl=no |df= }} Electronic Intifada accused CAMERA of [...] "orchestrating a secret, long-term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged". Andre Oboler, a Legacy Heritage Fellow at the Israeli non-governmental organization NGO Monitor, responded that [...] "Electronic Intifada is manufacturing a story." ...|$|E

These colours are either uniform or distributed in dots, striae, or moss-like marks; they depend in some cases on the colour of the cotyledons seen through the skin, and in other cases on the outer coats of the pea itself. In the different varieties, the pods contain, according to Mr. Gordon, from eleven or twelve to only four or five peas. The largest peas are nearly twice as much in diameter as the smallest; and the latter are not always borne by the most dwarfed kinds. Peas differ much in shape, being smooth and spherical, smooth and oblong, nearly oval in the QUEEN OF THE DWARFS, and nearly cubical and crumpled {{in many of the}} larger kinds.|$|E
