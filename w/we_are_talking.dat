25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of stars in the sky, hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E

We reject {{all of the things}} that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam. When we talk about the shari'a, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about only the shari'a. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about rejecting the U.N., the IMF, and the World Bank." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the group}} {{addresses}} social issues including corruption, environmentalism, personal liberty, and Latin American identity. Canción de Alerta contains the song [...] "Por qué cantamos," [...] {{an adaptation of}} Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti's poem of the same name. Author Eunice Rojas cites this {{as an example of}} the group using [...] "the power of music to advance social causes." [...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the love that elevates and purifies your soul. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> in the sense of the love that sets you free." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike today's AS, autistic psychopathy {{could be}} found in people of all levels of intelligence, {{including}} those with intellectual disability. Asperger defended the value of high-functioning autistic individuals, writing [...] "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers." [...] Asperger also believed some would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life. His paper was published during wartime and in German, so it was not widely read elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{served as}} {{executive}} producer for the series, directed {{most of the}} episodes, wrote several of them, and oversaw the filming and production of them all, {{to ensure that they}} had the correct [...] "tone". The show's production process was lengthy; Mirkin would rise at [...] to film the show, write further episodes from [...] until , and then repeat that the following day. Unlike most single-camera shows, which have around six days to film, Mirkin had to film each episode in two days. He enjoyed doing it, but described it as [...] "not a healthy way to live". Due to the logistics of filming the show, especially its many sets and effects, Mirkin convinced Fox to not film it in front of a studio audience and use a laugh track instead. The show achieved steady ratings in its first season, finishing 92nd out of the [...] listed in the Nielsen ratings. However, for its second season, it was moved from [...] on Sunday to [...] on Saturday and lost the bulk of its audience; it was canceled after that second season finished in 1992. In a 1999 piece about the show's DVD release, Tom Shales praised the show, concluding, [...] "At its best, Get a Life achieved dizzying heights of surrealist farce. At its worst, it was at least amusingly idiotic existential slapstick. Get a Life is a television classic unlike any other. For one thing, most of the others are better. We're not talking Playhouse 90 here, after all. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> riotous nonsense, and that's not to be sneezed at. It's to be laughed at. Hard." [...] A strong cult following subsequently developed, and Mirkin noted that although the show was canceled [...] "ultimately we got the audience I was hoping for and they are super dedicated and passionate to this day." ...|$|E

[...] After Volkova had her second surgery for her ligaments, she officially confirmed that she and Katina are planning to reunite t.A.T.u. However, soon Volkova told an interviewer {{that they are not}} reuniting after all.

2500|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{momentum}} spectrum is continuous, and one can conclude that for energy state described by the [...] wavenumber, the momentum can, when measured, attain also other values than , although these are the most likely momentum values (the momentum wavefunction attains its greatest values at these momentum values). Hence one also sees that since the energy is [...] (since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about the n:th energy eigenstate) the relation [...] does not necessarily hold; here p is the measured momentum (since the energy eigenstate [...] is not a momentum eigenstate, and actually not even a superposition of two momentum eigenstates, as one could imagine from equation (...) above, it has no well-defined momentum before measurement).|$|E
2500|$|A {{memorandum}} {{from the}} President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: [...] "What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds {{boils down to}} one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, {{but the only way}} to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about national frontiers--in a state of peace--then we will work toward restoring them.' But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis." ...|$|E

In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as Nina Berberova remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom. Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'.
