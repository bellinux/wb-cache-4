25|$|At Rabaul, General Imamura {{was still}} {{convinced}} that the Allies {{did not mean to}} stay long at Torokina—he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a stepping stone. He thus had no interest in mounting a decisive counterattack on the Allied beachhead using the substantial number of troops he already had {{in the southern part of}} Bougainville. Instead, he reinforced the Buka Island area, just off the north coast of the larger island, believing it to be the Allies' real target. Thus, the Army repeated the error of Guadalcanal, while the Navy could not convince Imamura of the Americans' real intentions.|$|E
25|$|Once {{while serving}} as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a {{volunteer}} became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> meningitis with life-threatening complications {{that could not be}} treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000. The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order, but she told them she did not need anyone's permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.|$|E
25|$|After {{committing}} {{to build the}} statue, Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell, where he met veterans of Task Force Dagger. He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him {{to be sure he}} got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E

500|$|By mid-December, the {{government}} had received around 1,500 letters related to Patton, with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion. [...] Kuhl's father, Herman F. Kuhl, wrote to his own congressman, stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that he not be disciplined. Retired generals also weighed in on the matter. Former Army Chief of Staff Charles P. Summerall wrote to Patton that he was [...] "indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident", adding that [...] "whatever [...] did" [...] he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "justified by the provocation. Such cowards used to be shot, now they are only encouraged." [...] Major General Kenyon A. Joyce, another combat commander and one of Patton's friends, attacked Pearson as a [...] "sensation mongerer," [...] stating that [...] "niceties" [...] should be left for [...] "softer times of peace." [...] In one notable dissension, Patton's friend, former mentor and General of the Armies John J. Pershing publicly condemned his actions, an act that left Patton [...] "deeply hurt" [...] and caused him to never speak to Pershing again.|$|E
2500|$|Hill {{commanded}} the 2nd Infantry Division at the Battle of Talavera. The {{night before the}} battle, Marshal Claude Victor mounted a surprise attack, swept aside two battalions of the King's German Legion and seized a key elevation. As Hill later recounted, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the old Buffs, as usual, making some blunder." [...] Nevertheless, he led a reserve brigade forward in the dark. In the short clash that followed, Hill was briefly grabbed and nearly captured by a Frenchman, but his troops recovered the summit. This is the first occasion on which Hill supposedly swore.|$|E
2500|$|The {{life history}} of Macrosoma heliconiaria was {{originally}} described from plants of Byttneria aculeata in Mexico. This was a historical breakthrough into {{the biology of}} hedylids. In this study, Kendall commented notably [...] "I thought the larvae might represent a satyr species, but when the first larva pupated I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pierid. The first adult emerged as a complete surprise. The pupa...is secured by girdle and cremaster, not unlike a pierid". Macrosoma cascaria was later also reared on this plant in Panama. More life histories are now known. From these data, known host plants span {{a wide range of}} (according to the APG II system) rosid dicotyledonous plants, including the rosid order Myrtales family Melastomataceae (genera Miconia, Conostegia, and Ossaea), the eurosid I order Malpighiales, families Euphorbiaceae (Croton), and Malpighiaceae (Byrsonima), the eurosid II orders Sapindales, family Rutaceae (Zanthoxylum) and more commonly Malvales, family Malvaceae, tribes: Bombacoideae (Ochroma), Malvoideae (Hampea and also Hibiscus, Byttnerioideae (Byttneria aculeata, Theobroma) and Grewioideae (Luehea). The [...] "green lizard caterpillar" [...] Macrosoma tipulata attacks an economically important local fruit tree [...] "Cupuaçu" [...] (Theobroma grandiflorum) in Brazil and can defoliate saplings; the biology of this species has been studied and illustrated in some detail. The larva of this species lives about 15 days in 5 instars, the pupal stage lasts about 7 days and the adult lives about 10 days. M. tipulata and many other species can be found as adults through most of the year.|$|E
