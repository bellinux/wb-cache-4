The model is {{expressed in terms of}} the same dimensionless parame-ters that are commonly used in modeling of the conventional axial flow desiccant wheel. In addition a dimensionless geometrical ratio of the volume of the matrix to the volume of the <b>wheel</b> <b>core</b> is found to affect the performance of the wheel. A finite difference technique on staggered grid is used to discretize the governing dimensionless equations. The discretized equations are solved to predict the perfor-mance of the desiccant wheel at given values of operation parameters. A sensitivity study is carried out to investigate the effect of changing any of these parameters on the performance of the wheel. The performance of the radial flow desiccant wheel is compared with that of the convential axial flow desiccant wheel having the same values of the operation parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the assessment of an experimental setup for grinding experiments with a top wheel speed of 250 m/s. Among other considerations, high speed grinding is widely considered as a way for enhancing material removal rates by utilising large depths of cut and/or high workspeeds. Performing high speed grinding operations, however, presents challenges to the setup due to the high wheel speeds involved. An experimental setup was established in this study for high speed grinding of hardened nodular cast iron and steel using vitrified CBN wheels. This setup was assessed prior to grinding for wheel balancing and guarding, <b>wheel</b> <b>core</b> expansion and temperature rise, grinding fluid delivery, and idle power consumptions. It was found that high speed wheel rotations caused wheel expansion and temperature rise. A significant portion of the total power was consumed on actions other than material removals. The preliminary grinding tests indicated that the setup met the requirements for high speed grinding in general. Copyright 9 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

40|$|Grinding is an {{important}} manufacturing technique widely used in industry. Despite their great significance, grinding processes still lack in sensoring, monitoring and assessment qualities. The main obstacle in realizing full in-process control of grinding in industry today is principally the lack of sufficient and reliable information obtained directly from the grinding zone. This is clearly caused by the difficult accessibility for conventional measuring techniques. A new approach to get information about temperatures and forces is the wheel based measurement of these process parameters, followed by telemetric data transfer. This concept offers an efficient monitoring of the grinding process, which constitutes {{the basis for the}} generation of new control strategies. Within this doctoral thesis macroscopical demonstrators have been built to prove the suitability of the sensor-equipped approach. For this purpose, conventional sensors such as a three-dimensional force sensor and wire thermocouples were implemented into the grinding layer. A telemetric unit attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>core</b> contained the signal conditioning and performed the data transfer to a stationary receiver. By this way, observance of the key parameters within different grinding operations as closely as possible to the machining point was enabled and so observance of process efficiency and tool status was realized. In detail, the demonstrators were used for contact detection, monitoring of dressing and grinding and detection of tool fracture. After the feasibility study using macroscopic sensors the miniaturisation of the sensors was taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|Acute aerobic {{exercise}} {{has been shown}} to elicit physiological changes characteristic of the acute phase response (APR), a nonspecific host defense response. Regular evocation of these changes may prime the immune system to improve resistance to disease. Because food deprivation is associated with an impaired APR, food restriction may prevent these beneficial changes. We tested the hypotheses that voluntary exercise elicits an APR and that food restriction modifies this response in four groups of hamsters: ad libitum-fed sedentary, ad libitum-fed exercised, food-restricted sedentary, and food-restricted exercised. Five variables altered during an APR were examined: core temperature, serum iron, serum interleukin- 6, serum amyloid A, and serum glucocorticoids measured by biotelemetry, colorimetric analysis, B- 9 cell growth assay, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and radioimmunoassay, respectively.

From the seven wheels studied the {Mn 8 Dy 8 } and {Mn 8 Y 8 } analogues exhibit SMM behavior as determined from ac susceptibility experiments in a zero static magnetic field. From DFT calculations a S= 16 ground state was determined for the {Mn 8 Y 8 } complex due to weak ferromagnetic Mn-III-Mn-III interactions. Ab initio CASSCF+RASSI-SO calculations on the {Mn 8 Dy 8 } wheel estimated the Mn-III-Dy-III exchange interaction as - 0. 1 cm(- 1). This weak exchange along with unfavorable single-ion anisotropy of Dy-III/Mn-III ions, however, led to the observation of SMM behavior with fast magnetic relaxation. The orientation of the g-anisotropy of the Dy-III ions is found to be perpendicular to the plane of the wheel and this suggests the possibility of toroidal magnetic moments in the cluster. The {Mn(8) Ln(8) } clusters reported here are the largest heterometallic Mn(III) Ln(III) wheels and the largest { 3 d- 4 f} wheels to exhibit SMM behavior reported to date...|$|R
40|$|Logging {{security}} incidents is a required security measure in every moderately complex computer system. But while most systems produce {{large quantities of}} textual logs, these logs are often neglected or infrequently monitored by untrained personnel. One {{of the reasons for}} this neglect is the poor usability offered by distributed repositories of plain text log data, using different log formats and contradictory terminology. The use of security visualization has established itself as a promising research area, aiming to improve the usability of security logs by utilizing the visual perception system's abilities to absorb large data quantities. This thesis examines {{the state of the art}} in security log usability, and proposes two ideas to the areas of security log usability and security visualization: First, we introduce LogWheels, an interactive dashboard offering remote monitoring of security incident logs, through a user friendly visualization interface. By offering three levels of granularity, LogWheels provides both an overview of the entire system, and the opportunity to request details on demand.

50|$|Almost all longboard {{wheels are}} made from urethane. The {{performance}} of longboard wheels is determined by five characteristics: height, lip shape, contact patch, durometer, and hub setting. Typical longboard wheels range from 65 to 107 mm in diameter. A taller wheel will have slower acceleration but a faster rolling speed. Smaller wheels have the opposite effect. The durometer of a wheel is how hard the urethane is. A softer wheel will be ultimately slower than a harder wheel on smooth surface. When the road surface gets rougher a softer wheel provides a smoother, faster ride. The fastest duro for the normal road is around 80a. Softer wheels have more grip than harder wheels on any surface. The contact patch of a wheel is {{the width of the}} section of the wheel that makes contact with the road. Generally, the wider the wheel, the more traction it will have. Wheels can be anywhere from 50 to 100 mm in width, but most commonly between 60 and(-) 70 mm. The shape of the lip has a noticeable effect on traction. Rounded lips are made to break loose into a slide and square lips are made to grip. Square lipped wheels do break loose but the slide is not as smooth as that of a round lipped wheel. A <b>wheel</b> hub (or <b>core)</b> is the plastic (or sometimes aluminum) center of a wheel that holds the bearings. The position of the hub affects the properties of the wheel.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Human gammaherpesvirus (GHV) infections, such as with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), are {{associated}} with fatigue and elevated concentrations of cytokines. Murine GHV- 68 (MuGHV) {{has been used as}} a model of EBV. However, the behavioral impact of infection with MuGHV is unknown. METHODS: Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (25 – 28 g at time of surgery) were housed in cages containing running wheels and infrared detectors to measure activity. Mice were administered vehicle intranasally (I. N.) at dark onset and recordings of EEG, body temperature and activity were made for 4 days. Mice were inoculated I. N. at dark onset with 400 PFU (n= 13) or 40, 000 PFU (n= 8) of MuGHV and recordings continued for 30 days. Mice were then injected intraperitoneally (I. P.) at dark onset with vehicle and 24 h control recordings obtained. The mice were injected I. P. with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recordings continued for 5 days. Mice housed in the same conditions were inoculated I. N. with vehicle and sacrificed after 4 days or inoculated with 400 PFU or with 40, 000 PFU MuGHV and sacrificed 5, 9, or 26 days after inoculation. Brain tissue, blood, spleen, and lung were collected, and stored at - 80 °C until assay. RESULTS: Infected mice showed decreases in <b>wheel</b> running activity, <b>core</b> body temperature, food intake and body weight. Mice inoculated with 40, 000 PFU of MuGHV had increases in NREM sleep, sleep fragmentation, and wakefulness during the peak of viral replication. Responses of infected mice to LPS were exacerbated. Cytokine concentrations and profiles in brain and the periphery were altered during infection. The alterations in cytokine profiles differed in a complex manner depending on dose of MuGHV. Based upon reductions in wheel running, these results indicate that mice become chronically fatigued during infection with MuGHV. Chronic infection is associated with long-term changes in thermoregulatory mechanisms and the ability of the immune system to respond normally to subsequent challenge. Virus-induced alterations in central cytokine profiles with respect to those in the periphery suggest potential mechanisms that may lead to fatigue. These studies demonstrate the utility of MuGHV as a model for post-viral fatigue infection...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The Environmental Conditioning System (ECS) was {{designed}} to evaluate the water sensitivity of asphalt concrete mixtures. The ECS subjects asphalt concrete specimens {{to a series of}} conditioning cycles including water flow, elevated and/or lowered temperature, and repeated axial loading. The purpose of this research was to: (1) evaluate the ECS test apparatus and procedure, and (2) determine whether the ECS can identify asphalt concrete mixtures that will perform well, or poorly, in the field with regard to water sensitivity. Twelve primary field test sections were identified. For each section, specimens were prepared in the laboratory using the original mix design (or the mix design identified by extraction), and the original aggregates, asphalts, and admixtures. Specimens were tested using two procedures: the ECS and the Oregon State University (OSU) <b>wheel</b> tracker. Field <b>cores</b> were used to evaluate in-situ mixture performance. Nine additional mixtures that have historically experienced water damage were tested in a limited secondary test program. Analyses were performed to determine the mixture properties that were significant in the prediction of mixture performance in the ECS. Mixture type was consistently the most significant predictor of ECS modulus ratio (change in mixture stiffness), degree of visual stripping, and binder migration, which were the performance indicators for water sensitivity evaluated in the ECS. Additional analysis indicated the existence of correlations among the ECS response variables. Significant correlations were found between the coefficient of water permeability and the degree of visual stripping; and between specimen deformation and the degree of visual stripping and binder migration. Mixture performance was compared between the ECS and the OSU wheel tracker and the field. Results indicate that the ECS test procedure can distinguish the relative performance of mixtures, with regard to water sensitivity, and mixture performance in the ECS correlates well with performance in the OSU wheel tracker. No correlation was found between mixture performance in the ECS and mixture performance in the field for the primary test sections. However, the primary field sections are relatively young, and water damage is expected to manifest itself in the future in those pavements identified as water sensitive by the ECS. The ECS predicted failure in the secondary mixtures which were identified as having had poor performance with regard to water sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{process and}} outcome of psychoanalytic {{psychotherapy}} {{have been studied}} for a long time. However, the experiences of patients, particularly in therapies where goals were not met, {{have not yet been}} the target of extensive research. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy with young adults might face particular challenges. The overall aim of this thesis was to explore the experiences of young adults in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, with a particular focus on differences between suboptimal therapies and therapies with generally good outcome. The setting was naturalistic, and perspectives of the patient, therapist and observer were combined. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Study I explored experiences of psychotherapy process and outcome among seven patients in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, who expressed dissatisfaction. Interviews at termination and 18 months later were analysed using grounded theory and compared to therapist experiences. Patients experienced abandonment with their problems in and after therapy, since therapy according to the patients lacked connections to daily life, as well as flexibility, activity and understanding from the therapist. Therapists presented a different picture of the same therapies, mainly focused on the difficulties of the patients. Study II analysed the experiences of 20 non-improved or deteriorated young adult psychotherapy patients at termination of therapy and 36 months later. Non-improvement and deterioration were calculated based on the reliable change index on self-rating scores. The grounded theory analysis of interviews established spinning one’s <b>wheels</b> as a <b>core</b> category. The relationship to the therapist was described as artificial, although at times helpful. Participants experienced their own activity in life and active components of therapy as helpful, but thought focus in therapy was too much on past experiences. Study III explored the experiences of 17 young adult patients, in psychoanalytic individual or group therapy, overcoming depression. The analysis of interviews from therapy termination and 18 months later indicated that finding an identity and a place in life were perceived as intertwined with symptom relief. Negative experiences included difficulties to change oneself, fear of change, and problems in therapy, such as too little activity on the therapist’s part. The results were discussed in relation to young adulthood, therapeutic alliance, mentalization, and attachment. The conclusion was expressed in a comprehensive process model of suboptimal therapy with young adults, with suggested ways to prevent such a development. The therapist’s meta-communication and correct assessment of the patient’s mentalization capacity from moment to moment are proposed as crucial. Regarding clinical implications, therapists of young adult patients need to establish meta-communication on therapy progress, as even experienced therapists might be unaware of dissatisfaction or deterioration. Meta-communication could be considered part of the treatment itself, as it may foster mentalization and good outcome. Further, the period of young adulthood entails decisions and developing an adult life, and therapists need to make room for this by active interventions...|$|R
