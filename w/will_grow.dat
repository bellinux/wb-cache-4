Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some species <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> on limestone. Narcissus scaberulus <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> on granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops <b>will</b> <b>grow.</b> As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which <b>will</b> <b>grow.</b> The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E

5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> in clay, sand, {{acid and}} even {{alkaline}} soils, {{and it shows}} good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly regarded as a low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|Maeser also {{inspired}} a relationship between Meissen, where he was born, and Provo, Utah. Now, the two cities share a sister-city relationship. It is the hope of both cities that the relationship <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody <b>will</b> <b>grow</b> rich.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that <b>will</b> <b>grow,</b> and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
