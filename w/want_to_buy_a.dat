500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E

[...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest {{is not going to get}} you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

60|$|Odd, thought I to myself, decidedly odd. These American husbands, {{they must}} be a {{delicate}} type of humanity. The wonder is their mothers ever reared them. They marry fine girls, the majority of them; two or three sweet children are born to them, and after that {{there appears to be}} no further use for them, as far as this world is concerned.

Not the customary tonic, I don't mean, the sort of tonic merely intended to make gouty old gentlemen feel they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> hoop, but the sort of tonic for which it was claimed that three drops poured upon a ham sandwich and the thing would begin to squeak.|$|E

60|$|Major Stede Bonnet, {{the father}} of Kate, whose mother had died when the child was but a year old, was a middle-aged Englishman of a fair estate, in the island of Barbadoes. He had been {{an officer in the}} army, was well educated and intelligent, and now, in {{vigorous}} middle life, had become a confirmed country gentleman. His herds and his crops were, to him, the principal things on earth, with the exception of his daughter; for, although he had married for the second time, there were a good many things which he valued more than his wife. And it had therefore occasioned a good deal of surprise, and more or less small talk among his neighbours, that Major Bonnet should <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> ship. But he had been a soldier in his youth, and soldiers are very apt to change their manner of living, and so, if Major Bonnet had grown tired of his farm and had determined to go into commercial enterprises, it was not, perhaps, a very amazing thing that a military man who had turned planter should now turn to be something else.|$|E
6000|$|... “I joke very seldom,” Blunt protested earnestly. “That’s why I haven’t {{mentioned}} His Majesty—whom God preserve. That {{would have}} been an exaggeration. [...] . However, the end is not yet. We were talking about the beginning. I have heard that some dealers in fine objects, quite mercenary people of course (my mother has an experience in that world), show sometimes an astonishing reluctance to part with some specimens, even at a good price. It must be very funny. It’s just possible that the uncle and the aunt have been rolling in tears on the floor, amongst their oranges, or beating their heads against the walls from rage and despair. But I doubt it. And in any case Allègre is not the sort of person that gets into any vulgar trouble. And it’s just possible that those people stood open-mouthed at all that magnificence. They weren’t poor, you know; therefore it wasn’t incumbent on them to be honest. They are still there in the old respectable warehouse, I understand. They have kept their position in their quartier, I believe. But they didn’t keep their niece. It might have been an act of sacrifice! For I seem to remember hearing that after attending for a while some school round the corner the child had been set to keep the books of that orange business. However it might have been, the first fact in Rita’s and Allègre’s common history is a journey to Italy, and then to Corsica. You know Allègre had a house in Corsica somewhere. She has it now as she has everything he ever had; and that Corsican palace is the portion that will stick the longest to Doña Rita, I imagine. Who would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> place like that? I suppose nobody would take it for a gift. The fellow was having houses built all over the place. This very house where we are sitting belonged to him. Doña Rita has given it to her sister, I understand. Or at any rate the sister runs it. She is my landlady [...] .” ...|$|E
