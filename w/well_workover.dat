In this paper, a laboratory evaluation was conducted with fuzzy-ball fluids as killing fluids. The results show that, the fuzzy-ball fluid, with a density of 0. 5 – 1. 5  g/cm 3 and a viscosity up to 78, 50, 000  mPa·s at a low shear rate, realizes controllable performance and forms piston-like plugging slugs of solid-free high structural strength on natural gas wellbore after bonding. During <b>well</b> <b>workover,</b> multiple fluid column pressures were set up by injecting fuzzy-ball fluids with different densities at various rates. Owing to high structural strength of the fluids at a low shear rate, natural gas breaks through only inside the piston-like slug and cannot flow upwards to the ground, so the pathways of natural gas in the wellbore are isolated from the ground surface. Moreover, the fluid can wholly move up and down like a piston-like plug, with the change of formation pressures or the tripping of pipe strings. Like the conventional operations, the production can be restored after the workover, so long as the fluid in wellbore is cleaned by means of gas lift. In a natural gas field in NW China, where the formation pressure coefficient dropped to 0. 60 – 0. 82, three wells were fully filled with fuzzy-ball workover fluids for 7 days and another three wells were treated with the piston-like plugs of fuzzy-ball workover fluids for only 3 days.

30|$|Asphaltene {{precipitation}} {{and subsequent}} deposition in porous medium {{as well as}} in the flowlines causes expensive flow assurance issues worldwide. Changes in pressure, temperature and composition of oil may cause asphaltene precipitation and deposition (Leontaritis and Mansoori 1987; Zahedi et al. 2009; Rassamdana et al. 1996; Branco et al. 2001; Mofidi and Edalat 2006; Eskin et al. 2016; Kord et al. 2014). These changes could happen during different in situ recovery processes such as natural depletion, gas injection, and chemical flooding as well as during production and transportation of the produced crude in flowlines (Mansoori 1997; Zanganeh et al. 2012; da Silva Oliveira et al. 2014).

40|$|In recent years, {{the natural}} gas {{industry}} has developed more technologically challenging unconventional gas reserves such as tight sands, shale and coalbed methane. Completion of new <b>wells</b> and re-working (<b>workover)</b> of existing <b>wells</b> in these tight formations typically involve hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir to increase well productivity. Industry reports that hydraulic fracturing is beginning to be performed in some conventional gas reservoirs as well. Removing the water and excess proppant (generally sand) during completion and well clean-up may result in significant releases of natural gas and therefore methane emissions to the atmosphere. The U. S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990 - 2009 estimates that 68 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane are vented or flared annually from unconventional completions and workovers. Reduced emissions completions (RECs) – also known as reduced flaring completions or green completions – is a term used to describe an alternate practice that captures gas produced during well completions and <b>well</b> <b>workovers</b> following hydraulic fracturing. Portable equipment is brought on site to separate the gas from the solids and liquids produced during the high-rate flowback, and produce gas that can be delivered into the sales pipeline. RECs help to reduce methane, VOC, and HAP emissions during well cleanup and can eliminate or significantly {{reduce the need for}} flaring. RECs have become a popular practice among Natural Gas STAR production partners. A total of thirteen different partners have reported performing reduced emissions completions in their operations. RECs have become a major source of methane emission reductions since 2000. Between 2000 and 2009 emissions reductions from RECs (as reported to Natural Gas STAR) have increased from 200 MMcf (million cubic feet) to over 218, 000 MMcf.

Such a tool can help operators of legacy, low volume {{oil and gas}} assets to maximize their asset value by allocating capital towards the best <b>well</b> <b>workover</b> options to achieve equitable production increases. The framework for this model was constructed by following interventions taken in a marginal oil field in the Permian Basin from {{the time it was}} acquired in 2013 through 2016. The Green Tree decision model quantifies historic uncertainty in outcomes and uses the probabilistic present values of all interventions to display the optimum path value in a decision tree. Relatively few inputs are needed for the decision tree to show an optimum intervention path. These inputs include historic production data for the field, service costs for each wellbore workover, anticipated production increase from each workover, and expected probabilities for each intervention based off of the operator?s historical results. Once the inputs have been entered, the user is able to manually adjust the projected commodity prices and see the corresponding changes in the optimum path value. The Green Tree is applied to the Permian basin asset to identify the optimum sequence of interventions, revealing the risk adjusted upside to the base case PV 10 for the field calculated in the workbook. A summation of the expected monetary values (EMVs) from several interventions can be used to estimate the total upside value to the asset owner. The tool developed here may benefit marginal well producers in evaluating asset value when looking at an acquisition or divestiture. Lastly, posterior probabilities can be used in this model as the results of actual workovers in the field are examined, adjusting the tree in real time to account for any changes in the outcome of probabilities or production responses...|$|E
30|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered in}} oil production {{have been associated}} with heavy organics such as paraffin/wax, resins, asphaltenes, diamondoid, mercaptans and organometallic compounds in crude oil in various quantities and forms. Such compounds could precipitate out of the crude oil solution due to various forces causing blockage in the oil reservoir, in the well, in the pipelines and in the oil production and processing facilities (Mansoori 1995). Solid particles suspended in the crude oil may stick to the walls of the conduits and reservoirs. The toughness of the precipitates creates a lot of damage in the production and processing facilities whether there is asphaltene present in the crude oil even in minute quantities. Asphaltenes, which are highly polar compounds, could act as glue and mortar in hardening the deposits and, as a result, causing barrier to the flow of oil. Hence, this research is directed towards the determination of n-alkanes, resins and asphaltenes in various crudes as the economic implications of these problems are tremendous, considering the fact that a problem <b>well</b> <b>workover</b> for cleaning out asphaltene restrictions and restoration of well productivity could get as high as {{a quarter of a million}} dollar (Leontaritis and Mansoori 1988). The tackling of this problem is beset with a lot of shortfalls such as the unavailability of an adequate precipitation theory, lack of sufficient understanding of the process to adopt a rational approach to develop more effective dispersants and inhibitors. Unstable asphaltenes can form a separate phase that might plug the oil-bearing rock formation near a well. They can also aggregate at oil/water interfaces where they stabilize water-in-oil emulsions or at oil/solid interfaces where they can alter surface wetting properties or accumulate and plug well bores and flow lines. The first step towards predicting and avoiding any of these problems is knowing how to evaluate asphaltene stability.|$|E

Optimization of the Palinpinon 1 production field has become an urgent requirement with the increasing power demand of the Visayas Grid in Central Philippines. Projected short-fall may reach> 100 MW {{at the end of}} Y 2005. Add to this, the current steam production of the field has declined over the past twenty years of continuous exploitation barely meeting the requirement of the 112. 5 MW power plant due to pressure drawdown, injection returns and wellbore blockages. Shifting the brine injection farther away from the production sector and <b>well</b> <b>workovers</b> in conjunction with acid stimulation have been successful in controlling the consequent adverse effects but recurrence of these problems only keeps the steam supply at a manageable level. Make-up and replacement wells could boost steam production but these are highly susceptible to the same problems encountered at present. The recent exergy assessment of the Palinpinon 1 production field implies that the current power generation can still be increased significantly with the existing steam production. The Utilization Efficiency, ŋu indicated that less than 40 % of the maximum energy at the wellhead has been converted to electrical power. Exergy calculations from the wellhead down to the power plant showed that significant potential energy of the brine can still be harnessed to produce additional power for the plant before returning it back to earth.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Proper reservoir characterization is the key to successful implementation of improved oil recovery programs. The recovery efficiency of any reservoir is mainly controlled by its heterogeneity. Interwell connectivity is considered as a direct measure of reservoir heterogeneity. This study uses a hydraulic interwell connectivity concept to characterize sandstone reservoirs. It defines and investigates the Interwell Flow Capacity Index (IFCI) to quantitatively characterize the reservoir connectivity. This approach is an integrated study of reservoir characterization, geostatistics, production performance and reservoir engineering. In this study IFCI is quantitatively defined as the ratio of observed fluid flow rates in any two adjacent wells in a producing unit. Geostatistics and fluid dynamics are used to evaluate the reservoir connectivity. The spatial variation of IFCI can be used to describe the degree of communication between injectors and producers, to evaluate the reservoir rock quality and to describe the production-injection performance. The spatial distribution of IFCI can also serve as a guide to modify water injection patterns, select infill <b>well</b> locations, define <b>workovers</b> and other operational strategies for waterflooding. A Colombian (South America) sandstone producing unit, La Cira Field "C Zone", is used to illustrate the application of IFCI concept. This zone has been subdivided into 16 genetic units. The CIC genetic unit (average reservoir permeability of 31 md and sand thickness of 6 feet) is used as an example to illustrate the application of this approach. The geological model is improved by incorporating the IFCI, which helps to define the flow units. IFCI model is a practical approach to evaluate the injection and production performance of existing waterflood patterns.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} done in {{collaboration}} with Aker Solutions Subsea AS and proposes how one could securely cope with uncontrolled drift-off where the marine riser experience excessive moments and/or tension that will damage the well integrity and structure while the <b>well</b> is undergoing <b>workover</b> or intervention. This weak link design is meant to release the riser from the well structure before damage occurs, either when excessive moments, tension or both {{have the potential to}} damage the structure. The release mechanism should work as a 3 rd barrier, and by itself, with no input from the operator, make the riser disconnect safely. The mechanism should also secure the well so that the surface vessel can safely drift-off from position. The preliminary study project, which was finished in December 2010, produced several interesting concepts. One was chosen for further study and analysis in the master thesis by the candidate, Aker Solutions representatives and the supervisor from NTNU. In this thesis, the concept has been further developed, analyzed and dimensioned to cope with relevant example and extreme loading conditions provided by Aker Solutions Subsea AS. The concept developed in this thesis is based on an idea of a standard ANSI flanged connection. By using pressurized CO 2, the flange geometry produces a separation pressure which forces the flange bolts to break, thus separating the riser connection and disrupting the communication between the surface vessel and the subsea equipment. The system is initiated by a battery powered offset monitoring system which measures the riser offset at a position 55 meters above the EDP. When the separation has been initiated, the hydraulic pressure and control signal connection between the operator and the subsea well is terminated, thus closing the wellbore by utilization of the failsafe valves in the subsea tree and/or well control package. Analyses of the final concept in Abaqus show that the dimensions and geometry copes well with the applied loading condition. The weak link bolts are designed to break if subjected to a limited tension force. This enables the present weak link to be applied as a replacement for existing links which are solely based on tension response. </p...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe push in the {{industry}} towards increasing the weather window for marine operations offshore leads to a focus on new technology. When performing workover operations in a subsea <b>well,</b> the <b>workover</b> riser is a physical connection between the well and the floating workover vessel. A floating vessel will experience wave induced motion and is therefore equipped with a heave compensator to allow for this relative motion without increasing the load to the riser. If the heave compensator fails or if the heave of the vessel exceeds the stroke length of the heave compensator, the workover riser can be subjected to an excessive axial force that could rupture the riser and damage subsea well barriers. A safety joint {{that is to be}} installed in the riser can improve the window for safe operation while reducing consequences if an accident were to occur. It is called the Telescopic Safety Joint (TSJ) and has been developed by FMC Technologies. The joint is designed to telescope when subjected to a predetermined axial force. The telescoping function of the joint will ensure that there is sufficient time for personnel onboard the vessel to activate the emergency disconnect function so that the riser can safely be disconnected from the well. The safety joint is a weak link. During installation of the workover system, the riser experiences loading conditions exceeding that of normal operation. There is a concern that the safety joint may take plastic damage during this installation. Hence the TSJ is equipped with an over-ride function that temporarily can increase the strength of the joint. The over-ride function works by pumping hydraulic pressure into external cylinders. The increase in the strength of the joint from the over-ride function depends upon the hydraulic pressure. This thesis studies the effect the over-ride function has on the weather window for installation of a workover system, comparing a fully pressurized over-ride function to a semi-pressurized over-ride function. Simulations in Orcaflex for various environmental conditions found the loads that the TSJ must be able to withstand for installation to be possible. A model of the joint was created in AUTODESK Inventor. Using ANSYS workbench, the model was tested to find out which loads that are acceptable and which loads leads to plastic damage of the joint both for the fully pressurized and semi-pressurized over-ride function. Combining the results for the fully- and semi-pressurized over-ride function test, with the results from the dynamic simulations performed in Orcaflex revealed an increase in installation window when using the fully pressurized over-ride function. The joint using the full capacity of the over-ride function was able to withstand 620 kNm before plastic damage took place. The joint using a semi-pressurized over-ride function began taking plastic damage at 400 kNm. The over-ride function increases the bending moment capacity of the joint by 55 %. Using the scatter diagram for the Draugen field to see how many observations has been made of the different sea states, the increased availability for installation when using the full capacity of the over-ride function, as opposed to the semi-pressurized joint was calculated. When installing the TSJ as the 2 nd riser joint, the availability increased by 21, 7 %. Installing the TSJ as the 3 rd joint increases the availability by 16, 7 %. Installation of the TSJ on the 4 th and 5 th joint gives an increase of respectively 2, 8 % and 0, 3 % when the full over-ride capacity is used. The over-ride functions proved to be so effective that the joint became stronger than the actual workover riser. Hand calculations showed that the riser would yield before the safety joint and thus the safety joint would not be a limiting factor for the workover installation activity if the over-ride function is active...|$|R
