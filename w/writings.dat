5|$|The {{books and}} letters written by Bahá'u'lláh cover {{religious}} doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, {{social and moral}} teachings as well as Bahá'í laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baha'u'llah's <b>writings,</b> states that {{he wrote in the}} different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical <b>writings,</b> <b>writings</b> about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, <b>writings</b> about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, <b>writings</b> calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his works are considered by Bahá'ís to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of his better known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the Hidden Words, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-Íqán.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} the <b>writings</b> of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The <b>writings</b> of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the <b>writings</b> and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the <b>writings</b> of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, {{and those of}} the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important <b>writings</b> include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 12thcentury, {{important}} socio-political changes {{took place in}} the Deccan, south of the Krishna river. During this period, the Hoysalas, native Kannadigas from the Malnad region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power. They are known to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10thcentury when they distinguished themselves as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana defeated the Cholas of Tanjore and annexed Gangavadi (parts of modern southern Karnataka), thus bringing the region back under native rule. In the following decades, with the waning of the Chalukya power, the Hoysalas proclaimed independence and grew {{into one of the most}} powerful ruling families of southern India. Consequently, literature in Kannada, the local language, flourished in the Hoysala empire. This literature can be broadly subdivided as follows: works dominated by the themes of Jain <b>writings,</b> contrasting works by Veerashaiva writers not belonging to the vachana poetic tradition, rebuttals to Shaiva <b>writings</b> from Jain writers, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the birth of the Bhakti (devotional) movement in the Kannada-speaking region, <b>writings</b> on secular topics, and the first <b>writings</b> in native metres (ragale, sangatya and shatpadi).|$|E
