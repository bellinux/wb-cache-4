5|$|Females are not territorial, {{and live}} {{alone or with}} their offspring. Juveniles form mixed-sex groups after weaning, {{but most of the}} young females stay back <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> with whom they do not show any {{significant}} interaction. Males eventually mature and try to acquire territories.|$|E
5|$|The female {{raises the}} young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation. Sometimes, a second litter is born {{as late as}} September. The female {{generally}} gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months, they begin to travel <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother.</b> They hunt by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter. In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> {{as late as the}} next spring.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{during a}} standard toy choosing situation {{of a group}} of 10 autistic children, each together with his mother, was compared with that {{of a group of}} 10 physically handicapped children <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> 10 emotionally disturbed children <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> and 10 subnormal children <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Bales' interaction process analysis was employed for recording the interaction observed, and significant differences between the autistic and other groups were found. These differences supported hypotheses derived from the literature on mother-child interaction in autism and schizophrenia. The reliability and implications of the findings are discussed, together with the value of the approach used. <p...|$|R
25|$|While {{women were}} held {{separately}} from men, the law permits children {{to stay in}} prison <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> until age four. Press reports estimated that 86 {{children under the age}} of four lived <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> in federal prisons, with an additional 75 in Buenos Aires provincial prisons. In general men's prisons were more violent, dangerous, and crowded than the women's prisons.|$|R
5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother.</b> The eight-year-old Charles {{already had a}} taste for natural history and collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Gyllenhaal's first films—her {{feature film}} debut {{at the age}} of 15, Waterland (1992); A Dangerous Woman (1993); and Homegrown (1998)—were {{directed}} by her father; the last two also featured her brother; they had supporting roles as children. <b>With</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> she and Jake appeared in two episodes of Molto Mario, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network. After graduating from college, she played supporting roles in films like Cecil B. Demented (2000) and Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). Gyllenhaal later achieved recognition in her own right playing her real brother's on-screen sister in the indie cult hit Donnie Darko (2001).|$|E

40|$|Adult female {{survivors}} of incest (n= 68) {{were compared to}} other women (n= 93) <b>with</b> respect to <b>their</b> relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and female friends. For the most part, incest survivors {{did not differ from}} other women in terms of their friendship networks or the quality of their closest female friendships. However, they did report lower levels of interpersonal competence. Survivors described relatively poor relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> who were seen by them as socially isolated and lonely. Measures of relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> friends were largely independent of those assessing relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> These results imply that incest indeed affects the relationships adult survivors share with other women, particularly <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> but also indicate that negative consequences are not always present. Many aspects of friendships with other women seem resilient and may serve as a positive foundation for therapeutic interventions...|$|R
50|$|Mary Byrne, a Columbia University nursing {{professor}} {{is in the}} process of conducting a study of 100 children born at the prison nurseries at the Bedford Hills and Taconic Correctional Facilities in Westchester County, N.Y. in order to evaluate the impact that prison nurseries have on parent-child bonding, and healthy infant development.So far, Byrne has concluded that some children are able to form a secure attachment <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> when they are kept in prison <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> She notes that children who are separated from their parents have an increased likelihood of emotional and behavioral disorders, school failure and trouble with the law if they live in temporary arrangements <b>with</b> relatives while <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> is in prison. Because mothers play a crucial role in the development of their children, often times children are punished by not having the ability to have time alone <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> She did not study outcomes for children born to prison inmates who are immediately placed for adoption.|$|R

25|$|Gorilla infants are {{vulnerable}} and dependent, thus <b>mothers,</b> <b>their</b> primary caregivers, {{are important to}} their survival. Male gorillas are not active in caring for the young, but they do {{play a role in}} socialising them to other youngsters. The silverback has a largely supportive relationship with the infants in his troop and shields them from aggression within the group. Infants remain in contact <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> for the first five months and mothers stay near the silverback for protection. Infants suckle at least once per hour and sleep <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> in the same nest.|$|R
50|$|Most {{dairy farms}} {{separate}} calves from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> {{within a day}} of birth to reduce transmission of disease and simplify management of milking cows. Studies have been done allowing calves to remain <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> for 1, 4, 7 or 14 days after birth. Cows whose calves were removed longer than one day after birth showed increased searching, sniffing and vocalizations. However, calves allowed to remain <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> for longer periods showed weight gains at three {{times the rate of}} early removals as well as more searching behavior and better social relationships with other calves.|$|R
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E

5|$|After birth, {{the mother}} cleans the cubs, and can then {{recognize}} each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% {{of her time}} with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they have achieved full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.|$|E
5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later.
