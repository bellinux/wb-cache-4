25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different <b>weighting</b> <b>curve,</b> ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Weighting</b> <b>curve</b> is a graph {{of a set}} of factors, {{that are}} used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound level measurement where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E
25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{examine whether}} drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and restrictive/binge eating-purging subtype at {{admission}} moderates the <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> {{of patients with}} Anorexia Nervosa (AN) {{over the course of}} inpatient treatment. METHOD:: The nature of <b>weight</b> <b>curves,</b> individual differences herein and moderating factors are examined in 92 AN patients by means of multilevel modeling. RESULTS:: The average <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> of AN patients is characterized by a linear weight increase during treatment that levels off near the end of treatment. Substantial individual differences exist in the shape of patients' <b>weight</b> <b>curves.</b> Patients with stronger body dissatisfaction at admission display a slower linear rate of weight gain over the course of treatment. Neither drive for thinness nor restrictive/binge eating-purging subtype predicted patients' <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> over the course of treatment. DISCUSSION:: Body dissatisfaction moderates patients' <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> over the course of inpatient treatment but more research on factors determining <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> is needed.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop birth weight {{references}} for twins. Mean birth weights of individual twins are lower than those of singletons, hence singleton birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> may not be suitable to assess twin birth weights. Study design: Twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> were developed according to gestational age, gender, parity and mode of conception. The curves are based on population-based data of 40, 494 twins born in Flanders, Belgium between 1987 and 2007. Results: A different growth potential was found comparing the birth weights of twins and singletons. Twins deviate from the singleton curve from 30 weeks gestational age on. Conclusion: Our study underlines that singleton birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> differ from twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves.</b> We developed specific twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> can be used in clinical practice in order to follow growth patterns of twins in utero...|$|R

50|$|Developments in the 1960s, in {{particular}} the spread of FM broadcasting {{and the development of}} the compact audio cassette with Dolby-B Noise Reduction, alerted engineers to the need for a <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> that gave subjectively meaningful results on the typical random noise that limited the performance of broadcast circuits, equipment and radio circuits. A-weighting was not giving consistent results, especially on FM radio transmissions and Compact Cassette recording where preemphasis of high frequencies was resulting in increased noise readings that did not correlate with subjective effect. Early efforts to produce a better <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> led to a DIN standard that was adopted for European Hi-Fi equipment measurement for a while.|$|E

40|$|Weight {{restoration}} is {{an important}} treatment goal {{that is at the}} heart of treatment in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Recently, interest is growing in what constitutes an optimal <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> for <b>weight</b> restoration over the course of treatment. In this study, we examined the nature of <b>weight</b> restoration <b>curves</b> in 92 AN patients in an inpatient, specialized treatment program and whether drive for thinness, body attitude and bulimic features at admission moderate patients’ <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> over the course of treatment. Results indicate that the average <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> of AN patients is characterized by a linear weight increase over the course of treatment that levels off near the end of treatment. There exist, however, substantial differences between AN patients in the nature of their <b>weight</b> restoration <b>curves.</b> It appears that patients with bulimic features have a higher body mass index (BMI) at admission whereas patients with a more negative body attitude display a slower linear weight gain during the course of treatment. Drive for thinness predicted neither BMI at admission nor the nature of the patients’ <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> during treatment.

50|$|While {{the terms}} {{wow and flutter}} used to be used {{separately}} (for wobbles at a rate below and above 4 Hz respectively), {{they tend to be}} combined now that universal standards exist for measurement which take both into account simultaneously. Listeners find flutter most objectionable when the actual frequency of wobble is 4 Hz, and less audible above and below this rate. This fact forms the basis for the <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> shown here. The <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> is misleading, inasmuch as it presumes inaudibility of flutters above 200 Hz, when actually faster flutters are quite damaging to the sound. A flutter of 200 Hz at a level of -50db will create 0.3% intermodulation distortion, which would be considered unacceptable in a preamp or amplifier.|$|E
