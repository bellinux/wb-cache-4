50|$|The train {{consisted}} of three motor cars and two trailer cars. The motor cars were about twice as heavy as the trailer cars, and the trailers were significantly more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to never couple two trailer cars together, but to always have a single trailer between two motor cars. The heavier motor cars provided stability for the lighter trailers. In the Malbone Street <b>wreck</b> <b>train,</b> two trailers were coupled together, and it was these two cars, in order numbers 80 and 100, that sustained {{the bulk of the}} damage, both to the cars and to the passengers.|$|E

50|$|Stone studied {{chemistry}} and biology at Boston University, while also serving as assistant chemist to the Massachusetts State Agricultural Experiment Station from 1884-1886. He then {{studied at the}} University of Göttingen, receiving his Ph.D. there in 1888. From 1888 to 1889, he was chemist to the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station. In 1889 he joined Purdue University as a Professor of Chemistry, and conducted research in the chemistry of carbohydrates. After serving as Purdue's first vice president from 1892-1900, he {{became president of the}} university upon the death of James Henry Smart in 1900. During Stone's tenure, Purdue's schools of agriculture and engineering grew rapidly. President Stone was present at one of Purdue's worst tragedies, the Purdue <b>Wreck</b> <b>train</b> collision in 1903, tending to those who were injured or dying.|$|E

50|$|A <b>train</b> <b>wreck</b> or <b>train</b> crash {{is a type}} of {{disaster}} involving one or more <b>trains.</b> <b>Train</b> <b>wrecks</b> often occur as a result of miscommunication, as when a moving train meets another train on the same track; or an accident, such as when a train wheel jumps off a track in a derailment; or when a boiler explosion occurs. <b>Train</b> <b>wrecks</b> have often been widely covered in popular media and in folklore.|$|R

5000|$|Coach #460 is {{the only}} [...] narrow-gauge tourist-sleeper {{remaining}} from a group built in 1886 for the D&RG. In the early 1900s it was assigned to work service and was used on a D&RGW <b>wrecking</b> <b>train</b> as late as 1957. Then it was sold to the Black Hills Central Railroad in South Dakota. Then in 1983 the D&SNG purchased coach 460. It {{has yet to be}} restored.|$|R

5000|$|For example, in the U.S. {{state of}} California, {{the penalty for}} {{intentionally}} causing a non-fatal <b>train</b> <b>wreck</b> is life imprisonment {{with the possibility of}} parole. For a fatal <b>train</b> <b>wreck,</b> there are only two sentences which the court may impose: either life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty. [...] The willful <b>wrecking</b> of a <b>train</b> is punishable by death or life imprisonment without parole by the United States federal government.|$|R

The {{atmosphere}} becomes increasingly panicked as extensive searches fail to discover any trace of the <b>wrecked</b> <b>train,</b> either in {{the wreckage of the}} bridge or elsewhere in the river. Extra suspense is provided by the mystery of the [...] "ghost train" [...] which on stormy nights howls up the abandoned trackbed and suddenly vanishes on reaching the site of the bridge.|$|R

5000|$|Matuska's motives remain unclear. His first {{attack was}} {{initially}} {{thought to have}} been politically motivated. At his trial, Matuska claimed to have been ordered to derail the express by God.

[...] It was reported that he achieved orgasm while watching the trains he had sabotaged crash (a forensic examination of the trousers he had worn {{on the night of the}} fatal crash discovered evidence of semen stains).|$|R

5000|$|The unusual {{harshness}} of California's <b>train</b> <b>wrecking</b> statute {{has been}} expressly recognized by its appellate courts. The Supreme Court of California explained in 1972 that <b>train</b> <b>wrecking</b> {{is one of}} only eight crimes in the California Codes for which a capital sentence is authorized. [...] The California Court of Appeal pointed out the next year that (at that time) <b>train</b> <b>wrecking</b> was the only other crime besides aggravated kidnapping in the Penal Code for which the Legislature had expressly established the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.|$|R
40|$|<b>Train</b> <b>wrecks</b> are random {{events which}} have the {{potential}} to cause catastrophic losses in lives and property. Accurate information about wrecks becomes available slowly which can delay shareholder responses. The sub-set of <b>train</b> <b>wrecks</b> with passenger fatalities are associated with an immediate and significantly negative CAR. There is weak evidence of a delayed decline in shareholder wealth after a <b>train</b> <b>wreck.</b> No other wreck attribute (injuries, property damage, environmental damage, etc.) are systematically correlated with announcement period or subsequent returns. There is a highly significant rise in trading volume following <b>train</b> <b>wrecks,</b> which increase and remains high as long as six weeks after the wreck. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that uncertainty about the extent of losses is slow to be resolved. This uncertainty seems to elicit post-wreckage noise trading...|$|R
