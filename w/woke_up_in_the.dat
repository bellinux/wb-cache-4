5|$|Veronica has a {{dream that}} she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the winter with Logan, but she is plagued with visions of Madison. When she wakes up, {{she goes to the}} Hearst library, where Tim Foyle’s (James Jordan) girlfriend, Bonnie, asks her to {{investigate}} who slipped her RU-486, which caused a miscarriage. When Veronica presses Bonnie further, she reveals that Tim or Dick (Ryan Hansen) could be the father, although Tim has been very supportive. Veronica asks Logan point-blank whether Logan had sex with Madison over the winter, and he says yes, leading to a major fight, with Veronica saying she’ll never forgive him. Veronica speaks to Bonnie’s roommate, Phyllis (Toni Trucks), who reiterates that Tim is being very supportive. Veronica successfully breaks into Tim’s office to investigate before realizing she doesn’t have the password. After Keith comforts Veronica due to her breakup, she bugs Tim’s office.|$|E

25|$|Moriani is able {{to enter}} a secret passage in the hills leading into the Castle. In an {{underground}} labyrinth, he encounters Pekmester, who explains Florescu is a servant of Dracula. He went {{to see her in}} the dispensary hoping she would lead him to Dracula, but Dracula knocked him out, put him in the coffin and he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labyrinth. Eventually, Moriani enters the catacombs. Von Krüger arrives in the courtyard above, begging Moriani to let him down, but Moriani refuses. Florescu arrives, and reveals she is/was Calugarul. When she followed The Path with the intention of killing Dracula, he offered her immortality and her beauty back, and she accepted. She explains Pekmester killed both Luca and Boczow, and von Krüger {{is the head of the}} Thule Society, who wish for another World War. She wishes Moriani luck as Dracula himself approaches. However, Moriani ignites the bomb he disarmed at the inn, and the catacombs are destroyed. As Moriani dies, Pekmester laments they have lost their chance, but von Krüger assures him they will return. Unseen by any of them, a green vapour rises from the rubble into the air.|$|E

25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
500|$|This stage {{also saw}} a {{dramatic}} and life-threatening crash from Pedro Horrillo, on the Culmine di San Pietro. His bike skidded on wet leaves during the descent, causing him to lose control of his machine, slide into a guardrail, and tumble head over heels down the mountainside. Horrillo fell [...] and sustained fractures to his thighbones, kneecaps, and T12 and C3 vertebrae, {{as well as a}} punctured lung and internal bleeding. He was airlifted off the mountain and was then taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. Horrillo <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ambulance, but was put in a chemically induced coma to aid his treatment. He was taken out of the coma the next day, with scans revealing no brain damage. The peloton's protest of Stage 9 the next day was largely in reaction to Horrillo's serious injury.|$|E

Finding it to be [...] "very profound", he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the night}} and wrote down the lyrics. He said that his treatment of the topic is [...] "sincere", and that he believes it to be [...] "one that the military doesn't want you to know. They sweep it under the rug, but it's a story that needs to be told." [...] The band's guitarist, Kerry King, has said that [...] "these new songs [...] aren't political at all: 'Jihad', 'Eyes of the Insane' — it's what's spewing out at us from the TV." ...|$|E

He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|The weather at Manzanar caused {{suffering}} for the incarcerees, few {{of whom were}} accustomed to the extremes of the area's climate. The temporary buildings were not adequate to shield people from the weather. The Owens Valley lies at an elevation of about [...] Summers on the desert floor of the Owens Valley are generally hot, with temperatures exceeding [...] not uncommon. [...] Winters bring occasional snowfall and daytime temperatures that often drop into the [...] range. At night, temperatures are generally 30 to 40°F (17 to 22°C) lower than the daytime highs, and high winds are common day or night. [...] The area's mean annual precipitation is barely five inches (12.7cm). The ever-present dust was a continual problem due to the frequent high winds; {{so much so that}} incarcerees usually <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning covered from head to toe with a fine layer of dust, and they constantly had to sweep dirt out of the barracks.|$|E
500|$|On the bridge, Beyoncé sings {{about having}} drunken {{sex in the}} kitchen: [...] "We <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen saying / How the hell did this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing I {{remember}} is our beautiful bodies grinding off in that club". The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", {{a reference to the}} Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E

500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
