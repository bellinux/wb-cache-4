5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the wheel in two.|$|E

40|$|The {{utilization}} of <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> in Kagoshima Prefecture began {{first in the}} seventeenth century. During that time <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were used for suger cane presses, driving bellows and pounding gold ore. From the feudal clan period to the Meiji, Taisyo and Syowa periods, <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and turbines began {{to be used for}} many usages, e. g., rice-polishing, milling, producing bone meal, sweet potato starch, incense sticks, lumbering, driving mechanical dolls, pumping, generation of electricity, and so on. But they were to be finally replaced by steam engines, internal combustion engines and electric motors. Such a decline in <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> was owing to their special qualities, i. e., inability to increase their power greatly and the requirement of a nearby water supply, and moreover depending on the decrease of their users. Under such circumstances, research on the {{utilization of}} <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and turbines up to the present seems to be important, because this data is useful in the history of technology and usable for developing local energy in the future. In this report, the utilization of <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and turbines up to the present in the northwestern part of Kagoshima Prefecture is studied. It is shown that there are a hundred ninety four locations where <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are used for pounding gold ore, a hundred and one for rice-polishing and milling, ten for spinning, twelve for producing bone meal, and so on; the total number of these wheels and turbines is three hundred forty two...|$|R

5|$|The current {{paper mill}} building, whose <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is powered by}} a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II listed building. The {{commercial}} production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after owner Gerry Cottle concluded there was no longer a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Visitors to the site are still able to watch a short video of the paper being made from cotton. Other attractions include the dinosaur yard, a small museum about the cave and cave diving, a theatre with circus shows, a house of mirrors and penny arcades.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{rotating}} hydraulic {{machines that}} were introduced {{thousands of years}} ago to generate energy from <b>water.</b> Gravity <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are driven by the weight of the water flow and a portion of the flow kinetic energy. In the last decades, due to the increasing diffusion of micro hydropower plants (installed power less than 100 kW), gravity <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are being recognized as attractive hydraulic machines to produce electricity. Unfortunately, most of the engineering knowledge on <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> is dated back to the XIX century, with several gaps and uncertainty. Additional work is still needed to fully understand the power losses and the performance within <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> that could lead to further improvements in efficiency. The scope of the present thesis is the investigation and improvement of the performance of gravity <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> This aim was achieved using physical experiments to quantify <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> performance under different hydraulic conditions, theoretical models to estimate and predict the efficiency, and numerical simulations to optimize the design. Undershot, breastshot and overshot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were investigated, in order to give a wide overview on all the kinds of gravity <b>water</b> <b>wheels.</b> Sagebien and Zuppinger undershot wheels were investigated at Southampton University, under the supervision of prof. Gerald Muller, from October 2015 until April 2016. These two wheels differ based on the shape of the blades. The blades of Sagebien wheels are optimized to reduce the inflow power losses, while those of Zuppinger wheels are conceived to minimize the outflow power losses. The objective of the experiments was to understand which of the two designs is better in term of efficiency. The tests showed that the Sagebien type exhibits a more constant efficiency {{as a function of the}} flow rate and the hydraulic head than the Zuppinger type. The maximum efficiency (excluding leakages) was identified as 88 %. Breastshot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were investigated experimentally, theoretically and using numerical Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) methods at Politecnico di Torino. The maximum experimental efficiency was estimated as 75 % using a sluice gate inflow. A vertical inflow weir was also investigated, and found to have a more constant efficiency versus the rotational speed of the wheel, but with similar maximum values. A theoretical model that was developed to estimate the power output, power losses and efficiency, had a discrepancy with the experiments of 8 %. A dimensionless law was also developed to estimate the power output. Numerical CFD simulations were performed to understand the effects of the number and shape of the blades on the efficiency. The optimal number of blades was 48 for the investigated wheel, and the efficiency can be improved using a circular shape. The numerical discrepancy with experiments was less than 6 %. Overshot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> were investigated using a similar approach as done for breastshot wheels, and were found to have a maximum experimental efficiency of 85 %. A theoretical model was developed to estimate the power losses and the efficiency, in particular to quantify the volumetric losses at the top of the wheel, that is the fraction of the flow which can not enter into the buckets and that is lost. Then, numerical simulations will be started to try to improve the wheel efficiency, reducing the previous volumetric losses. More specifically, a circular wall around the periphery of the wheel was added to the original design, leading to a performance improvement up to 60 %. The results of this work show that <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> can be considered attractive hydropower converters...|$|R

By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> and gearing.|$|E

The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E

25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{invention}} of the watermill appears to {{have occurred in the}} hellenized eastern Mediterranean {{in the wake of the}} conquests of Alexander the Great and the rise of Hellenistic science and technology.

These include all three variants of the vertical <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> as well as the horizontal <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> Apart from its main use in grinding flour, water-power was also applied to pounding grain, crushing ore, sawing stones and possibly fulling and bellows for iron furnaces.|$|E
