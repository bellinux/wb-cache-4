40|$|Recirculation of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> from energy {{production}} to forest soil improves {{the sustainability of}} this {{energy production}} form as recycled <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> contains nutrients that otherwise would be lost at harvest. In addition, wood-ash is beneficial to many soils due to its inherent acid-neutralizing capabilities.

Here we investigate the response of bacterial communities in a spruce forest soil to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> addition corresponding to 0, 5, 22, and 167 t <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> ha- 1. We used culture-based enumerations of general bacteria, Pseudomonas and sporeforming bacteria combined with 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to valuate soil bacterial responses to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> application. Results showed that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> addition strongly increased soil pH and electrical conductivity. Soil pH increased from acidic through neutral at 22 t ha- 1 to alkaline at 167 t ha- 1.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on removal of color, COD, and lignin in {{wastewater}} of pulp and paper mill using white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> and black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> that generated from boilers unit in the pulp and paper mill.

The results from the equilibrium time experiment concluded that the equilibrium time of the white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> is much more rapid than the black <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> indicated as 2 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. The effect of pH on the removal of such studied parameters was different for the white and black <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> Variation in pH of wastewater at the levels of 2 to 10 had no influence in removal of color (89 - 93 %), COD (66 - 70 %) and lignin (78 - 82 %) when white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> was used, whereas the effect of pH on the removal was evident when using black <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> The highest removal of color (42. 2 %), lignin (31. 1 %) and COD (29. 7 %) was found when the initial pH was adjusted to 2 and such removal was gradually decreased when pH was raised. The optimum dose of white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> for the highest removal efficiency was 20 g ash /L of wastewater. This amount of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> can remove color 95 %, lignin 80 % and COD 69 %. The reason for high removal efficiency of white <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> might occur from the precipitation of lignin by CaO which is the major component of the ash. For the black <b>wood</b> <b>ash,</b> the optimum dose was calculated from the isotherm equation of adsorption, both by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm.

The {{management}} of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> {{is an important}} factor in the environmental and economic analysis of <b>wood</b> burning. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> can be applied to energy crops as a fertilizer, which can help replace nutrients removed during harvest. The objectives of this study were to examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of nutrient elements applied in <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> to an intensively cultured, short-rotation willow bioenergy system. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> was applied at the rates of 10 and 20 Mg haâ 1 yrâ 1 to coppiced willow, Salix purpurea, clone SP 3, from 1992 to 1994. The relative abundance of nutrients in applied <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> was Ca> K> Mg> P> N. There was little effect of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> on N or P concentrations in soil solution measured at 20 and 40 cm depth. Soil solution concentrations of base cations were elevated in the last two years of the study by 30 to 90 %, depending on the element and treatment, in plots receiving <b>wood</b> <b>ash.</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> treatments had little influence on foliar leaching. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> treatment also had few significant effects on willow growth or on the contents of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in foliage and stems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ash-based polymer {{composites}} are assum-ing increasing importance {{because of}} the pollutant poten-tial, fine particle size, and low price of ash. Fly ash and rice husk ash are two prominent ash materials on which some investigations have already been done for potential use in polymer composites. This article highlights {{the results of a}} study on the use of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> in HDPE. <b>Wood</b> <b>ash</b> is mainly a mixture of various metallic compounds and some silica. Here, the characterization of <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> has been done with the help of XRD, ICPAES, light scat-tering based particle size analysis, FTIR, and SEM. The results show that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> particle size has an average value of 293 nm, much lower than other categories of ash. When blended with HDPE {{in the presence of a}} compati-bilizer, <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> gives rise to vastly improved mechanical properties over that of the base polymer. The results prove that <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> is a valuable reinforcing material for HDPE and the environmental pollution due to <b>wood</b> <b>ash</b> can be solved in a most profitable way by this technique...|$|R
