500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} the single reached, {{it would be}} one of the Kinks' final hits in either Britain or America, ending the {{comeback}} the band had during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ray said in 1996, [...] " [...] wanted to quit in 1984, after 'Come Dancing.' I felt that that was the end of an era for the Kinks, and I wanted to stop the treadmill and step back and reappraise the whole thing, but we had another album to deliver. It seemed like <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> another album to deliver." [...] Mick Avory left the band in 1984, a year after [...] "Come Dancing" [...] peaked in the USA. He later said, [...] "I think leaving after a world wide hit with 'Come Dancing' was a good note to leave on." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E

500|$|Anthony is {{the older}} brother of Antonio Anderson, who is {{currently}} the assistant coach for the men's basketball team at Wheelock College in Boston. Antonio played college basketball with the Memphis Tigers under head coach John Calipari and was most notably named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. He has experience playing professional basketball in the NBA Development League and outside North America. He also played alongside Anthony with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2012. The National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed him to multiple 10-day contracts in February 2010. The two brothers' uncle, Marvin Avery, said, [...] "There's some in our family {{that have been in}} trouble, but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> Antonio and his brother [...] playing basketball or traveling somewhere to play basketball at all times." [...] When Anthony began playing at UMass, his younger brother became frustrated with basketball and wanted to play American football instead. However, Anthony and his uncles convinced him to continue playing basketball.|$|E
500|$|Many {{more news}} outlets, {{including}} magazines and {{websites such as}} GameSpy, GameSpot and IGN, all previewed Manhunt from late 2003 to early 2004, when the game was released on PlayStation 2, [...] Microsoft Windows and Xbox. Rockstar also released exclusive merchandise, limited editions and pre-order bonuses such as official soundtracks, a Piggsy figure, and a handheld voice changer. During {{the release of the}} first game, a former Rockstar employee admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that the team [...] had [...] "already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and —we were no strangers to it—but Manhunt felt different. With GTA, <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the excuse that the gameplay was untethered—you never had to hurt anybody that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up". The game became available through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on May 14, 2013, and for the PlayStation 4 on March 22, 2016.|$|E
500|$|However, Frusciante was not {{familiar}} with the funk genre of Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." [...] Several weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired. Soon after, Chad Smith was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's Mother's Milk. Frusciante focused on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer Michael Beinhorn disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic heavy metal tone, largely absent from the band's three preceding records. Frusciante and Beinhorn fought frequently over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's idea ultimately prevailed as Frusciante felt pressured by the producer's much greater knowledge of the studio. Kiedis recalls that [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." ...|$|E

500|$|Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (PIMS) {{began in}} Eva Evans's {{administration}} in 1994, {{and was a}} part of the SPIRIT program during the Linda White administration. Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, [...] "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> high GPA requirements. [...] And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls. [...] We need more black women in those fields." [...] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country. Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies. For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science. Also, a national P.I.M.S. Olympiad, deriving from knowledge of math and science, in conjunction with the PIMS Community Parade was held at the 58th Boulé in Dallas, Texas.|$|E
500|$|For the Borg battle, Knoll {{insisted on}} closeup shots that were near the alien vessel, necessitating a {{physical}} model. ILM layered their [...] model {{with an additional}} fiveinches of etched brass over a glowing neon lightbox for internal illumination. To make the Borg vessel appear even larger than it was, Knoll made sure that an edge of it was facing the camera like the prow of a ship and that the Cube broke {{the edges of the}} frame. To give the Cube greater depth and texture, Rosenberg shot the vessel with harsher light. [...] "I created this really odd, raking three-quarter backlight coming from the right or left side, which I balanced out with nets and a couple of little lights. I wanted it to look scary and mysterious, so it was lit like a point, and <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the camera dutched to it; we never just had it coming straight at us," [...] he said. Small lights attached to the Cube's surface helped to create visual interest and convey scale; the model was deliberately shot with a slow, determined pacing to contrast with the Federation ships engaged in battle with the Borg. The impact of Federation weaponry on the Borg Cube was simulated using a [...] model of the Cube. The model had specific areas which could be blown up multiple times without damaging the miniature. For the final explosion of the Cube, Rosenberg shot ten [...] Cube miniatures with explosive-packed lightweight skins. The Cubes were suspended from pipes sixtyfeet above the camera on the ground. Safety glass was placed over the lens to prevent damage, while the camera was covered with plywood to protect it from bits of plastic that rained down after each explosion. The smaller Borg sphere was a [...] model that was shot separately from the Cube and digitally added in post-production. The time-travel vortex the Sphere creates was simulated with a rocket re-entry effect; bowshock forms in front of the ship, then streams backwards at high speed. Interactive lighting was played across the computer-generated Enterprise model for when the ship is caught in the time vortex.|$|E

2500|$|On New Year's Day, 1868, Stephen Powers set {{out from}} Raleigh on a walking tour that, in part, would trace in reverse the march of Gen. William T. Sherman {{at the end of}} the Civil War. As a part of his report on North Carolina, Powers {{described}} the pine woods of the state and the making of turpentine. Having entered South Carolina, he recorded in his 1872 book, Afoot & Alone, that he spent the night [...] "with a young man, whose family were away, leaving him all alone in a great mansion. He had been a cavalry sergeant, wore his hat on the side of his head, and had an exceedingly confidential manner." [...] "You see, sir, the Tar‑heels haven't no sense to spare," [...] Powers quotes the sergeant as saying. [...] "Down there in the pines the sun don't more'n half bake their heads. <b>We</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> to show 'em whar the Yankees was, or they'd charge to the rear, the wrong way, you see." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2010s, the group began moving away from {{standard}} band instrumentation and began incorporating more elements of electronic dance music. In an interview with EDM Sauce, they talk about their transition being facilitated by frequent production and remixing on the side. Cash Cash stated, [...] "I think for us it was a slow evolution, because we were always remixing and producing for other artists and doing outside production." [...] In another interview with Only The Beat, the group stated, [...] "When we first started as a band our sound was [...] "poppy", but <b>we</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> underlying electronic elements to our music. Once we started changing and growing, our sound slowly began evolving." [...] The group's 2011 album Love or Lust was described by Under the Gun Review as [...] "dance/power pop...full of bass rhythms, synthetic claps, techno beats, and dance/party/club themes". Following releases and remixes were also received as electronica and electropop.|$|E

As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E
