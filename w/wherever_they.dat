5|$|Molecular {{biologist}} Robin Holliday {{has written}} {{that the absence of}} biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> would be of use.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} non-SI units {{that had never}} been {{formally}} sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation.

5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changing the course of events <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> appeared, and then just as quickly galloping away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.|$|E

5|$|Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic saint and priest Josemaría Escrivá, Opus Dei {{was given}} final Catholic Church {{approval}} in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. In 1982, by the apostolic constitution Ut sit, St. John Paul II {{made it a}} personal prelature—that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> are, rather than geographical dioceses.|$|E
5|$|Spain's {{worldwide}} {{military activities}} between the 14th and 17th centuries called for {{large numbers of}} horses, more than could be supplied by native Spanish mares. Spanish custom also called for mounted troops to ride stallions, never mares or geldings. Due to these factors, Spanish stallions were crossed with local mares in many countries, adding Spanish bloodlines <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> went, especially to other European breeds.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs.

On 14 December 1771, new letters patent were given to Guillaume and his partners, replacing the earlier ones. Under the new terms, all the land needed could be expropriated including two toises, or , of land on either side for tow paths. The builder could take materials <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> could be found.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E

5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E
5|$|Immigrant {{communities}} {{first developed}} in the riverside settlements. From the Tudor era until the 20th century, ships' crews were employed on a casual basis. New and replacement crew would be found <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> were available, local sailors being particularly prized for their knowledge of currents and hazards in foreign ports. Crews would be paid off {{at the end of}} their voyage. Inevitably, permanent communities became established, including colonies of Lascars and Africans from the Guinea Coast. Large Chinatowns at both Shadwell and Limehouse developed, associated with the crews of merchantmen in the opium and tea trades. It was only after the devastation of the Second World War that this predominantly Han Chinese community relocated to Soho.|$|E

5|$|Time {{spent in}} {{religious}} gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies {{and children who}} made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had {{to spend the day}} preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E
5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E

Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives.

5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|Day and Greene sounded out {{scientists}} and science communicators about their idea, enlisting {{many of their}} contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They met with {{the presidents of the}} city's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> went, and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City. Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation (SFF), a non-profit organization based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are Alan Alda, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger, the foundation's president Judith Cox, New York University president John Sexton, and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.|$|E
5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or <b>wherever</b> <b>they</b> liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E
