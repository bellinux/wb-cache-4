The book was popular, going into four editions between first publication in 1868 and 1889. In the Preface to the Cookery Book she denies [...] "the special knowledge of cookery with which Sir John so kindly credits me", but admits she has always been interested in the [...] "study", and that she had seen [...] "two other cookery books through the press for my friend the late Miss Hilda Duckett": these were Hilda's <b>Where</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> of Recipes (1899) and Hilda's Diary of a Cape Housekeeper (1902), both published by Chapman and Hall; but Frere's name had not appeared on their title pages.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{event in}} DXR {{synthesis}} is {{the selection of}} the propionyl-CoA starter unit and its decarboxylative addition to a two carbon ketide unit, derived from malonyl-CoA to produce the five carbon B-ketovaleryl ACP. [...] The five carbon diketide is delivered by the ACP to the cysteine sulfhydryl group at the KS active site, by thioester exchange, and the ACP is released from the chain. [...] The free ACP picks up another malonate group from malonyl-CoA, also by thioester exchange, with release of the CoA. [...] The ACP brings the new malonate to the active site of the KS <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> decarboxylated, possibly {{with the help of the}} CLF subunit, and joined to produce a 7 carbon triketide, now anchored to the ACP (see top of Figure 1).

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> really going?" [...] That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in.

2500|$|A special {{portion of}} Negoiţescu's essays {{deals with the}} meeting point between the {{currents}} of Romanian nationalism and the themes recovered by the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. During his exile years, he was especially vocal in condemning Constantin Noica's late essays, which communist authorities tolerated for their critique of the Western world. To Noica's claim that Westerners had been pushed to [...] "hate the world", forgetting their roots and heading for a collective disaster, he replied: [...] "Is there now {{a place in the}} world that is more evidently heading for catastrophe than Romania is? [...] Where has the world been tarnished and <b>where</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> still tarnished more than in Noica's homeland? Where o where is European culture more degraded at this time than in the country where the very monuments of European significance and value are being more and more systematically torn down or mutilated in every way conceivable?" [...] Deeming his adversary's statements [...] "an offense to liberty itself", Negoiţescu also placed Noica's isolationism and anti-Europeanism in connection with a common attitude in post-World War II Romania. According to this claim, the country had been abandoned by Europe: [...] "like Noica, whose writings have no echo in the Occident, [...] feel that they are shouting in the desert and curse the desert which does not hear and does not answer them." [...] He believed to have identified the roots of this mentality in the political and cultural clashes of the Cold War, extending his earlier comments regarding the continental alignment of Romanian culture: [...] "after 1947 our culture has been forcefully torn from its natural European context." ...|$|E
