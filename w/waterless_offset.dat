50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. <b>Waterless</b> <b>offset</b> presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|E

Four {{kinds of}} {{monomers}} {{were chosen to}} prepare ink to research the effect of monomer on the ink transfer performance of UV <b>waterless</b> <b>offset</b> and improve the printing quality. The rheological properties such as viscosity, yield value, thixotropy and stickiness were tested and the ink transfer equation was built, the ink transfer rate was calculated {{and the effect of}} monomer on the ink transfer performance was analyzed through the ink transfer experiment. The research results show that the type of monomers has large impact on the rheological properties of UV <b>waterless</b> <b>offset,</b> so the ink transfer performances with different kinds of monomers are different. And the viscosity, thixotropy, yield value and stickiness of the ink with TPGDA and EOEOEA are little, the ink transfer performance is better...|$|E

Design {{the formula}} of UV <b>waterless</b> <b>offset</b> ink, through {{changing}} {{the content of}} padding, different ink samples that with different rheological properties were made. Proof with the IGT printability tester, and the printing qualities of inks were tested. The influence of rheological properties on the printing quality of ink was analysis. The {{results show that the}} rheological properties influence the printing quality directly. The higher the viscosity of ink is, the bigger the thixotropy is, and the smaller the fluidity is. The solid density, gloss, ink-transfer rates and dot gain of the printed matter decrease with the increase of ink’s yield value...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of fillers on the transfer properties of UV <b>waterless</b> <b>offset</b> ink, four ink samples compound with different fillers(SiO 2, CaCO 3 and Talc) were prepared, the flow curve, thixotropy and ink transferred ratio were tested, {{and the effects of}} rheological properties on ink-transfer were discussed. The results show that: all of four ink samples show a typical shear thinning characteristics. Sample use SiO 2 and CaCO 3 as fillers has a higher viscosity, and with the increase of shearing rate, the viscosity decreased sharply. Sample use SiO 2 and CaCO 3 as fillers has the minimum thixotropic area, and the minimum thixotropy. Sample use SiO 2 and Talc as fillers has the largest thixotropic area, and the largest thixotropy. Sample use SiO 2 and CaCO 3 as fillers has the highest ink transfer ratio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMicroscopic {{analysis}} of paper printing shows regularly spaced dots whose random shape {{depends on the}} printing technology, {{the configuration of the}} printer as well as the paper properties. The modelling and identification of paper and ink interactions are required for qualifying the printing quality, for controlling the printing process and for application in authentication as well. This paper proposes an approach to identify the authentic printer source using micro-tags consisting of microscopic printed dots embedded in the documents. These random shape features are modelled and extracted as a signature for a particular printer. In the paper, we propose a probabilistic model consisting of vector parameters using a spatial interaction binary model with inhomogeneous Markov chain. These parameters determine the location and describe the diverse micro random structures of microscopic printed dots. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is thus developed to approximate the Minimum Mean Squared Error estimator. The performance is assessed through numerical simulations. The real printed dots from the common printing technologies (conventional offset, <b>waterless</b> <b>offset,</b> inkjet, laser) are used to assess the effectiveness of the model...|$|E
40|$|PAPRO {{operates}} {{within the}} Forest Research company and their {{mission is to}} develop value-addingindustry solutions. At present there are no good ways for mills to easily test the printing quality on newsprintpaper. There is a great need for a fast {{way to do this}} on different paper qualities; with a laboratory-offset press this can be both a time and money saving method. At PAPRO Forest Research, NewZealand, a laboratory offset press has been developed and designed, during the past seven years, concerningthis issue. Earlier projects were made concerning the press, e. g. to establish the optimal settings. The mission with this project was to partly determine the present variability of the print quality andto evaluate if the fountain solution, distilled water and 2 % Diol green concentrate, used at the momentmixed with different percentages of Isopropanol could decrease the variability and contribute to morestabile results. Throughout the whole project the print quality showed a high variation and was evenmore variable when the Isopropanol was added. All in all 50 print rounds times twelve printed paperstrips was carried out through the project divided into three parts. To analyse the print quality, amicroscope with an image capture camera has been used. Data from the taken images was analysedand inserted into charts to see the variations. The conclusions of the whole project are not satisfying because no final evaluations were possible tomake. Main conclusions are that the additive of Isopropanol to the ordinary fountain solution, used atpresent, only contributed to more unstable results of the print quality. And it seems to be difficult toget some stable results from the lab press as long as the room where it is placed is not fully conditionedas required for the process of offset printing. And the fact that the airbrush which applies theamount of fountain solution is also variable, as shown in earlier projects, which contributes to unstableresults as well. For further work more exact parameters as a conditioned room are required and thepossibility to further design the laboratory press to use <b>waterless</b> <b>offset</b> printing instead...|$|E
40|$|This degree project {{illustrates}} newsprint and <b>waterless</b> <b>offset.</b> A new news {{press was}} introduced at Drupa- 00, Cortina from KBA, {{which is the}} first news press dedicated the waterless technique. With actual statistics from the company in question an investigation was made whether their production fits this press. It came out in the investigation that the production of the company, from statistics, fits this press very good. A table was made where different timeschedules were accounted for the new press, with semi- and full automatic plate changing for present and to be added papers. The waterless technology is compared to conventional offset with the difference that the plate is based on a sort of laminatetechnology. Like conventional plates this plate has a base made of aluminium. Lightsensitive photopolymer isunited as a layer or coat on top of the aluminium and a 2 µm thin oleophobic siliconlayer is applied on top of the photopolymer. Considering the print, the waterless method has a higher qualitygrade than conventional offset. No water is emulsifiedin the ink, and therefore the printed dot gets a higher density. The loss of dampening solution and higher tack of the ink gives sharper dots. This makes the colourspace bigger why a greater range of colours can be printed. The loss of dampening solution gives a more stable dotgain, which contributes to that a higher screen can be used. The disadvantage is that the plate can't do as many rotations as the conventional plate. A waterless plate makes around 100 000 - 500 000 rotations before it needs to be removed owing to type- and manufacturer of the plate. The plate is also slightly more sensitive and expensive than conventional plates, around 1, 4 - 1, 7 × aluminium printing plates. A waterless system can be installed in a conventional printing press by degrees and when large editions are being printed a cooler needs to be installed in the oscillationrollers of the press, since an increase in temperature can make the oleophobic parts of the plate oleophilic. The Cortina is however equipped with a temperature controlsystem at the beginning. To avoid picking, caused by the tacky ink, a blanket with a high “quick release” should be used...|$|E
