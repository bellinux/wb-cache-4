5|$|After meeting Tom Cruise {{during the}} filming of Collateral in 2004, Pinkett Smith and Smith donated $20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP), Scientology's basis for homeschooling. The couple came under fire in 2008 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> fund the now-defunct New Village Leadership Academy, a private {{elementary}} school located in Calabasas, California. The school employed teachers dedicated to Scientology and featured controversial methodologies like Study Technology, created by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The couple have denied claims that they are themselves Scientologists, although in 2017 actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has stated that Pinkett Smith {{is a member of}} the Church.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico on 20August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch {{national}} {{he had met}} {{three years}} earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> camp well away from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine {{and the children of}} his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{remained the}} headquarters of Cunard until the 1960s, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> relocate their UK operations to Southampton on England's south coast and their global headquarters to New York. Cunard subsequently sold the building to Prudential plc in 1969. In 1965 the Cunard Building was awarded Grade II* listed building status by the English Heritage. Initially, it was listed together with the Liver Building and Port of Liverpool Building under Pier Head, but in 1985 each building gained its own listing. In November 2001 the building was sold to the Merseyside Pension Fund, an organisation that provides pension services to public sector workers in Merseyside. Today, the building provides a range of office accommodation {{for a variety of}} public and private sector organisations, including Government Office North West. In November 2008 it was announced that the building managers had appointed the local architects firm Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams to draw up a conservation plan to preserve the building. The plan involved collaboration with English Heritage and the Local Authority Conservation Officer and would be used to control any modification and repairs made to the building.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2006, a Philippine Air Force assault {{helicopter}} crashed during {{an emergency landing}} Thursday on the airport's runway. The pilots of the rocket-firing MG520 helicopter, which is used against al-Qaeda-linked militants and communist guerrillas, were on a routine maintenance flight <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make an emergency landing for still-unclear reasons. The MG530 was damaged and its two pilots were slightly injured and shaken by the crash landing.|$|E
25|$|Apart from fission {{induced by}} a neutron, {{harnessed}} and exploited by humans, a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay (not requiring a neutron) is {{also referred to}} as fission, and occurs especially in very high-mass-number isotopes. Spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by Flyorov, Petrzhak and Kurchatov in Moscow, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> confirm that, without bombardment by neutrons, the fission rate of uranium was indeed negligible, as predicted by Niels Bohr; it was not.|$|E

25|$|The CAB, upon {{reviewing}} available weather data, {{determined that}} the Pan Am meteorologist {{should have been able}} to predict, with some amount of certainty, that there would be severe turbulence at lower altitude and high winds. This data would have been available for the meteorologist to make such a prediction prior to or shortly after Flight 923's departure from Seattle. Such a forecast would have warned the crew of the weather conditions they encountered <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> abort their landing at Annette Island airport.|$|E
25|$|Other {{veterans}} {{were arrested}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> approach the communist authorities after being promised amnesty. In 1947, {{the government of}} the People's Republic of Poland proclaimed an amnesty for most of the wartime resistance fighters. The authorities expected around 12,000 people to give up their arms, but the actual number of partisans {{to come out of the}} forests eventually reached 53,000. Many of them were arrested despite promises of freedom; and after repeated broken promises during the first few years of communist rule, former AK members refused to trust the government.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, a tug {{ground unit}} {{properly}} equipped with snow chains {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure would be even further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E

25|$|Minnesotans joined posses {{and set up}} picket lines by the hundreds. After {{several days}} the gang had only reached the western {{outskirts}} of Mankato <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> split up (despite persistent stories to the contrary, Cole Younger told interviewers that they all agreed to the decision). The Youngers and Pitts remained on foot, moving west, until finally they were cornered in a swamp called Hanska Slough, just south of La Salle, Minnesota, on September 21, {{two weeks after the}} Northfield raid. In the gunfight that followed, Pitts was killed and the Youngers were again wounded. The Youngers surrendered and pleaded guilty to murder in order to avoid execution. Frank and Jesse secured horses and fled west across southern Minnesota, turning south just inside the border of the Dakota Territory. In the face of hundreds of pursuers and a nationwide alarm, Frank and Jesse escaped, but the infamous James–Younger Gang was no more.|$|E

Milian {{said that they were}} still really close, and decided to break up because it was [...] "hard to grow together when you live on two different coasts". The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but felt that she was in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|E

500|$|United States Senator Henrik Shipstead {{argued that}} the failure to revise the article became a factor in Hitler's rise to power.

[...] Despite these views, the historical consensus is that the article and the treaty, did not cause the rise of Nazism but that an unconnected rise in extremism and the Great Depression led to the NSDAP gaining greater electoral popularity and then being maneuvered into office. Fritz Klein wrote that while there was a path from Versailles to Hitler, the former did not make [...] "Hitler's takeover of power inevitable" [...] and that [...] "the Germans had a choice <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> take this path.
