5|$|When he {{came upon}} the Meng River, he {{found it to be}} guarded, but crossed anyway and was not stopped; he later stated that he {{believed}} the guards had been asleep. Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations, he eventually passed into less familiar territory; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape. Communicating with a network of activists via a cell phone, he reached a pre-determined rendezvous point where He Peirong, an English teacher and activist, <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> A chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing. Several of the activists reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen's escape.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, {{under the command of}} Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and {{negotiations}} between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E

25|$|Iban Mayo, {{struggling}} the {{day before}} already, had trouble getting up the climbs from the first few meters yet again. He was also extremely annoyed by the cameraman following him and filming his struggle, as that camerman knew Mayo was probably {{going to give up}} and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to do so. In the end Mayo was fined for 200 Swiss Francs for incorrect behaviour in front of the camera. He abandoned when the cameraman stopped following him.|$|E
25|$|Phra Rothasen {{arrived back}} to his city and killed evil Santhumala with a magic club. He then went into the deep dark cave and healed {{the eyes of his}} mother and aunts by putting them back in their place with a special magic ointment. His mother and aunts left their deep cave and regained their former status with the king. They invited him to live in the palace again but Phra Rothasen told them that he had to hurry back to live with Meri who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Prinz Eugen was refuelled, Lütjens {{declined}} {{to top up}} the Bismarck. A rupture {{in one of the}} fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea. The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. Lütjens knew that the German tanker Weissenberg <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes. It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.|$|E

25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he knew that she <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Portusach {{returned}} to Piti where his brother <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and {{was informed that}} the Spanish officers were under arrest, but had been paroled {{with the understanding that}} they would deliver themselves on board the Charleston so they might be taken to Manila as prisoners of war. Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to the Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since it was not necessary to salute the American cruiser.|$|E
25|$|Staying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler {{collected}} {{material for}} his next novel, Thieves in the Night. When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had started to see before going out to Palestine, <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived {{just a few miles from}} the Koestler cottage.|$|E

500|$|On October 1, 1845, Barlow {{and three}} men scouted {{ahead of their}} company and entered Mount Hood's foothills from the east near Tygh Creek, about [...] {{from the mouth of}} the Deschutes River. They came within perhaps [...] of Mount Hood. They thought they had glimpsed the Willamette Valley, and learned from the Indians of a trail leading to Oregon City, but {{returned}} to Tygh Creek about five days after their departure. There Joel Palmer <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> with a 23 wagon party. [...] Palmer had followed Barlow for a better route, and had just returned from exploring the same area. [...] The combined company organized road clearing through the forest, mostly by burning.|$|E
500|$|Ramanujan {{departed}} from Madras aboard the S.S. Nevasa on 17 March 1914. When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> with a car. Four days later, Neville {{took him to}} his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room. Hardy and Littlewood began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan {{in the first two}} letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, [...] "I can believe that he's at least a Jacobi", while Hardy said he [...] "can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward Nikki vanishes {{with the}} cougar (whom she names [...] "Murray"). Loudon visits Mr. Bell to {{apologize}} for losing the animal, to find Nikki had delivered Murray and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at Mr. Bell's home. He has created a Brazilian rainforest filled with animals {{on top of his}} roof. There Nikki and Loudon— who had become close with each other on their journey— express their love for each other, and Murray finds a partner. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki becomes broken-hearted, realizing that she has to go back to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. While on the bus, she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an embezzler and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki gate-crashes the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested and proclaims her love for Loudon. The film ends with Nikki and Loudon riding off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.|$|E

2500|$|Pictures of Baltz {{appeared}} on many front pages {{around the world}} such as the Syracuse Post-Standard, repeating a story from the Associated Press in which he expressed concern about his mother, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at the airport. He gave the only passenger description of the crash: [...] "I heard a big noise while we were flying. The last thing I remember was the plane falling".|$|E
2500|$|A {{white van}} {{that had been}} parked by the {{motorway}} suddenly drove off as Stone fled from the angry crowd. The RUC said the van {{was part of an}} uninvolved police patrol. Stone later claimed that a getaway vehicle, driven by a UDA member, <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on the motorway but the driver [...] "panicked" [...] and left. By the time Stone reached the motorway, he had seemingly run out of ammunition. He ran out onto the road and tried to stop cars, but was caught by the crowd and beaten unconscious. RUC officers quickly arrived, [...] "almost certainly saving his life". They arrested him and took him to Musgrave Park Hospital for treatment of his injuries. The whole event had been recorded by television news cameras.|$|E
2500|$|On November 14, 1882, Frank Leslie became {{involved}} in an argument with Billy Claiborne who, after the recent death of William Bonney, had demanded {{to be known as}} [...] "Billy the Kid". Claiborne claimed he had killed three men who had ridiculed him, although there is only evidence of Claiborne 's fight with Bill Hickey. But he had run from the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and his reputation suffered as a result. On this late night, Claiborne threatened Leslie. When Leslie still refused to refer to him as [...] "Billy the Kid", Claiborne left, only to return later that night. A patron told Leslie that Claiborne <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> outside the Oriental Saloon. [...] Leslie walked out a side door and when Claiborne shot at him, he shot back, killing him. Because [...] Claiborne was waiting outside to ambush Leslie and fired first, the killing was ruled justified. It was described as [...] "an incident that became an open-and-closed affair over the short period of time required by Frank to puff through a rolled cylinder of Bull Durham." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 17, 2016, Bermúdez Zacarías went on {{a morning}} jog nearby his home in Metepec, an upscale exurb [...] outside of Mexico City. As he was {{crossing}} a side {{street in front of}} a private residential neighborhood entrance, a man dressed in black ran up to him from behind and shot him at point-blank range {{in the head with a}} 9 mm pistol. Bermúdez Zacarías was able to turn his head briefly before the gunman delivered the shot in the back of his head. The judge fell to the ground bleeding and curled into fetal position before rolling on his back and spreading his legs and arms. The assassin then ran back and startled a cyclist and a pedestrian before catching up with his accomplice, who <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> from a distance, before fleeing the scene. While Bermúdez Zacarías was on the ground, a car stopped next to him for a few seconds before continuing its course. A second vehicle turned towards the street Bermúdez Zacarías was on, but continued driving inside the residential neighborhood after stopping momentarily. The security guards from the residential neighborhood then called an ambulance. He was transported to Regional Hospital 251 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Metepec, but doctors confirmed that he died before reaching the hospital. The murder scene was cordoned by the Metepec municipal police, the State of Mexico police, and members of the State of Mexico Attorney General Office. All three law enforcement agencies conducted an investigation at the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was gunned down.|$|E
