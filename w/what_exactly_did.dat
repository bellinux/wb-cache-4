40|$|The prison has {{a global}} history. The {{emergence}} of the modern state and, at least in Europe and the United States, the expansion of political rights involved a transformation of penal systems. At the centre of this development was the prison which evolved from a means of detention into the principal instrument of sanction. Between the early {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century, imprisonment became the dominant form of punishment on a worldwide scale. But <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> this mean? And how can we explain this far-reaching transformation of penal systems? Existing research on the modern prison in Europe, the United States, Latin America, Asia and Africa notwithstanding, very basic questions about the prison as a global phenomenon remain unanswered. How and why did the prison succeed as the prevalent form of punishment around the globe? <b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> “global” mean, considering the often immense diversity of existing penal regimes not only between but also within empires, nation states and colonies? And what do we actually refer to when {{we are talking about the}} prison, given the wide variety of institutions of confinement and penal regimes all over the world? How was the development of the prison interwoven with and separated from other forms of punishment? To what extent and in which ways were the transformations of penal regimes throughout the world interconnected with each other? What was the actual significance of cross-border transfers of knowledge about criminality and punishment for these local processes? How multidirectional were the knowledge transfers within and between continents? And, finally, how do we have to think about decentring the history of the prison in a global context? Forty years after the publication of Michel Foucault’s seminal work Discipline and Punish, it can be argued that the integration of the history of the prison into the perspectives of global history remains the last discernible promise for a fundamental innovation in the field...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} Alypius' road to Christianity is being scrutinized. This first part {{examines}} Alypius' conversion moment - recounted in Conf. VIII. xii(30) - in great detail. The central {{question here is}} : to <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> Alypius believe he converted in that fateful garden of Milan together with his dear friend Augustine? A close analysis of his conversion passage suggests that he decided there and then to become an ascetic christianus as well, but that this not automatically involved baptism, while Augustine's mind was already set on baptism at his conversion. The story of Victorinus' conversion may have {{played an important role}} in this difference, since only Augustine heard this story from Simplicianus. Other indications, such as his strong inner virtue and his classical outlook on life, can explain why initially Alypius preferred a less committed place within the catholica ecclesia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{trend of}} innovation seems to characterize Sanskrit Poetics {{on the eve}} of colonialism. Like intellectuals in other Sanskritic disci-plines, ālam. kārikas – from about mid sixteenth-century onward – adopted a new discursive idiom, composed in novel genres, demon-strated a fresh interest in the history of their tradition, and worked across disciplines at a hitherto unknown rate. Moreover, they often had a clear sense of themselves as breaking new ground and were thus conceived by their colleagues. But of <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> their innovations consist? The new poeticians may have identified themselves and their fellows as new (navya) in contrast to their antecedents (prācı̄na), an act which, as Sheldon Pollock puts it, “appears to signify not just a different relationship with the past but a different way of thinking. ” 1 Yet they seldom presented their theories as innovative, let alone as general theoretical breakthroughs, and mostly worked from within the conceptual frameworks of their predecessors.

40|$|Sixteenth-century English Protestants {{struggled}} with the legacy left them by the Lutheran reformation: a strict disjunction between inward and outward that hindered {{the development of a}} robust theology of worship. For Luther, outward forms of worship {{had more to do with}} the edification of the neighbour than they did with pleasing God. But <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> ‘edification’ mean? On the one hand, English Protestants sought to avoid the Roman Catholic view that certain elements of worship held an intrinsic spiritual value; on the other hand, many did not want to imply that forms of worship were spiritually arbitrary and had a merely civil value. Richard Hooker developed his theology of worship in response to this challenge, seeking to maintain a clear distinction between the inward worship of the heart and the outward forms of public worship, while refusing to disassociate the two. The result was a concept of edification which sought to do justice to both civil and spiritual concerns, without, pace Peter Lake and other scholars, conceding an inch to a Catholic theology of worshi...|$|E

40|$|To {{account for}} a {{perceived}} distinction {{it is necessary to}} postulate a real distinction. Our process of experiencing the world is one of, mostly unconscious, interpretation of observed distinctions to provide us with a partial world-picture that is sufficient to guide action. The distinctions, themselves, are acorrigible (they do not have a truth value), directly perceived, structured, and capable of being interpreted. Interpreted experience is corrigible, representational and capable of guiding action. Since interpretation is carried out mostly unconsciously and in real time, the two aspects are present in experience together so {{that it is difficult to}} separate them out. 2.

40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{progressive}} “colonization” of vast, sparsely populated territories became a political imperative {{in the last ten}} years of the Tsarist Empire. By the eve of World War I, there was a sizable literature on “resettlement” (pereselenie) and “colonization” (kolonizatsiia), a body of knowledge built up over time through careful study of foreign models. It comprised theoretical treatises, manuals, and specialized periodicals. In 1914, an authoritative semi-official publication proclaimed that the “lands of Asiatic Russia are an indivisible and inseparable part of our state and at the same time our only colony. ” How did this terminology become part of the imperial lexicon? <b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> Russian authors mean by “colonization” and what nuances did the meaning of the word acquire in the decades before the revolution? This article explores the colonization discourse articulated by Russia’s intellectual and administrative elite, including unofficial and oppositionist components.

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>did</b> Britain 's Aristocracy Contribute to Agricultural Progress from 1688 to 1789 ? Historians {{seem to be}} {{in broad}} {{agreement}} that, in their capacity as owners and managers of a very considerable and probably increasing share of their country's cultivable land, Britain 's aristocracy made a far greater contribution to agricultural progress over the 18 th century than the aristocracies of continental Europe. This bibliographical survey of recent research in British agrarian history suggests that agricultural growth from 1688 to 1789 had only limited connexions with the steps taken by the larger aristocratie landowners to enclose their estates, to consolidate land into larger farms, to diffuse better techniques of cultivation—by shortening leases and inserting covenants of an improving kind into the contracts their stewards made with farmers for the use of land. Furthermore, the proportions of their rents reinvested in agriculture were on the available evidence pretty paltry. Basically what the aristocracy did, with style, was to make agriculture fashionable and to preside over the work foresight and innovations of Britain 's farmers and smaller gentry. O'Brien Patrick K.
