25|$|Just to make sure: I do {{not think}} that any of the above is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their {{articles}} and how this led them to their conclusions.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
60|$|MRS. MILER. [With another sudden sniff] Gawd knows I don't want {{to upset}} ye. You're {{situated}} very hard; an' women's got no business to 'urt one another--that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Plantagenet, <b>what</b> can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of it but}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have expressed, {{that it is a}} {{wonderful}} event, but the happiest in my life.' ...|$|R

25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped {{to a low of}} just 19percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is right for the United States based upon principles. I frankly don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I do better than anybody".|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think nothin'," [...] said she. [...] "Just {{as soon as}} I {{begin to}} look at them wrigglin' in the wind, and I am beginnin' to wonder <b>what</b> it is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about them, <b>I</b> go slam bang to sleep, and when I wake up and try to think again <b>what</b> it is <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> off <b>I</b> go again. But I like it. If <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> it is <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> ought to know that I don't know it. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call bein' really and truly a hermick." ...|$|R

500|$|The title [...] "The Holy Bible" [...] {{was chosen}} by Edwards to reflect an idea, {{according}} to Bradfield, that [...] "everything on {{there has to be}} perfection". Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: [...] "The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the way the world is and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my lyrics are about. [...] doesn't pretend things don't exist".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Rob Thomas, was {{not content}} with the kiss scene, writing {{that it was not}} how he envisioned it. [...] "I wasn't {{actually}} pleased with the first Veronica/Logan kiss. Now, I may have been wrong on this front, but it wasn't what I imagined, or really <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was described in the script. The line of description called for Logan to [...] "devour" [...] Veronica. I wanted it to be—I don't know if sexual is the right word, but—hungry, or a release, or mixed with some self-loathing and confusion. Instead, it came off as singularly romantic." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before rehearsals {{began in}} January 1951, Rodgers {{had the first}} Tuptim, Doretta Morrow, sing the entire score to Lawrence, {{including}} Lawrence's own songs. [...] Lawrence listened calmly, but when she met Rodgers and Hammerstein the following day, she treated Rodgers coldly, apparently seeing the composer's actions as flaunting her vocal deficiencies. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence could handle the part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. [...] James Poling, a writer for Collier's who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing [...] "Shall I Tell You <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> of You?": ...|$|E
6000|$|DOOLITTLE. Musical instrument, Governor. A few pictures, {{a trifle}} of jewelry, and a bird-cage. She said she didn't want no clothes. <b>What</b> was <b>I</b> to <b>think</b> from that, Governor? I ask {{you as a}} parent <b>what</b> was <b>I</b> to <b>think?</b> ...|$|R

6000|$|POULDER. Ah! That [...] "Purity an' Future o' the Race Campaign." [...] I'll {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> the danger o' that, Miss. So much purity that there won't be a future race. [Expanding] Purity of 'eart's an {{excellent}} thing, no doubt, but there's a want of nature about it. Same with this Anti-Sweating. Unless you're anxious to come down, {{you must not}} put the lower classes up.|$|R
500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose is getting thinner every six months. His lips are getting thinner. His eyebrows are getting higher. His eyes are getting wider every time. His cheekbones are getting bigger." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1980 Sellers {{asked his}} fifteen-year-old {{daughter}} Victoria {{what she thought}} about Being There: she reported later that, [...] "I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, 'You looked like a little fat old man'.... he went mad. He threw his drink over {{me and told me}} to get the next plane home." [...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{were his}} mother <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> can {{put myself in}} her place--I'm not narrow-minded. I know {{perfectly}} well how she must regard such a question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may <b>think</b> after dinner," [...] returns Mr. Jobling, [...] "is one thing, my dear Guppy, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may <b>think</b> {{before dinner}} is another thing. Still, even after dinner, I ask myself the question, <b>What</b> am <b>I</b> to do? How am I to live? Ill fo manger, you know," [...] says Mr. Jobling, pronouncing that word {{as if he}} meant a {{necessary}} fixture in an English stable. [...] "Ill fo manger. That's the French saying, and mangering is as necessary to me {{as it is to}} a Frenchman. Or more so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please wait. <b>What</b> could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{when you}} told me? I was at the {{settlement}} that morning, and saw your cut lips when you stood on the verandah." ...|$|R
500|$|On 6July, they {{received}} {{a set of rules}} from Parliament and were ordered to examine the first ten of the Thirty-Nine Articles, the current doctrinal standard of the Church of England, and [...] "to free and vindicate the Doctrine of them from all Aspersions of false Interpretations". After a day of fasting, the Assembly took a vow, as directed by Parliament, to [...] "not maintain any thing in Matters of Doctrine, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in my conscience, to be truth". The divines organized themselves into three standing committees, though each committee was open to any member of the Assembly. The committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full Assembly following each morning of committee meetings. In addition, over 200 ad hoc committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers, college fellows, and suspected heretics.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{landed in}} Dieppe, {{and made his}} way to Paris via Rouen. Although he {{admitted}} to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that [...] "I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year. If I don't, I shall content myself with seeing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> worth while; and then return." [...] He travelled onwards via Geneva, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in Florence.|$|E
500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do <b>think.</b> See, {{the flame}} is growing brighter. Either it's the cabin or that cattle shed {{he has been}} building. Come on; we'll soon know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why do {{you want}} my advice, if you've made up your mind to that? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you're quite right; and <b>what's</b> more, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you ought to lose no time in doing it. Will she go, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} <b>what,</b> Capataz? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that when the}} time comes and some {{information}} must be given, I shall indicate the Great Isabel. That is the best place <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of. <b>What</b> is the matter?" ...|$|R
500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but you know <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is a better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera {{was chosen as the}} featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|Cultura Profética {{has been}} {{described}} as roots reggae. The group has often made use of the moog synthesizer, an instrument commonly used in traditional reggae but is generally rare in contemporary reggae. Despite primarily performing reggae music, the group incorporates various other rhythms into its compositions, including those of Caribbean genres such as salsa. The song [...] "Reggae Rústico" [...] from Ideas Nuevas includes an extended soneo, an improvised call-and-response section common in the salsa genre, at its closing, calling for unity in reggae music. Additionally, the band's music features a strong emphasis on improvisation and polyrhythmic patterns. Rodríguez notes that [...] "We've developed <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is our own genre. We don't consider ourselves a pop act but we do make popular music {{in the sense that we}} are supported by many people. People have finally understood what we do." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard observed elements of jazz in the single [...] "La Complicidad," [...] additionally describing it as [...] "more mellow rock than reggae." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1899, that {{prediction}} suddenly came true. At {{the age of}} forty-two, Elgar {{produced the}} Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, [...] "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... {{that is to say}} I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they would have written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work [...] "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is [...] "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the divided {{contemporary}} response, Middlemarch gained immediate admirers; in 1873, the poet Emily Dickinson expressed high praise for the novel, exclaiming {{in a letter to}} a friend: [...] "What do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Middlemarch? <b>What</b> do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of glory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we may {{throw them}} from us, though," [...] said Bucklaw, [...] "and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> of doing {{one of these}} days--that is, when old Lady Girnington dies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith!" [...] said Rowland, {{although}} his acquaintance with Mr. Wilding was slight and recent. [...] "It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> He {{does not look}} like a man familiar with fear." ...|$|R
