5|$|The Uncle Grandpa short that Browngardt had {{produced}} was eventually adapted {{as a full}} series of the same name, which he felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> lighthearted adaptation for children.|$|E
5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in {{the works}} for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to replicate the period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E
5|$|A band {{formed by}} the American musicians Thomas Jude on guitars, Paul Morris on keyboards, Nick Douglas on bass and Tom Coombs on drums was {{assembled}} for the supporting tour. Doro <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> commercial offering than the previous album, but resulted in a flop in the US. On the contrary, it sold well in Europe, accelerating PolyGram's decision to interrupt the publication of Doro's albums in America, where the commercial appeal of glam metal and classic rock acts was rapidly declining in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Doro concluded 1990 playing some dates in Germany, opening for Scorpions.|$|E

25|$|In most armies {{the rank}} of {{sergeant}} corresponds to command of a squad (or section). In Commonwealth armies, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> senior rank, corresponding roughly to a platoon second-in-command.

5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 {{copies of the}} recording were produced in total.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

50|$|The {{characters}} of Paco Román and Eduardo Rusca, who <b>were</b> portrayed in <b>a</b> character triptych with Luna in the film, were written to be polar opposites. Román would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> controlled, logical character who would help bring out <b>a</b> <b>more</b> controlled side of Luna, while Rusca would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> passionate character who could provide moments of levity throughout the film.|$|R

5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E
5|$|In late 1982, Atari ported Pac-Man {{to its new}} console, the Atari 5200. This version <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{accurate}} {{conversion of}} the original arcade game and was a launch title for the console, along with eleven other games. The port was also followed by conversions of Pac-Mans arcade sequels, Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man, for the Atari 2600. Both were better received than Atari's first Pac-Man title and addressed many critics' complaints of Pac-Man, but {{at the cost of}} excluding a two-player mode and requiring larger ROM cartridges.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Mardersteig {{developed}} {{plans for}} a second design, Dante, which was again cut by Malin slowly from 1946 onwards but taken also up by Monotype. Monotype Dante Series 592, Dante Semi Bold Series 682 and Dante Titling Series 612, were only produced in Didot-sizes. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> eccentric revival of the Aldine face than Bembo, it did not attract as much popularity.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Näslund {{was drafted}} 16th {{overall in the}} 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The team's general manager, Craig Patrick, hailed Näslund and Forsberg as the draft's top two {{prospects}} behind first-overall selection Eric Lindros. He compared Näslund to the Los Angeles Kings' Swedish forward Tomas Sandström, {{although he did not}} consider him as aggressive a player, and further claimed that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> natural goal-scorer than Penguins forward Jaromír Jágr, who had just completed his rookie year with the club.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E

5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on.

He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|On-farm {{factories}} in the Deloraine area made cheese, mostly cheddar, during the early 20th century. Cheese {{was made in the}} Meander area from at least 1908 when a factory opened on the Cheshunt estate. The last of the area's factories closed prior to World War II. Meander had a resident blacksmith from c.1876, though blacksmithing had been done on private properties before this. Blacksmithing as a separate industry continued into the early 20th century. Prompted by new legislation in the 1980s, that enforced hygiene standards in animal slaughtering, a slaughter-house was opened in Meander. It was registered in 1986. Before this butchering <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> informal or back-yard industry.|$|E
5|$|Social {{divisions}} {{did appear}} both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and {{society of the}} north had modernized more slowly {{than those of the}} south, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> pronounced conflict between Christianity and socialism in the north, and farmland had a major social status; ownership of even a small parcel of land created a motivation to fight against the Reds.|$|E

5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which spanned the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> direct route for {{the flow of}} traffic across the river; particularly for trucks and heavy vehicles from the industrial area. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 and closed in 2009 due to deterioration. The bridge was demolished by Joseph B. Fay Co. on February 21, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> effective light machine gun.|$|E
