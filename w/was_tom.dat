5|$|Liverpool {{have had}} 21 {{full-time}} managers. Kenny Dalglish {{is the only}} person to have managed the club on two separate occasions. He first managed Liverpool from 1985 to February 1991, and then from January 2011 to July 2012. The most successful person to manage Liverpool is Bob Paisley, who won six Football League titles, five Charity Shields, three Football League Cups, three European Cups, one UEFA Super Cup and one UEFA Cup in his nine-year reign as manager. The club's longest-serving manager <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Watson, who managed the club from 1896 to 1915, totalling 19 years.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{taste for}} {{adventure}} did not diminish {{in his last}} years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst's newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which Walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII's election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book Roman Fountain, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.|$|E

5|$|World War II meant The Football League was {{suspended}} for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53. However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{finished}} third in the 2012–13 season to book a place in the play-offs. They won 3–1 against Witton Albion in the semi-final, but lost the final for the third consecutive time with a 1–2 defeat to Hednesford Town. The following season, the club finished second in the league but lost in the play-offs in the semi-finals. During the 2014–15 campaign, F.C. United reached the fourth round of the FA Trophy and recorded a streak of 21 league games without a loss from December to April, including 16 victories. They secured their promotion to the National League North following a 1–0 win against Stourbridge on 21 April 2015; after seven years of trying. The club's top scorer for this championship winning season <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Greaves, the same player who scored the winning goal for Bradford Park Avenue against F.C. United in the 2012 play-off final.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to jump in and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par. In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to create a more technologically advanced game. As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.|$|E
5|$|William Edward Burghardt Du Bois {{was born}} on February 23, 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to Alfred and Mary Silvina (née Burghardt) Du Bois. Mary Silvina Burghardt's family {{was part of the}} very small free black {{population}} of Great Barrington and had long owned land in the state. She was descended from Dutch, African and English ancestors. William Du Bois's maternal great-great-grandfather <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Burghardt, a slave (born in West Africa around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, which may have been how he gained his freedom during the 18th century. His son Jack Burghardt was the father of Othello Burghardt, who was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.|$|E
5|$|As the 1936 season began, Hammond {{remained}} weak {{from the}} recent removal of his tonsils. Returning to cricket too soon, he was in poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss {{the first of three}} Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by Wisden for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Goddard's benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 {{out of a total of}} 485.|$|E

5|$|York's first {{match in}} the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and {{finished}} with a 2–0 victory for the visitors. Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match {{at the age of}} 15 years and 281 days. The 1929–30 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and George Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931–32, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of £1,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2–2 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground <b>was</b> <b>Tom</b> Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932–33, finishing in 20th place. The club only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of the season.|$|E
