5|$|Edward-Rhys Harry reconstructed Parry's {{setting of}} the Te Deum taken from the text of The Book of Common Prayer. The {{manuscript}} was discovered in the National Library of Wales archives. Parry wrote the manuscript in 1863, while living in Danville. Harry uncovered the manuscript while researching choral traditions at the library. He worked a year at transcribing the original Parry manuscript. The London Welsh Chorale gave the <b>work</b> <b>its</b> world première performance under Harry at StGiles Cripplegate, Barbican, London on 14 July 2012.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} authorship of the <b>work,</b> <b>its</b> actual date, and its purpose, {{have long been}} matters for {{controversy}} amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include {{the nature of the}} sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Postier Bretons were {{developed}} {{as a result of}} crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century.

The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery, and it {{has been described as a}} lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished <b>work,</b> <b>its</b> use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF {{recognized}} the Czech Republic as {{the successor to}} Czechoslovakia, allowing the team to retain {{its position in the}} top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> way up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia, who later lost to Finland in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime play with a 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored {{one of the most famous}} goals in Olympic history by faking a forehand shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch. Canada's final shooter Paul Kariya's shot was saved by Tommy Salo and Sweden won the game and its first gold medal.|$|E

5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} up the river, {{sometimes}} in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching {{under the cover of}} the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain and stiff defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had {{to be dealt with}} individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> way around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were overwhelmed and many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E
5|$|Hotel Chevalier is an American-French {{short film}} written and {{directed}} by Wes Anderson and released in 2007. Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature The Darjeeling Limited. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone <b>work.</b> <b>Its</b> first showing was at the Venice Film Festival première of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{realised}} {{that the}} direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed. Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but {{he was forced to}} burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet. Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates. By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly <b>work</b> <b>its</b> way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory <b>work,</b> <b>its</b> basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration <b>work.</b> <b>Its</b> place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E

5|$|The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (SNAE), 1902–04, was {{organised}} {{and led by}} William Speirs Bruce, {{a natural}} scientist and former medical student from the University of Edinburgh. Although overshadowed in prestige terms by Robert Falcon Scott's concurrent Discovery Expedition, the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific <b>work.</b> <b>Its</b> achievements included {{the establishment of a}} manned meteorological station, the first in Antarctic territory, and the discovery of new land to the east of the Weddell Sea. Its large collection of biological and geological specimens, together with those from Bruce's earlier travels, led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his <b>work</b> <b>its</b> particular characteristic.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{carried out}} its own day-to-day maintenance in Malaya; the Lincolns were rotated back to Australia for major <b>work.</b> <b>Its</b> original complement of six aircraft was increased to eight after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent {{withdrawal of the}} RAF's Lincolns to Bomber Command in Europe. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in 1950–51 and 1954–55. It suffered no casualties during the campaign but two of its aircraft were written off: one that overshot the landing strip at Tengah in November 1951, and another that crashed into the sea off Johore after striking trees on takeoff in January 1957.|$|E
