25|$|No {{person may}} be {{detained}} for enquiries for more than 24 hours unless such detention is authorized by a police officer of or above the rank of assistant superintendent, or for 48 hours in all. Such a police officer may, if satisfied that the enquiries cannot be completed within 48 hours, authorize the further detention of the person for an additional period not exceeding 14 days. In contrast, under Article 9(3) of the Constitution of Singapore, {{a person who is}} arrested must be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. In addition, Article 9(4) states that he must <b>without</b> <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay,</b> and in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), be produced before a magistrate and shall not be further detained in custody without the magistrate's authority. However, the Constitution specifically provides that no law inconsistent with those provisions which was in force before the commencement of the Constitution and which authorizes the arrest and detention of any person in the interests of public safety, peace and good order is invalidated by these Articles. No illegality in the detention by the police renders a detention order made subsequently by the Minister unlawful.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} this futile {{interview}} upon Lady Harman was remarkable. She took to herself an absurd conviction that this inconclusiveness had been an achievement. Confronted by a dilemma, she had chosen neither horn and assumed an attitude of inoffensive defiance. Springs in England vary greatly in their character; some are easterly and quarrelsome, some are north-westerly and wetly disastrous, a bleak invasion from the ocean; some are but the broken beginnings of what {{are not so much}} years as stretches of meteorological indecision. This particular spring was essentially a south-westerly spring, good and friendly, showery but in the lightest way and so softly reassuring as to be gently hilarious. It was a spring to get into the blood of anyone; it gave Lady Harman the feeling that Mrs. Pembrose would certainly be dealt with properly and <b>without</b> <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> by Heaven, and that meanwhile it was well to take the good things of existence as cheerfully as possible. The good things she took were very innocent things. Feeling unusually well and enjoying great draughts of spring air and sunshine were the chief. And she took them only for three brief days. She carried the children down to Black Strand to see her daffodils, and her daffodils surpassed expectation. There was a delirium of blackthorn in the new wild garden she had annexed from the woods and a close carpet of encouraged wild primroses. Even the Putney garden was full of happy surprises. The afternoon following her visit to Black Strand was so warm that she had tea with her family in great gaiety on the lawn under the cedar. Her offspring were unusually sweet that day, they had new blue cotton sunbonnets, and Baby and Annette at least succeeded in being pretty. And Millicent, under the new Swiss governess, had acquired, it seemed quite suddenly, a glib colloquial French that somehow reconciled one to the extreme thinness and shapelessness of her legs.|$|E

40|$|JUDGES. LIMITING IMMUNITY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Eliminates {{immunity}} from civil liability of state judges, magistrates, commissioners, arbitrators, and judicial mediators, for deliberate violations of law, fraud, conspiracy, intentional violation {{of due process}} of law, deliberate disregard of material facts, judicial acts <b>without</b> jurisdiction, <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> of a case, or deliberate constitutional violations. Establishes three twenty-five member Special Grand Juries empowered to: indict and, through a special trial jury, convict and sentence a judge for criminal conduct; determine if a judge may invoke judicial immunity in a civil suit; and permanently remove a judge who receives three adverse immunity decisions. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: This measure will result in costs {{to the state of}} about $ 17 million for the operation of special grand juries. These costs could be partially to fully offset by a number of sources specified in the measure. To the extent that the measure results in additional civil cases being filed against judges in court, the measure could also result in unknown additional costs to the state for support of the courts...|$|R

50|$|Shared buses or vans are {{available}} in many more developed countries connecting frequent destinations, charging a fixed fee per passenger. The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations. These services are often known as shuttles. Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses, and often operate on demand. An air traveller can contact the shuttle company by telephone or Internet, not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided <b>without</b> <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay.</b> The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city. The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although taking longer, at a price which is significantly lower {{for one or two}} passengers. Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles.|$|E

They provide that where a certificate has been given under s26B by a generic manufacturer and the patent holder wishes to claim a patent and institute infringement proceedings, he or she must first certify that the proceedings are being commenced in good faith, have reasonable prospects of success (as defined in s26C(4)) and will be conducted <b>without</b> <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay.</b> If the certificate is found to be false or midleading, fines of up to $10 million apply and the Cth Attorney General is permitted to join the action to recoup losses to the PBS.

5000|$|To sum up, in my judgment, the Restricted Residence Enactment {{is silent}} {{as regards the}} four rights {{guaranteed}} by article 5 to a person arrested under the Enactment, namely, {{the right to be}} informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest, to be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice, and, if not sooner released, to be produced <b>without</b> <b>unreasonable</b> <b>delay</b> and in any case within 24 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey), before a magistrate and not to be further detained without the magistrate’s order. Such further detention must be in accordance with law, which law need not give him a right to an enquiry. Silence of the Enactment regarding the four rights does not make it contrary to the constitution. Even if the Enactment is contrary to the Constitution, the Enactment is not void. The four rights should be read into the Enactment.|$|E
