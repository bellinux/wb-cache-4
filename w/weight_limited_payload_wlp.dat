5|$|Early 20th-century <b>weight</b> <b>limits</b> were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck <b>weight</b> <b>limits</b> focused {{primarily}} on gross <b>weight</b> <b>limits</b> (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck <b>weight</b> <b>limits.</b> The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|R
