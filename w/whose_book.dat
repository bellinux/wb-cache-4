5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection.

5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, <b>whose</b> <b>book</b> published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

25|$|Because {{ethology}} {{is considered}} a topic of biology, ethologists have been concerned particularly with the evolution of behaviour and the understanding of behaviour {{in terms of the}} theory of natural selection.

25|$|Haggard also owed a {{considerable}} debt to Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer <b>whose</b> <b>book</b> Through Masai Land {{was a hit}} in January 1885.

Contemporary James Runciman wrote an article entitled King Plagiarism and His Court, interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this. Thomson was so outraged at Haggard's alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, Ulu: an African Romance, which, however, failed to sell.|$|E

25|$|Guderian's {{leadership}} was supported, fostered and institutionalised by his {{supporters in the}} Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 1930s. Guderian's book incorporated the work of theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, <b>whose</b> <b>book,</b> The Tank War (Der Kampfwagenkrieg) (1934) gained a wide audience in the German army.

25|$|Those {{focused on}} working {{conditions}} included Friedrich Engels, <b>whose</b> <b>book</b> The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, Karl Marx. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 {{to help improve}} the condition of workers by limiting work hours {{and the use of}} child labor. The formation of the International Labour Organization in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the Progressive Era in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, passed during the New Deal.|$|E
