5|$|Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm, notwithstanding, {{shared a}} {{harmonious}} marriage. The Electress spent her time enjoying balls, musical performances and other festivities. He commissioned a theatre for her where the comedies of French playwright Molière were performed. Because Anna Maria Luisa patronised many musicians, the contemporary Palatine court enjoyed regard {{as an international}} centre of music. She invited Fortunato Chelleri to court and appointed him maestro di cappella ("music teacher"). Agostino Steffani, a polymath, <b>was</b> <b>sponsored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Electress from his arrival in Düsseldorf, in 1703, until her return to Tuscany; the Conservatorio library in Florence houses two editions of his chamber duets.|$|E

5|$|Librarians at Valley Library {{began using}} text {{messaging}} in March 2010 {{to communicate with}} some library patrons, and earlier started to loan out Amazon's Kindle reader. In April, the school started allowing students to use the library 24-hours-a-day from Sunday through Thursday to test whether there was enough demand to allow 24-hour access on a permanent basis. The program <b>was</b> <b>sponsored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Associated Students of Oregon State University and paid for by university technology funds, and was {{due in part to}} the closure of some computer labs that had been 24-hour study areas.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project <b>was</b> <b>sponsored</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
