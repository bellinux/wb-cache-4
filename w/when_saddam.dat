5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, British Secretary of State for Defence Tom King soon {{announced}} that the UK military contribution to the region was to be increased. A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it went, and then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions {{in preparation for the}} main amphibious landing force.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{he flew to}} Baghdad {{to attempt}} to {{negotiate}} the release of aircraft passengers and other British nationals taken hostage <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein invaded Kuwait. After the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, he stated in the House of Commons that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, the Iraqi Special Tribunal {{announced}} that Saddam Hussein and six co-defendants would face trial on 21 August 2006, {{in relation to}} the Anfal campaign. In December 2006 Saddam was put on trial for the genocide during Operation Anfal. The trial for the Anfal campaign was still underway on 30 December 2006, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was executed {{for his role in the}} unrelated Dujail Massacre.|$|E
50|$|Iraq-Saudi {{relations}} are {{the relations between}} the Republic of Iraq and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Under Saddam Hussein, relations were manageable, especially after the Iraq-Iran War began in 1980. These manageable relations were soon quelled at the Gulf War, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to international sanctions on Iraq and a significant deterioration in Iraqi-Saudi relations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam's</b> uncle, Khairallah Talfah, was {{discovered}} to be terminally ill, the Israelis investigated {{the possibility of}} using a commando team to ambush the funeral party. A commando team from the Israeli Army's elite Sayeret Matkal special forces unit was to be inserted into Iraq from Jordan, where they would travel to the funeral near Tikrit and kill Saddam with TV-guided [...] "Midras" [...] missiles.|$|R
50|$|After {{his arrest}} and release in Italy in 1989, Van Anraat fled to Iraq, {{where he lived}} for the next 14 years. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime fell in 2003, Van Anraat {{returned}} to the Netherlands. He was arrested on December 6, 2004 for complicity in war crimes and genocide. On December 23, 2005, {{he was sentenced to}} fifteen years in prison for complicity in war crimes, but the court decided the charges of complicity in genocide could not be substantiated.|$|R
25|$|Iraq {{had been}} {{listed as a}} State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein invaded Kuwait. Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had {{proven to be a}} problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein rose to power, {{things began}} to change for the Assyrians in Iraq. Assyrians were {{deprived}} of their cultural and national rights {{while at the same}} time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. The 1972 proclamation was reversed and Hussein began a strict campaign of Arabization on any non-Arabs in Iraq, including Assyrians as well as other groups such as Kurds, Iraqi Turkmen, and Armenians. During the Iran–Iraq War, many Assyrians were recruited to the armies of both sides. This resulted in Assyrians in Iraq killing Assyrians in Iran. It was estimated that 60,000 Assyrians were killed during the conflict.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the project {{concerned}} the translation of historical documents related to the events that happened in Halabja, Iraq within Kurdistan on 16 March 1988, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein’s regime bombed the entire district with chemical weapons in the closing days of the Iran–Iraq War, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 5,000 Kurds. The attack on Halabja has been well-documented as being the single most brutal attack of Saddam Hussein’s reign, as well as the deadliest chemical weapons attack against a civilian population {{in the history of the}} world. Today, many of the living Kurdish civilians affected by the chemical attack still suffer from various illnesses both psychological and physical, in addition to the birth defects of their progeny.|$|E
50|$|The {{power of}} the al-Bu Nasir and their tribal allies reached its zenith in the 1990s, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime was under great strain {{from the effects of}} {{international}} sanctions. Tribal chiefs were given extensive patronage, money and weapons as well as membership of the national assembly as a means of binding them to the regime. The old Ba'ath Party structures were to some extent sidelined in favour of an explicitly tribal power structure centred on the al-Bu Nasir. However, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein greatly reduced the influence of the al-Bu Nasir in the new Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the past}} Totten has {{described}} himself as a [...] "weird combination of liberal, libertarian, and neocon" [...] and later he {{described himself as}} politically centrist. He initially supported the Iraq War, stating during the run-up, [...] "If you don’t join us now, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam’s</b> regime falls and Iraqis cheer the US Marines, you are really going to feel like a jackass. And your jackassery will be exposed beneath klieg lights for all to see." [...] However, he believed that the critics of the war who noted the lack of progress from 2004 to 2006 were correct while the Bush administration was wrong. He supported the 2007 'surge' strategy.|$|R
5000|$|The Soumar (Persian: سومار) is an Iranian {{long-range}} cruise missile. The missile {{was named}} in the honour of a village called Soumar, whose inhabitants were all killed <b>when</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime attacked the village with chemical weapons. It is highly likely that the missile {{is derived from the}} Russian Kh-55, several of which were illegally sold to Iran by Ukraine in 2005. According to Jonathan Ruhe and Blake Fleisher from the Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy, nuclear capable cruise missiles, such as the Soumar, were overlooked in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear program and UN Security Council Resolution 2231.|$|R
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{suppressed}} Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, {{with the}} Red Cross, {{set up the}} charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign {{on behalf of the}} Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed for free. Archer claimed that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later revealed that only £3 million came from the Simple Truth concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later result in further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.|$|E
25|$|In Arab culture, {{showing the}} sole of one's shoe is {{considered}} an insult, and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult. Shoes {{are considered to be}} dirty as they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest part of the body— the foot. As such, shoes are forbidden in mosques, and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to someone when talking to them. This insult was demonstrated in Iraq, first <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes. Secondly, in 2008, United States President George W. Bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to Iraq and the lives that it has cost. More generally, shoe-throwing or shoeing, showing {{the sole of}} one's shoe or using shoes to insult are forms of protest {{in many parts of the}} world. Incidents where shoes were thrown at political figures have taken place in Australia, India, Ireland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and most notably the Arab world.|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 1994, in {{response}} to renewed Iraqi deployment of troops near the Kuwaiti border, the US-led Operation Vigilant Warrior began. The operation was designed to deter Saddam's [...] "" [...] by sending large amounts of allied military forces to Kuwait; [...] and Cardiff were the UK contribution. The operation ended on 21 December 1994, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> pulled back his forces.|$|E
50|$|According to the Pentagon, 250000 ST (of 650000 ST total) of {{ordnance}} was looted, {{providing a}} {{significant source of}} ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency. The invasion phase concluded <b>when</b> Tikrit, <b>Saddam's</b> home town, fell with little resistance to the U.S. Marines of Task Force Tripoli.|$|R
50|$|In the lead-up to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq {{and during the}} fighting, Senor was a Pentagon and White House adviser based in Doha, Qatar, at U.S. Central Command Forward; he was subsequently based in Kuwait, working with General Jay Garner during {{the final days of}} the invasion and was in southern Iraq <b>when</b> the <b>Saddam</b> Hussein regime fell.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} damage {{occurred in}} the early 1990s, <b>when</b> the <b>Saddam</b> Hussein government of Iraq undertook a series of major destructive drainage projects, at least partly in reprisal for the 1991 uprisings. Reports suggested that {{the flow of the}} Euphrates had been diverted into the Third River, a huge drainage canal. By 2002, the Hammar Marshes and the Haur al-Hammar had entirely disappeared.|$|R
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E
2500|$|According to Russ Baker, {{writing in}} the Columbia Journalism Review, a [...] "vast network" [...] based in the U.S. and elsewhere, fed Iraq's warring {{capabilities}} right up until August 1990, <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> invaded Kuwait.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Goldberg's [...] "The Great Terror" [...] {{published}} in The New Yorker {{argued that the}} threat posed to America by Saddam Hussein was significant, discussing the possible connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda {{as well as the}} Iraqi nuclear program, averring that there was [...] "some debate among arms-control experts about exactly <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> will have nuclear capabilities. But there is no disagreement that Iraq, if unchecked, will have them soon... There is little doubt what Saddam might do with an atomic bomb or with his stocks of biological and chemical weapons." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the 2003 U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq, {{the camp was}} taken over by elite American special operations forces. The main purpose of the camp was to interrogate prisoners for information about Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The New York Times reported on 19 March 2006, the three-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion, that the elite unit, known as Task Force 6-26, used the facility to interrogate prisoners {{both before and after the}} Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal. [...] Some of the interrogation took place in [...] "The Black Room," [...] which used to be a torture chamber <b>when</b> <b>Saddam's</b> government ran the facility. The camp was the target of repeated warnings and investigations from U.S. officials since August 2003. There were placards around the camp that read [...] "No Blood No Foul," [...] a reference to the notion, described by a Pentagon official, that [...] "If you don't make them bleed, they can't prosecute for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Khalil al-Duleimi is an {{attorney}} best known for representing Saddam Hussein at his trial. He was one of 22 lawyers representing Hussein at his trial, {{and the only one}} based in Iraq. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam's</b> legal team learned that Saddam was to be interrogated, they requested the presence of a lawyer. Al-Duleimi represented Saddam, and told the head of the legal team, Jordan-based lawyer Ziad al-Khasawneh, that Saddam had answered the tribunal with [...] "confidence and serenity". Al-Duleimi has spent significant time in hiding since his meeting with Saddam, as he received numerous death threats, including a message to his home warning that suicide cells had been formed specifically to kill him as an example to all other attorneys who had volunteered for Saddam's defense team. In May 2005, upon release of photos showing Saddam sleeping and washing his trousers, by an anonymous US Army officer, al-Duleimi made comments critical of the United States Army, but did not comment on a possible lawsuit proposed by al-Khasawneh.|$|R
50|$|The group drew {{criticism}} in July 2005, <b>when</b> Ziad al-Khasawneh, <b>Saddam</b> Hussain's lawyer, resigned, citing interference {{from the group}} in the legal process. A high-profile {{member of the committee}} was part of Hussein's defence team.|$|R
2500|$|Iran {{has taken}} {{an active role in}} Iraq. Talks between the two nations (Iran and Iraq) have been successful, with Iran even {{going so far as to}} build a major Iranian Bank branch inside Iraq. Iran {{stresses}} that it supports the government of Iraq. Indeed, the main party that supports the Iraqi government and the US coalition, SCIRI, is also close to Iran. [...] Its leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who has been invited at the White House, was a refugee in Iran <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was the leader of Iraq. On 21 February 2007, his own son, coming from Iran with armed guards, was arrested by US forces and later released with excuses by US forces.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1974 Arab League summit held in Morocco on 26October, a Fatah plot {{to assassinate}} Hussein upon his arrival was {{uncovered}} by the Moroccan authorities. The plot did not deter Hussein from joining the summit, {{but at the}} end Jordan had to join all the Arab countries in recognizing the PLO as [...] "the sole representative of the Palestinian people", a diplomatic defeat for Hussein. The relationship between Jordan and the United States deteriorated when Jordan refused to join the Camp David Accords. The Accords formed the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and allowed the withdrawal of Israel from the Sinai. In 1978 Hussein went to Baghdad {{for the first time since}} 1958; there, he met Iraqi politician Saddam Hussein. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> became president of Iraq in 1979, Hussein supported Saddam's Iran–Iraq War that stretched from 1980 to 1988. The relationship grew as Saddam provided Jordan with subsidized oil, and Jordan allowed Iraq to use the Port of Aqaba for its exports.|$|E
2500|$|The Iraqi Air Force {{was founded}} in 1931, during British control of Iraq after {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire in WW1, with only a few pilots. Aside from a brief period during the Second World War, the Iraqi Air Force {{operated}} mostly British aircraft until the 14 July Revolution in 1958, when the new Iraqi government began increased diplomatic relationships with the Soviet Union. The air force used both Soviet and British aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s. <b>When</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein came to power in 1979, the air force grew very quickly when Iraq ordered more Soviet and French aircraft. Its peak came after the long and bloody Iran–Iraq War, which ended in 1988, when it consisted of 1029 aircraft of all types (of which 550 were combat ready), becoming the largest air force in the region. Its downfall came during the Gulf War (1990–91) and continued while coalition forces enforced no-fly zones. The remains of Iraq's air force were destroyed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Rauf Rashid Abd al-Rahman (born [...] 1941) is the {{replacement}} chief {{judge of the}} Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal's Al-Dujail trial of Saddam Hussein in 2006, <b>when</b> he sentenced <b>Saddam</b> {{and some of his}} top aides to death by hanging.|$|R
50|$|The zoo was {{destroyed}} during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. For their own safety, zoo workers suspended feeding {{the animals in}} early April 2003, <b>when</b> Fedayeen <b>Saddam</b> troops took up defensive positions around the zoo as U.S. forces began the battle of Baghdad. Out of the original 650 to 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo only 35 had survived to the eighth day of the invasion, and these tended to {{be some of the}} larger animals.|$|R
50|$|A Map of Home {{is set in}} Palestinian-Israeli conflict, {{specifically}} {{during the}} Gulf War. The story is first set in Kuwait, then Egypt, and ends in Texas. There is political, cultural, and social turmoil throughout Kuwait, <b>when</b> eventually <b>Saddam</b> Hussein invades Kuwait in 1990. This forces the family to flee to Kuwait. The author, Randa Jarrar, grew up in Kuwait and Egypt, moving to America soon after the Gulf War; This story is loosely autobiographical. A Map of Home discusses the Gulf War, warfare and bombings, the invasion of Kuwait, and more political and social turmoil.|$|R

50|$|Clinton {{authorized}} {{the use of}} punitive military force against Saddam's regime {{as part of this}} strategy, such as in 1993, when it was discovered that the Iraqi leader had plotted to assassinate George H. W. Bush, and in 1998 <b>when</b> <b>Saddam</b> expelled United Nations weapons inspectors.|$|E
5000|$|He is a {{major in}} the Territorial Army and was mobilised for active service in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq he came under {{repeated}} enemy fire until his tour of duty ended <b>when</b> he reached <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's river palace in Basra.

50|$|<b>When</b> Iraqi President <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{began to}} redeploy his forces {{along the border}} of Kuwait in late 1994, Tripoli was sent as the initial show of force. Assuming duties with other ships in the Northern Persian Gulf, Tripoli {{prepared}} to conduct amphibious operations in response to any further Southward movement by Iraqi forces. Operation Vigilant Warrior resulted in the withdrawal of Husseins forces away from Kuwaits border.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all Muslim {{political}} and religious leaders condemned the attacks. The leaders vehemently denouncing the attacks included the leaders of Egypt (Hosni Mubarak), the Palestinian Authority (Yasser Arafat), Libya (Muammar Gaddafi), Syria (Bashar al-Assad), Iran (Mohamed Khatami) and Pakistan (Pervez Musharraf). The sole exception was Iraq, <b>when</b> the then-president <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, said of the attacks that [...] "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity". Saddam would later offer sympathy to the Americans killed in the attacks.|$|R
