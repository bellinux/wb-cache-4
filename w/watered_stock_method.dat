5000|$|The {{practice}} of <b>watered</b> <b>stock</b> was sharply criticized {{by members of}} the Social Gospel movement such as George D. Herron and Walter Rauschenbusch. For example, in 1898, Herron said [...] "watered <b>stock</b> is a <b>method</b> of high treason by which corporations forcibly tax the nation for private profit, and by which they annually extort millions from American toilers and producers. It is... essentially a system of violence, spoil, and robbery." ...|$|R
40|$|Historical <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> of continuous, season-long grazing of {{pastures}} {{with little}} account of growing conditions have caused some degradation within grazed landscapes in northern Australia. Alternative <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> {{have been implemented}} to address this degradation and raise the productivity and profitability of the principal livestock, cattle. Because information comparing <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> is limited, an evaluation was undertaken to quantify the effects of <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> on pastures, soils and grazing capacity. The approach was to monitor existing <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> on nine commercial beef properties in north and south Queensland. Environments included native and exotic pastures and eucalypt (lighter soil) and brigalow (heavier soil) land types. Breeding and growing cattle were grazed under each method. The owners/managers, formally trained in pasture and grazing management, made all management decisions affecting the study sites. Three <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> were compared: continuous (with rest), extensive rotation and intensive rotation (commonly referred to as 'cell grazing'). There were two or three <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> examined on each property: in total 21 methods (seven continuous, six extensive rotations and eight intensive rotations) were monitored over 74 paddocks, between 2006 and 2009. Pasture and soil surface measurements {{were made in the}} autumns of 2006, 2007 and 2009, while the paddock grazing was analysed from property records for the period from 2006 to 2009. The first 2 years had drought conditions (rainfall average 3. 4 decile) but were followed by 2 years of above-average rainfall. There were no consistent differences between <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> across all sites over the 4 years for herbage mass, plant species composition, total and litter cover, or landscape function analysis (LFA) indices. There were large responses to rainfall in the last 2 years with mean herbage mass in the autumn increasing from 1970 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2006 - 07 to 3830 kg DM ha(- 1) in 2009. Over the same period, ground and litter cover and LFA indices increased. Across all sites and 4 years, mean grazing capacity was similar for the three <b>stocking</b> <b>methods.</b> There were, however, significant differences in grazing capacity between <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> at four sites but these differences were not consistent between <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> or sites. Both the continuous and intensive rotation methods supported the highest average annual grazing capacity at different sites. The results suggest that cattle producers can obtain similar ecological responses and carry similar numbers of livestock under any of the three <b>stocking</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Managing and {{measuring}} the grazing and nutrition of cattle {{are required to}} improve the productivity and profitability of beef businesses in northern Australia. The quality and composition of the diet selected by cattle grazing in three <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> (continuous, extensive rotation and intensive (cell) rotation) on nine commercial properties in Queensland were estimated using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy analyses of fresh faeces; 585 faecal samples were analysed between 2005 and 2009. Sites were in two regions (north and south Queensland) and on two vegetation communities, namely brigalow (Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. ex Benth.) on clay soils and eucalypts on light-textured soil types. Pastures were dominated by perennial sown exotic grass species, predominantly Cenchrus ciliaris L. (buffel grass) at five sites and Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) (Sabi grass) at one site, and by native perennial tussock grasses at three sites. Seasonal profiles of dietary crude protein, dry matter digestibility, faecal nitrogen concentration, proportion of non-grass, ratio of crude protein to digestibility and an estimate of liveweight gain are presented for each <b>stocking</b> <b>method.</b> Overall, dietary crude protein, digestibility, faecal nitrogen, the crude protein[*]:[*]digestibility ratio and liveweight gain were significantly higher for animals grazed continuously, with short rest periods, than for animals in extensive or intensive rotations. There was a significant interaction between <b>stocking</b> <b>method</b> and pasture growing conditions, measured as a simulated growth index, for dietary crude protein and faecal nitrogen. There {{was no difference between}} <b>stocking</b> <b>methods</b> during periods when the index was 0. 5), crude protein and faecal nitrogen were higher with continuous grazing than in the extensive and intensive rotations. For cattle producers considering alternative <b>stocking</b> <b>methods,</b> the results suggest they can obtain similar ecological responses under any of the three methods and diet quality will be higher during the pasture growing period in continuously grazed pastures...|$|R
