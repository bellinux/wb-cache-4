500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|Amid this tension, Willkie and Roosevelt met for {{the first}} time, at the White House on December 13, 1934. [...] The meeting was {{outwardly}} cordial, but each man told his own version of what occurred: the president boasted of having outtalked Willkie, while the executive sent a soon-to-be-famous telegram to his wife: [...] "CHARM OVERRATED... I DIDNT TELL HIM <b>WHAT</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>THINK</b> <b>OF</b> HIM" [...] Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up, stated so in his 1935 State of the Union address and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent. In the meantime, the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new Norris Dam could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow, and the company ran [...] "spite lines" [...] that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non-compete agreement over broad areas.|$|E
2500|$|Tutu criticised {{politicians}} for {{debating whether}} to give the poor an income grant of $16 (£12) a month and said the idea should be seriously considered. Tutu has often spoken {{in support of the}} Basic Income Grant (BIG) which has so far been defeated in parliament. After the first round of volleys were fired, South African Press Association journalist, Ben Maclennan reported Tutu's response as: [...] "Thank you Mr President for telling me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me, that I am—a liar with scant regard for the truth, and a charlatan posing with his concern for the poor, the hungry, the oppressed and the voiceless." ...|$|E

Well, old John, <b>what</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the music? as good as one of your war-songs, ha?” ...|$|R

Though I lived abroad with such as them for twelve months, I have not forgotten the sweet scent of our English hedgerows, nor the wholesomeness of English household manners. <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In December 1998, Columbus Mayor Greg Latshukta {{announced}} he would not seek a third term in 1999. [...] Johnson briefly considered {{a run for the}} seat, but decided against it. [...] The same month, Johnson told The Columbus Dispatch he was investigating overturning the city council's vote to grant benefits to domestic partners of city employers, according them the same treatment as spouses. [...] Johnson objected to the idea itself, the cost, {{and the manner in which}} the question was rushed through the council without any public notice or debate. [...] "No matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the merits, the process on an issue they knew could raise serious questions from the public was circumvented," [...] said Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1976 Rolling Stone interview, Young {{gives an}} insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: After I {{recorded}} Pasadena our relationship just developed. [...] They play me their songs and say: [...] "See <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> this." [...] Usually I like it, sometimes I don't. [...] Sometimes I pick out something they've written and say [...] "I want to do this", like I did with Things to do. (For the JPY album), we worked {{out some of the}} songs on the road. [...] Others are worked out in the studio and some, like Standing in the Rain are produced by the studio system. [...] Harry and George work it out and I come in later to do the vocal.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1942, Feightner was {{assigned}} to VF-10, the Grim Reapers, aboard [...] flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat. The commanding officer of VF-10 was James H. Flatley whom Feightner described as [...] "a true leader [...] epitomizes <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as a squadron commander." [...] Enterprise left Pearl Harbor on October 16, 1942 for the South Pacific as part of Task Force King. Less than ten days later, Feightner performed his first night carrier landing after the search and attack group for which he provided cover became lost and {{did not return to}} the carrier until after dark. On October 26, 1942, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Feightner shot down his first enemy aircraftan Aichi D3A dive bomber that was attacking Enterprise. He was also credited with a probable kill of another aircraft. Feightner was awarded an Air Medal and gold award star for his actions that day.|$|E

2500|$|In May, Simon Schama, earlier mooted as a {{supporter}} of Gove's reforms of the history curriculum, delivered an excoriating speech in which he characterised the finalised proposals as [...] "insulting and offensive" [...] and [...] "pedantic and utopian", accusing Gove of constructing a [...] "ridiculous shopping list" [...] of subjects. He urged the audience at the Hay Festival: [...] "Tell Michael Gove <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. Let him know." [...] In June, leaked documents revealed that {{a member of the}} government's curriculum advisory group had described the reform process as having had [...] "a very chaotic feel. It's typical of government policy at the moment: they don't think things through very carefully, they don't listen to anyone and then just go ahead and rush into major changes." [...] In September, Robin Alexander said that the proposed reforms to the primary-level national curriculum were [...] "neo Victorian", [...] "educationally inappropriate and pedagogically counter-productive". In October almost 200 people, including Carol Ann Duffy, Melvin Burgess and Michael Rosen, as well as academics from Oxford, Bristol and Newcastle signed a letter to The Times condemning Gove's reforms, warning of the [...] "enormous" [...] and negative risks they posed to children and their education.|$|E

What richness of coloring!"
