50|$|Temporary {{snow fences}} are usually {{one of two}} varieties: {{perforated}} orange plastic sheeting attached to stakes at regular intervals (the type usually used for construction site fencing or temporary sports field fencing), or a cedar or other lightweight <b>wood</b> <b>strip</b> and wire fence, also attached to metal stakes. A permanent snow fence usually consists of poles with horizontal planks running across {{them so that they}} cover just over one-half of the total fence area. The bottom 10% to 15% of the fence should be left open so that snow does not settle directly under the fence, which would reduce its effective height. Taller fences trap more snow. Taking the height of the fence as one unit, it should be placed thirty-five units or more to windward of the road or building that it is meant to protect. Permanent snow fences can also consist of lines of closely spaced shrubs, conifer trees or maize stalks.|$|E
50|$|The 1911 school {{replaced}} {{an earlier}} school that had existed {{on the site}} since the 1880s. By the early 20th century local farmers were prospering, and chose to build a high-quality replacement school. The school features a large belfry with a 30-gallon cast iron bell on a higher-than-usual roof. The one-story wood frame school measures about 34.5 ft deep and 22.5 ft wide on a shaped stone foundation. The sole door is centered on the gabled front facade with the belfry above, flanked by two two-over-two sash windows. A cloakroom vestibule spans {{the front of the}} school on the west side, opening into the classroom. There are no windows on the north side, a concession to winter winds. Two windows on the east side and four on the south side light the room, which features a pressed tin ceiling. Walls were plastered and had beaded wood wainscoting. The plaster has been replaced by drywalll and the wainscot has been preserved. The <b>wood</b> <b>strip</b> floor has been preserved.|$|E

Polypropylene films were compression molded to the wood surfaces and peel forces were measured. The treated cellulose fibers were suspended and mixed with polypropylene fibers in water, formed into thin sheets by wet forming, dried, and compression molded to melt the polypropylene. Treated wood surfaces gave two to six times the dry peel force versus untreated wood surfaces. However, the wet peel force of treated wood degraded to that of untreated wood. The elongation, fail stress, and tensile energy absorption of treated molded sheets were all increased over the untreated fibers for {{both dry and wet}} testing; the wet-tested properties were especially enhanced by the silane treatment...|$|E

[25] {{investigated}} {{the estimation of}} mechanical properties and specific gravity for 5 -year-old Eucalyptus having broad moisture content range by NIRS. Calibrations had good relationships between values measured in laboratory and NIR predicted values obtained from small clear samples. Scimleck et al. [26] examined the estimation of density, MOE and modulus of rupture (MOR) using NIR spectra collected from the transverse surface of Pernambuco blocks. The success of calibrations suggests that NIR assessment of Pernambuco wood properties in the field may be possible. Watanabe et al. [27] used NIRS for rapidly predicting the longitudinal growth strain (LGS). NIR spectra and LGS were measured from peripheral locations of three Sugi green logs. The predicted peripheral LGS distribution moderately fitted with the measured one. Calibration and prediction models for balsam and black spruce wood disk average properties were developed using NIR spectral data by Xu et al. [28]. Results showed that using NIR spectra from three spots per <b>wood</b> <b>strip</b> was sufficient for the modeling and prediction for density and MOE.|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{studied the}} {{terrestrial}} micromammals {{living in the}} “Parco Natura Viva” and in some surrounding areas, near Bussolengo (province of Verona). Animals were captured alive by non selective, Ugglan-type traps, which allow the imprisonment of multiple specimens at a time. We identified 5 terrestrial mammal species, 3 Rodentia and 2 Insectivora: Wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, Brown rat Rattus norvegicus, Yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis, Lesser white-toothed shrew Crocidura suaveolens and Bi-coloured white-toothed shrew Crocidura leucodon. The Wood mouse was found widely spread (310 contacts) {{both inside and outside}} the park, in wooded and meadow areas, occupied mostly by neglected grasslands and shrubs and next to an unmanaged <b>wood</b> <b>strip.</b> The Yellow-necked mouse was found only in one out of 11 surveyed areas (13 captures), characterized by xeric-termophile shrub species and butcher’s broom undergrowth. The Brown rat (19 contacts) was detected both in areas outside the park and on internal but impoverished ones (as those near the dunghill). Lesser white-toothed shrew (5 contacts) and Bi-coloured white-toothed shrew (1 contact) were found only outside the park or near its boundaries...|$|E

3000|$|The {{cases of}} the Floral-belt Dai calling heng and the Aoyao {{treating}} ailments with bitter juice raise queries about the universality of symbols. There is no trace of symbol or metaphor in the abovementioned Floral-belt Dai calling the heng of grain. Calling heng, as explained by the Floral-belt Dai, is calling the scattering heng back. It is the same with housewives calling grazing geese and chickens back home at dusk 23; “We just coax it back.” 24 None of the props they use, such as lunchboxes, sickles, wine, water, or <b>wood</b> <b>strips</b> for telling fortunes, refer to heng. Rice in a lunchbox and wine in a bottle are prepared for heng that is called back; a sickle is to hook heng back; dropping <b>wood</b> <b>strips</b> is to see whether heng has been called back already. That is, during the activities of calling the heng of grain, people’s calls directly work on heng. There are no symbols here {{since there is no}} signifier or signified.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental research performed with spruce wood (Picea abies L.), originating from mature trees and thinnings cut from the same forest parcel from the Stroesti-Arges region in Romania. Solid wood panels were manufactured, both from heat-treated and untreated strips. The panels were open-air exposed for three winter months, in order to evaluate the colour and dimensional modifications which may occur if this material is used under outdoor conditions. The results showed that the panels made from heat-treated <b>wood</b> <b>strips</b> swelled by up to 74 % less in case of mature wood and by up to 60 % less in the case of juvenile wood. The colour of the heat-treated wood panels got lighter in time, the total colour change after three months ranging up to E*= 12, while the panels made from untreated <b>wood</b> <b>strips</b> suffered severe darkening during the period of open-air exposure (L*=- 16) and their total colour change ranged up to E*= 19.

Above Mach 0.91, however, the X-4 still oscillated.|$|R
