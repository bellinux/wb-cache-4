5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible, to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based on religion <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats {{overall in the}} People's Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims {{were more likely to}} vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Marrakesh {{has long}} been an {{important}} centre for healthcare in Morocco, and the regional rural and urban populations alike are reliant upon hospitals in the city. The psychiatric hospital installed by the Merinid Caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 16th century was described by the historian 'Abd al-Wahfd al- Marrakushi {{as one of the greatest}} in the world at the time. A strong Andalusian influence <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital, and many of the physicians to the Caliphs came from places such as Seville, Zaragoza and Denia in eastern Spain.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself {{did not support the}} headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{performance of the}} night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught {{in the glare of}} search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of private piers situated upon {{the western and}} northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed {{as a result of}} Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to the Tabernacle Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants littering the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to sea vessels was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised not to touch downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted.|$|E

5|$|China's newly commercialized society <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{differences}} between its northern {{capital and the}} earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along {{the streets of the}} city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Barbaro {{decided that}} the hajduks would be {{permitted}} to settle in Risan {{and a number of}} neighbouring villages. Soon after the decision was made, the hajduks and frontier Ottomans came into conflict, resulting in many Ottoman casualties. The Ottoman government then demanded that the Venetian official (bailo) in Constantinople remove the hajduks from Risan. The Venetian government decided to move the hajduks of the Bay of Kotor to Istria on the northern Adriatic coast. Colonisation began in May 1671, with the Venetian captain in charge of Istria being informed of the pending arrival of 1,300 hajduks. By the beginning of June 1671, all hajduks from Risan had been transported by sea to Istria. Istria had been depopulated by epidemics and the Uskok War (1615–18); and it therefore made sense to relocate the hajduks to eliminate the frontier clashes between the hajduks and Ottomans, which were disturbing the peace between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians also wanted to repopulate Istria, so the Venetian Senate made the decision to resettle the hajduks there. Barbaro guaranteed the hajduks tax exemptions and appropriations, the appointment of four judges to mediate their disputes, and the allocation of livestock and agricultural tools. Apart from Puljština in southern Istria, the hajduks requested grants of land on the Buzet karst. Friction between the hajduks and Venetians <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negotiations between the hajduk leaders and captain Lunardo Mercella; as {{a significant part of the}} promised benefits were not forthcoming, four hajduk representativesNikola Popović, buljubaša Milošević, Pivljanin and Petar Babićappealed directly to the Doge of Venice to confirm Barbaro's chapters. Barbaro calmed the hajduks down by regulating their status. The Venetian government initially sought to disperse the hajduks across the Venetian–Ottoman frontier in order to prevent conflict with other Venetian subjects, but they were temporarily settled at Pula in Istria.|$|E

25|$|The {{improbable}} {{run of the}} Drillers {{had made}} the rounds in the media, and coinciding with the poor season the Oilers were having, suddenly the Drillers were the flavour of the month in Edmonton.

The win gave the Drillers a 21–19 record for the year, and a first round playoff date with the Milwaukee Wave.|$|E
25|$|This fission stage made fusion weapons {{considerably}} more dirty {{than they were}} made out to be. This <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> towering cloud of deadly fallout that followed the Bravo test. When the Soviet Union tested its first megaton device in 1955, {{the possibility of a}} limited nuclear war seemed even more remote in the public and political mind. Even cities and countries that were not direct targets would suffer fallout contamination. Extremely harmful fission products would disperse via normal weather patterns and embed in soil and water around the planet.|$|E

25|$|Mi'kmaq and Acadian {{resistance}} <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Halifax region. On 2 April 1756, Mi'kmaq received {{payment from}} the Governor of Quebec for 12 British scalps taken at Halifax. Acadian Pierre Gautier, son of Joseph-Nicolas Gautier, led Mi'kmaq warriors from Louisbourg on three raids against Halifax Peninsula in 1757. In each raid, Gautier took prisoners, scalps or both. Their last raid happened in September and Gautier went with four Mi'kmaq, and killed and scalped two British {{men at the}} foot of Citadel Hill. Pierre went on to participate in the Battle of Restigouche.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Ćorluka had signed for Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £5.5million on a six-year contract, joining his fellow Croatian international and best friend Luka Modrić at the club. During the match against Stoke City on 19 October, Ćorluka was severely injured; kneed under his chin by teammate Heurelho Gomes, he was immediately knocked unconscious. After ten minutes of on-field treatment, he was rushed to hospital where it {{was announced}} no serious damage <b>was</b> <b>evident.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> League Cup final on 1 March 2009, Ćorluka scored his first and Tottenham's only penalty in the shootout loss to Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the years}} after the {{establishment}} of Israel, the Military establishment enjoyed a degree of independence given to it by Ben-Gurion. This <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attendance of the Chief of General Staff in Cabinet and security Cabinet meetings as an equal and not as a subordinate. Even after the Agranat Commission inquiry following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when the roles, the powers, and the duties of the Prime Minister, Defense Minister and Chief of General Staff were clarified and the rules and standards of monitoring where established between the military and the political spheres, the military still continued to enjoy disproportionate status {{at the expense of the}} civilian authorities.|$|E

25|$|During this post-war era {{and into}} the 1950s, the various units of the Corps {{continued}} to be identified by their military branch. The traditional branches (Infantry, Field Artillery, Cavalry, Engineers, Coast Artillery, Quartermaster, Ordnance, Signal Corps, Armor, Chemical Corps, Transportation, Army Security, and Army Air Force) continued to be represented. But the strength of air power {{and the rise of}} the importance of the U.S. Air Force during this era <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organization of the Cadet Corps as Army Air Corps units became Air Force flights (later squadrons). Veterans companies and flights were formed to separate these older veterans from younger cadets. Beginning in 1948 athletes were organized into their own batteries (later companies) to accommodate special team practice schedules.|$|E
25|$|In Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2007), Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside}} a trial judge's {{decision}} as he held that the judge had descended into the arena and joined in the fray. This <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner the trial judge had questioned the witnesses. There were excessive questions by the judge, especially some {{in the nature of}} a cross-examination. The conclusions formed by the judge also arose out of the line of questioning that she herself had adopted. The High Court also mentioned that it was the duty of the Prosecution to bring out the evidence to prove its case and not the judge's duty to do so, even if it was an attempt to make up for any shortfall in the conduct of the case by the prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|The VVS {{brought in}} large numbers of {{aircraft}} {{from all over the}} country, though most were obsolete and training machines. This brought the strength of VVS to 3,700 by August. But ill-trained and inexperienced crews resulted in continuing heavy losses. Yet by 30 August, the VVS had sustained air superiority, though it failed to help Zhukov make any head way at Yelnya, and Guderian achieving a series of tactical success at Roslavl and Krichev. The effect of Soviet aviation <b>was</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe losses among German transports. By 31 August, the Luftwaffe had lost 1,320 (820 destroyed) since the 22 June including 170 Army reconnaissance aircraft and 97 transports and liaison machines. The overwhelming majority were lost to air attack. The VVS reported the loss of 903 aircraft from 10 July to the 10 September.|$|E
