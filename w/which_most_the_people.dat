In this study the valley divided into three stations, each station contained three treated substations and three control substations. The control substations selected from the farms, which are historically free from pesticides. Due care has been taken to insure that the treated sub-stations were from the closest area to the control substations. The average use of Dimethoate 40 % E. C is 1 - 2 ml/L water. The treatment replication was 1 - 3 times within the period of 2 - 3 weeks. In this study also, we analyzed the total concentration of Dimethoate, and its metabolite; Omethoate in the soil layer of 0 - 15 cm. The analysis of Dimethoate and Omethoate residues from representative soil samples covered the major part of the Zendan valley was done by the technique of LC-MS, and the results revealed that the detected levels ranged from 0. 914 to 5. 180 mg/kg air-dried soil for Dimethoate residues and 0. 001 to 0. 067 mg/kg air-dried soil for Omethoate residues.

However, for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of <b>the</b> global South – <b>which</b> comprises <b>most</b> of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in <b>the</b> world – the struggle to ‘live faithfully’ amid the problems of world poverty, climate change, conflict and development {{can not be separated from}} their struggle for justice and emancipation.

These are the low lying areas which are {{by its very nature}} vulnerable to flood water and swamps because initially they acted as collection areas for storm water Climate change in Kampala is largely seen in terms of an increased severity of floods due to heavy, sudden and recurrent rainfalls. Local communities try to adjust to these effects using local innovation and technological input. Some of these coping measures can however assist families in the short-term, but cannot deal with increasing and ever more severe shocks. This study was conducted in Natete, an informal settlement, a “slum” by any other definition; it is located in one of suburbs of Kampala city. This study was out to investigate the impact of the increased frequency of climate change induced floods in the settlement and the adaptation strategies applied by its inhabitants. It was found out that in Natete the situation was not at its best. There were coping measures practiced at different levels. Their effectiveness was determined by capacity in I terms of access to resources. Those who has access to resources, employed better methods such use of gabions, raised foundations such that water could not enter their premises. Their counterpart did activities which could just save them on daily basis. Their measures were found not be long term solution to building resilience. This challenges the recent romanticizing of local knowledge to adaption. In actually sense, local knowledge for this case proved not to be effective at all.
