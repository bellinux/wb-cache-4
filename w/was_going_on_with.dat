25|$|The delays {{became so}} great that even ABC mocked the {{lateness}} with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently {{for the arrival of}} new episodes at ABC's corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the show's plot since it had been so long since the last new episode.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode. The {{cause was}} unknown and FH Aachen {{put out a}} call to all amateur radio {{operators}} {{to try to find}} out what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the CubeSat. A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of powering up, turning on the heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not know what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "jammed in Regionals, {{something}} that used to matter", and did so without any [...] "meaningful buildup to the competition". Poniewozik described the competition showdown as [...] "unconnected with the episode we began watching", and Canning said that [...] "Regionals just got in the way" [...] and the performances [...] "did a disservice to what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> Karofsky". Votta characterized the McKinley victory as [...] "so secondary {{to the point of}} this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic", and VanDerWerff summarized, [...] "When New Directions hoists that trophy aloft at the end, it’s about the least compelling victory for the group yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{involvement}} with Billy Abbott is another significant romance for Chloe, {{and the characters}} marry shortly after Delia is born. However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> her was a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going to mess with her. I mean, no one dumps Chloe Mitchell!" ...|$|E
500|$|A cruiser {{reported}} aircraft {{detected by}} R.D.F {{on the port}} bow of the convoy and Ledbury was taken through the convoy {{to get to the}} engaged side; but a heavy and sustained attack by Junkers 88s dive bombing developed when the destroyer was still in between the two columns. The attack became increasingly indefensible; two ships were hit, one exploded, the other remained afloat but both were creating a huge mass of burning petrol on the water. Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes. Another ship exploded, and Captain Hill assumed that [...] was torpedoed at this time. Ledbury called Manchester to make sure that she was standing by the damaged ships; the destroyer sighted six ships out in the darkness steaming on various courses, mostly in a north or north-western direction. The destroyer called up the nearest ship and ordered course 120. This ship was [...] The orders were repeated to the nearest merchantmen. Ledbury then returned to Ohio intending to take her in tow, but the tanker reported that she could steam with her steering aft but had no compass. The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted [...] that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships. During the night, Ledbury sighted four E-Boat wrecks just around the next corner (These were sighted at 02:04, 03:32, 03:45 and 04:31 respectively).|$|E
