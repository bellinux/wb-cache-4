5|$|Proposals for a route {{avoiding}} Central London {{had been}} in place since the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. In 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had built up schemes for new roads, including what became the North Circular Road, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.|$|E

5|$|The {{first phase}} saw the {{addition}} of an inner railway track, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> take {{a third of the}} weight of the telescope. The outer railway track, which had been decaying and sinking over the previous years, was relaid in the second phase. Four bogies and their steelwork were added on the inner track, and the existing bogies on the outer track were overhauled.|$|E
5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator {{was funded by the}} Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E

5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{to make the}} river suitable for coasters began in 1856, when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer. He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900, a programme <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers, and which ensured its profitability. The 12 locks of the 1830s were replaced by five much larger locks, {{and most of the}} bridges were replaced by swing bridges, which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a Magnox power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Kilburn {{became a}} {{professor}} of computing engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Manchester in 1960. He was instrumental in forming the School of Computer Science in 1964, becoming the first head of the department, and served as Dean of the Faculty of Science from 1970 to 1972, and pro-vice-chancellor of the university from 1976 to 1979. His final computer project was the MU5, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> facilitate the running of programs in high-level programming languages. An analysis of code written for the Atlas gave an insight into the frequency of different operands and control structures. The project was assisted by a £630,000 Science Research Council (SRC) grant awarded over five-years. The design heavily influenced the successful ICL 2900 Series.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> hold seven men.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What {{is important is}} the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in {{the principle of the}} multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> retrieve {{the crew of}} an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts {{who would have been}} aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{decided to}} give all {{characters}} in the game voices as Iizuka believed that full dialogue helps add depth to both the story and gameplay. With Nights already designed as an androgynous character, the team wanted to leave impressions regarding gender up to the player, despite Nights having a female voice in the game. The team designed the Nights franchise to have a distinctly British style, in contrast to Sonic the Hedgehog, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be more American. Thus, Bellbridge—the game's main setting—closely resembles London, {{and all of the}} game's characters have English accents. The development team consisted of 26 members of Sonic Team in the United States, while all sound work and CGI was developed in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols.

The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved {{by increasing the}} boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, {{was the use of}} a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbreds in the United States have {{historically}} been used not only for racing but also to improve other breeds. The early import Messenger was {{the foundation of the}} Standardbred, and Thoroughbred blood was also instrumental {{in the development of the}} American Quarter Horse. The foundation stallion of the Morgan breed is held by some to have been sired by a Thoroughbred. Between World War I and World War II, the U.S. Army used Thoroughbred stallions as part of their Remount Service, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> improve the stock of cavalry mounts.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
