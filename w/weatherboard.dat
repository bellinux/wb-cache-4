5|$|A Wesleyan chapel {{was built}} in 1865; a small <b>weatherboard</b> {{building}} with an attached Sunday School. The Church eventually fell out of use and became a private home. It was demolished during the 1930s. There {{has not been a}} Roman Catholic church in Carrick—the nearest church is Westbury—but some Catholics are recorded as attending the Anglican Church.|$|E
5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} built, {{also on the}} main road, and opened in 1923. It was a timber-framed <b>weatherboard</b> building, built on land donated by the first Baptist minister's son, the local butcher. The last service at the church was held 28 April 1985. Prior to this, as {{attendance}} declined, the congregations of the Baptist and Uniting Churches had often combined, and roles such as the organist were shared.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body at New England more than doubled to over 500 {{students}} with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, <b>weatherboard</b> huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Chamferboards are an Australian form of <b>weatherboarding</b> using {{tongue-and-groove}} joints to {{link the}} boards together to give a flatter external appearance than regular angled <b>weatherboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{originally}} built of logs and in 1881 covered with <b>weatherboarding.</b> The <b>weatherboarding</b> was removed in 1935, {{and the church}} was restored in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is clad in <b>weatherboards</b> and has timber doors {{and a variety}} of windows, the originals being double hung sashes. Most of the more recent openings are fitted with glass or metal louvres. On the rear elevation is a junction in the <b>weatherboards</b> indicating the later addition of the southeastern aisle. Windows and possibly some of the <b>weatherboards</b> from the earlier southeastern wall have been reused in the addition.|$|R
5|$|After the Second World War, {{the suburb}} began {{to expand rapidly}} with the {{construction}} of many private homes. Yarralumla's image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and <b>weatherboard</b> houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Monds was {{instrumental}} in formation of the first school. This private school was built in 1843, though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845, and the school moved elsewhere in the town. A Government school was built in 1873, next to the current recreation ground, and both schools were open as of 1883. The private school closed late in the 19th Century, but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll. The latter was a <b>weatherboard</b> building. It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid-1930s when the last school in Carrick closed. The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938, though it was later demolished. In the same year the government began funding regular school transport from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley, accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed. Since that time {{there has been no}} school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} school {{was established in}} the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901. Mond's business expanded throughout {{the latter part of the}} 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise. He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston. Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883. The current <b>weatherboard</b> town hall dates from c1900 and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this. At the town's height in the 19th century, just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields, the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400. It had four public houses operating two of which, Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel, remained open in 1901. As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales. Carrick's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston. At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water. It relied on wells, rainwater and the inconstant river.|$|E
