500|$|This is a 7.62×51mm NATO {{version of}} the Mk46, used by USSOCOM, when a heavier {{cartridge}} is required. It is officially classified as an LWMG (Light Weight Machine Gun) and was developed {{as a replacement for}} the Mk 43 Mod 0/1. The M60 based machine guns are a great deal more portable than the heavier M240 based designs used elsewhere in the US military in the infantry medium machine gun role. However, the M60 based designs {{have a long history of}} insufficient reliability. Trials conducted through the mid-1990s led the US Army to replace its M60 with the M240B GPMGs. The M240B, however, <b>weighs</b> <b>in</b> at ≈27.5lb and is about 49" [...] long with the standard barrel. NAVSPECWAR was reluctant to give up the increased portability of the M60 (≈22.5lb, 37.7" [...] OAL with the shortest [...] "Assault Barrel") designs in spite of the M240's increased reliability. A request was put in for a new machine gun in 2001, and FN responded with a scaled-up {{version of the}} M249 weighing in at ≈18.5lb with an OAL of ≈39.5". The new design achieved much better reliability than the M60-based weapons while bettering its light weight and maintaining the same manual of arms as the already in-use M249. USSOCOM was slated to begin receiving deliveries of the new gun in August 2003.|$|E
