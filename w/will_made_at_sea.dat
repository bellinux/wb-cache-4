The mutiny of the title is legalistic, not violent, and takes place during Typhoon Cobra, in December 1944. The court-martial that results provides the dramatic climax to the plot.|$|R

40|$|A {{study is}} made of the {{positive}} gravity anomaly (about 70 milligals free-air) over Bombay {{on the west coast}} of India with the help of new gravity observations <b>made</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and on land. The Bouguer gravity anomalies are interpreted by considering the geology of the area and constructing a model which best fits the observed anomalies. It is suggested that the positive anomaly is due to a mass of high density rocks (probably olivine gabbro) emplaced in the crust just below the Deccan traps in Bombay area. The mass is about ten kilometres thick with a thinner sill-like extension to the west. This interpretation is compared with that proposed by Glennie (1951) which was based on more restricted data...|$|R
