5|$|In Philadelphia, Thompson gains {{employment}} {{as a high}} school gym coach, while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U-Foes, who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in Venom #30, to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin. Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens.</b> Venom #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed. It is revealed that Mania's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way's 2003 Venom series. The symbiote expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote, not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had {{always wanted to be a}} dad, and that he will now take responsibility for Mania.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{pre-existing}} {{weather conditions}} exacerbated the blizzard's effects. November, December and January average temperatures were much below normal. Lake Erie froze over by December 14, 1976; <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> lake-effect snow {{does not occur}} because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow and then dump it when the winds reach shore.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E

25|$|Consumption in {{the twentieth}} and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by {{automobile}} growth; the 1985–2003 oil glut even fueled the sales of low economy vehicles in OECD countries. The 2008 economic crisis {{seems to have had}} some impact on the sales of such vehicles; still, the 2008 oil consumption shows a small increase. In 2016 however Goldman Sachs predicts lower demand due to emerging economies concerns, especially China. The BRICS (Brasil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries might also kick in, as China briefly was the first automobile market in December 2009. The immediate outlook still hints upwards. In the long term, uncertainties linger; the OPEC believes that the OECD countries will push low consumption policies {{at some point in the}} future; <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> it will definitely curb oil sales, and both OPEC and EIA kept lowering their 2020 consumption estimates during the past 5 years. Oil products are more and more in competition with alternative sources, mainly coal and natural gas, both cheaper sources.|$|E

500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E

I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E

So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing.

Mary Jo Catlett appears as recently widowed teacher Mrs. Carlisle, and Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in a recurring role as new astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle. Special guest star Olivia Newton-John appears as herself, portraying the [...] "dark side" [...] of herself; a [...] "mixture of mean and diva". She and Lynch produced an exact re-creation of the original [...] "Physical" [...] video, filming of which took twelve hours. Series musical producer Adam Anders felt that Newton-John's appearance in the episode was organic, explaining: [...] "The best part of Glee is introducing new music to an older generation and old music to a newer generation. There's so much great music. We all listen to music in a vacuum, then we're exposed to things and love it. Olivia Newton-John {{is an example of}} that.

[...] In such cases, Lat uses his art to help educate the young about his faith. [...] Lat trusts his editors to do their jobs and cull what is socially unacceptable for print. [...] In an interview, he revealed his discomfort with the concept of self-publishing, believing that unadulterated or unsupervised cartoon drawing could lead to [...] "rubbish". [...] He prefers to be assertive in areas with which he is comfortable or competent. [...] Lat is adamant on not changing what he has already drawn; several pieces of his cartoons remain unpublished because editors refused to print them unchanged. [...] <b>When</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens,</b> the editors spike (blank) the space for his regular cartoon in the newspaper.

500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> it's really magical to me."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate <b>when</b> <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E
