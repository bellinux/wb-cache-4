5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he would be completely leaving the show. As such, the future of the show <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged {{the other members of the}} crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.|$|E

Many witnesses reported that Conway had insisted on filled water buckets to be positioned in various places back stage or in the rigging loft and kept the fire hose maintained. In contrast, Mike Sweeny could recall using the hose only once, and was not certain of its condition {{on the day of the}} fire; many of his colleagues thought the hose leaked and <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> painter's gallery in the roof above the stage.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese. On the other, {{he was reluctant to}} be seen as betraying his overlord, especially now that he had declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{took the}} 2003 Kansas {{team to the}} NCAA {{championship}} game against Syracuse. Syracuse defeated Kansas, 81â€“78, to win the championship. The {{end of the season}} brought a cloud of uncertainty over KU, as Williams' future <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. During CBS' exit interview with Williams, he was consistently asked if he was taking the North Carolina job instead of his current Kansas team's effort, eventually inspiring him to say to the reporter [...] "I could give a shit about North Carolina right now" [...] to the live mic. Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor. Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing.|$|E

When Lowe arrived from Mechanicsville {{to the site of}} the Intrepid at Gaines' Mill, he saw that the aerostat's envelope was an hour away from being fully inflated. He then called for a camp kettle to have the bottom cut out of it, and he hooked the valve ends of the Intrepid and the Constitution together. He had the gas of the Constitution transferred to the Intrepid and <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air in 15 minutes. From this new vantage point, Lowe was able to report on all the Confederate movements. McClellan took Lowe's advice, repaired the bridge, and had reinforcements sent to Heintzelman's aid.

[...] Near the end of the [...] journey, he had a significant slip, but managed to regain his balance quickly. [...] He called the slip [...] "a wake-up call" [...] for Niagara. [...] "My friend <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basket and I started talking to him, and it was just enough of a distraction", he explained. [...] "The wire kind of moved a little bit and I just misstepped. It's why I've trained for so long: you stay on the wire. Your heart jumps up into your throat and two seconds later, you're fine." [...] The May 9 event was sponsored by Ripley's Believe It or Not which was opening a museum on the harbor. [...] When it opened it June, a feature exhibit allowed visitors to walk on a piece of the wire Wallenda had used in Baltimore.|$|E
2500|$|Garbage {{began writing}} their second album, which would {{go under the}} working title of Sad Alcoholic Clowns, in March 1997 in the band's label head Jerry Moss's {{vacation}} house in Friday Harbor, Washington. The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin, base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year. The group recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track digital system digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24-bit Pro Tools rig. While only one recorder <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early sessions, eventually another was installed to edit, and ultimately a third so Manson could record vocals while the other members fiddled with recordings. Vig estimated that the sample collage approach led to [...] "probably have five albums' worth of music", and songs featuring up to 120 audio tracks. After the digital file was ready, mixing was done in an analog tape deck, which held only 14 tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Before dawn on 27 June, the 347th Provisional Group <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{air over}} Korea, {{with a mission}} to provide cover for the Douglas C-54 Skymaster {{transports}} flying {{in and out of}} Kimpo Airfield as they moved the last civilians out. Fearing that the North Korean Air Force might try to shoot down the transport (a C-54 had been destroyed on the ground at Kimpo by North Korean fighters on 25 June), the Air Force requested air cover to protect the aircraft during takeoff. Fortunately, 339th Fighter All Weather Squadron (F(AW)S) with their F-82Gs were based at Yokota AB and the 68th F(AW)S was based at Itazuke AB Japan. With Lieutenant Colonel John F. Sharp in command, 27 F-82Gs of the 35 in Japan answered the call. Arriving in the early morning, they orbited Kimpo Airfield in three flights, each above the other. Suddenly, at 1150 hours, a mixed group of five North Korean fighters (Soviet-built Yak-9s, Yak-11s and La-7s) appeared, heading for the airfield. One of the Yak-11s immediately scored several hits on 68th F(AW)S pilot Lt. Charles Moran's vertical stabilizer. Moments later, Lt. William G. [...] "Skeeter" [...] Hudson, also of the 68th F(AW)S, initiated a high-G turn to engage the Yak, and soon was closing in on the Yak's tail. He then fired a short burst at close range, scoring hits with his six [...] machine guns. The Yak banked hard to the right, with the F-82G in close pursuit. A second burst hit the Yak's right wing, setting the gas tank on fire and knocking off the right flap and aileron. The North Korean pilot bailed out, but his observer, who was either dead or badly wounded, remained in the doomed aircraft. Parachuting down to Kimpo Airfield, the North Korean pilot was immediately surrounded by South Korean soldiers. Surprisingly, he pulled out a pistol and began firing at them. The South Korean soldiers returned fire, killing him. Moments later, Lt. Moran shot down an La-7 over the airfield, while a few miles away, Major James W. Little, commanding officer of the 339th F(AW)S, shot down another La-7. The C-54 was able to escape safely. Three of the five North Korean aircraft had been shot down, with pilot Lt. William G. [...] "Skeeter" [...] Hudson and radar operator Lt. Carl Fraiser scoring the first United States aerial [...] "kill" [...] of the Korean War.|$|E
