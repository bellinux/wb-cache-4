5|$|On August 26, Czesław Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, {{declared}} {{on television}} {{that the government}} was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate,</b> and five days later he met with Wałęsa. The strikes ended the following day, and on November 30, during a televised debate between Wałęsa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions), Wałęsa scored a public-relations victory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost a}} year of heavy fighting, a large Russian force crossed the Vistula and besieged the capital of Poland on 20 August. Although the siege was {{partially}} lifted soon afterwards and a successful sortie allowed a communication route between {{the city and the}} rest of Poland, a large Russian force remained on the left bank of the Vistula and continued to threaten the city. Russian commander Ivan Paskevich counted on Polish surrender as his Polish counterpart, Jan Krukowiecki, was known {{to be a member of}} the moderate political forces, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Russian tsar Nicholas I, who had been deposed from the Polish throne in January 1831 by the Sejm (Polish parliament). When a less conciliatory faction gained power in Warsaw and the Russian offer of surrender was refused, Paskevich ordered his forces to launch an assault against Warsaw's western defences.|$|E

50|$|At {{this point}} the government, alarmed that the {{rebellion}} might further spread, expressed its <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> with Ayatollah Khashif al-Ghita. The government effectively attempted to divide the rebelling tribes, as while Defense Minister Jafar al-Askari met the sheikhs of the Muntafiq tribes in order to persuade them into a truce the operations against Rumaytha continued until their full suppression on May 21.|$|R
5|$|Warelwast {{served the}} king as an envoy to Pope Urban II in 1095, when {{the king was}} seeking to have the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, Gerard, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, {{at least according to}} Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two clerks travelled very quickly, as they did not leave before 28February 1095 and were back in England by 13May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> and to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. It may well be that the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.|$|E
25|$|In May 2005, Virginia and Maryland {{announced}} that they had reached agreements to allow Maryland to proceed with prosecuting charges there, where the most shootings occurred.

25|$|Black Hawk's {{frequent}} rival was Keokuk, a Sauk war chief held in high esteem by the U.S. government. Officials {{believed that}} he was calm and reasonable, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate,</b> unlike Black Hawk. Black Hawk despised Keokuk, and viewed him as cowardly and self-serving, at one point threatening to kill him for not defending Saukenuk. After the Black Hawk War, US officials designated Keokuk as the main Sauk leader and would only deal with him.|$|E
25|$|Drake {{knew the}} Spanish would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> a ransom, {{in return for}} the saving of their town and the lives of his prisoners. On 12 January the head of the city judiciary, Juan Malarejo, {{approached}} Drake and negotiations began. Drake demanded a huge figure of one million ducats which the Governor declared himself wholly unable to pay. Malarejo procrastinated and as talks continued Drake ordered civic buildings and churches to be put to the torch, one after the other. Applying extra pressure on Malarejo; Drakes men began demolishing the city's imposing stone buildings, which exhausted the English sailors due to the intense labor.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Peel Commission, a British Royal Commission {{headed by}} Earl Peel, {{proposed}} solving the Arab–Jewish conflict by partitioning Palestine into two states. The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations {{as a basis}} for more negotiation. The US Consul General at Jerusalem told the State Department that the Mufti had refused the principle of partition and declined to consider it. The Consul said that the Emir Abdullah urged acceptance on the ground that realities must be faced, but wanted modification of the proposed boundaries and Arab administrations in the neutral enclave. The Consul also noted that Nashashibi sidestepped the principle, but was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> for favourable modifications.|$|E

40|$|In this article, the {{political}} and strategic pertinence of the EZLN to transcend its territorial confinementin Chiapas and its discursive confinement out of the institutional parameters of {{the political}} arena is discussed. The mass mobilisation of supporters and indigenous leaders of the EZLN from San Cristóbal de las Casas towards México City is the means used by the Zapatistas to under go such phenomenal task. From the relessons can be drawn regarding {{the way in which}} it exposed the institutional coherence, the openness and <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> of Zedillo (1994 - 2000) and Fox (2000 - 2006) administrations...|$|R
40|$|The warming of EU – Russia gas {{relations}} {{would be}} considerably {{beneficial to the}} EU, and is an achievable goal if a rational approach is adopted. Fundamental to this, is the acknowledgment of three essential issues. Firstly, EU – Russia gas relations cannot be considered independent of the bleak political context. Secondly, the EU <b>will</b> continue <b>to</b> need Russian gas for the foreseeable future. Thirdly, Russia’s dependence on the EU gas market is becoming much stronger than the EU’s energy reliance on Russian gas. Once these issues are acknowledged and accounted for, an improvement in EU – Russia gas relations is achievable and sustainable. It {{is only a matter}} of <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> and create stable and viable proposals...|$|R
25|$|In 1978, Velasquez {{decided to}} adopt a new {{organizing}} strategy. The union believed that Ohio tomato growers {{would be unable to}} recruit enough workers to see them through a long strike. So that year 2,000 FLOC members walked off their jobs in Ohio. While some growers were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate,</b> big canners such as the Campbell Soup Company were unwilling to pay the higher prices which would accompany a unionized workforce. FLOC initiated a boycott of Campbell's. Six years later, not much had changed even though FLOC had conducted a well-publicized 560-mile march from Toledo to Campbell Soup headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, in 1983. Even the support of the National Council of Churches and a group of Catholic bishops in Ohio failed to sway the company.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008, {{several of}} the {{municipalities}} announced they were considering taking legal action against Citigroup, in either the United Kingdom or the United States, to hold Citigroup responsible for the losses. On 8 September, the eight municipal councils involved unanimously voted to hold DnB NOR and Depfa Bank liable for their losses, by issuing loans that were illegal according to the Municipality Act. The municipalities will no longer honour the loan commitments, and stop payments. Kjell-Idar Juvik claimed he hoped the banks would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> the matter, and hoped to avoid legal proceedings, but said that municipalities would not hesitate to bring the matter to court. DnB Nor announced that following day that they are considering taking legal action against the municipalities {{to force them to}} continue payments.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace.

The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. The Preliminary Treaty of Peace and Armistice Conditions between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October, and the armistice went into effect on 18 October. Ratifications were exchanged at Liepāja on 2 November. Long negotiations of the final peace treaty ensued.|$|E

5000|$|Liberal {{criticism}} typically {{does not}} work well, when {{the interests of the}} people concerned are mutually exclusive, and cannot be reconciled at all.

25|$|Even as {{tensions}} lessened {{and leaders}} {{on both sides}} adopted more conciliatory attitudes, the border issue remained unresolved. Despite {{their view of the}} previous border treaties as unequal ones, Chinese leaders were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> {{on the basis of the}} modern boundaries. That left about 35,000km² of territory in dispute, with about 28,000km² in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, 6,000km² elsewhere along the western border, and about 1,000km² along the Argun, Amur, and Ussuri rivers on the eastern border. Border negotiations were eventually resumed in 1987 at Mikhail Gorbachev's initiation. An agreement was reached on the eastern portion of the border on May 16, 1991, several months before the final dissolution of the USSR. Russia inherited most of the former Sino-Soviet border, and ratified the agreement in February 1992, while the other post-Soviet republics negotiated separate border agreements.|$|E

She drew fire for a highly controversial Audiovisual Media Law proposed shortly afterwards, however. Defended by the government as a reform intended to fragment ownership of media companies so as to encourage plurality of opinion, the bill was criticised by part of the opposition {{as a means to}} silence voices critical of the government, especially those in the Clarín media group (the country's largest). However, a significant amount of opposing congressmen voted in favor of the law, as they considered it was clearly an improvement on the existing one; also, the government had been <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> and modify parts of the proposed new law to improve it.|$|E
25|$|Governor Lyttelton {{appealed for}} help to Jeffrey Amherst, the British {{commander}} in North America. Amherst sent Archibald Montgomerie with an army of 1,300 to 1,500 troops including 400 in four companies of the Royal Scots and a 700-man battalion of the Montgomerie's Highlanders to South Carolina. His second in command was Major James Grant. The regulars were joined by some 300 mounted Carolina rangers, in seven troops, and 100 militia as well a party of 40 to 50 Catawba warriors. The goal of the expedition was to subdue the Cherokee by razing their towns and crops, while relieving those posts invested by the Cherokee, in particular, Fort Loudoun. In late May the British had reached Fort Ninety-Six, Montgomerie's campaign razed some of the Cherokee Lower Towns, including Keowee, Estatoe and Sugar Town, killing or capturing around 100 Indians. He then relieved Fort Prince George offering to parley with the Cherokee who, having retreated to the Middle Towns, were no longer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>negotiate.</b>|$|E
