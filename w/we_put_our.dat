500|$|Simpson {{looked to}} herself for {{inspiration}} when writing [...] "Little Miss Obsessive", which chronicles the [...] "ostensibly aural dance" [...] {{of a couple}} [...] "who break up to make up – and like it". Of the song's concept, Simpson commented: [...] "It's what we can all become in a relationship sometimes. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> foot in our mouths and we wish we didn't — 'No, I didn't mean to say it. I take it back. I take it back.'" [...] According to Simpson, the song [...] "kind of relates to the last album , but it grew with the new record. And every girl has gone through that situation. You put your foot in your mouth and you go, 'Wait, why did I do that?' We're on our phones writing and texting too much!" ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E

Known alternatively as the [...] "Northern Program", [...] "The Carmel Plan", [...] "The Massada Plan" [...] and the [...] "Musa Dagh Plan", it was envisioned as a bastion against Nazi incursions, to hold out {{for at least three}} to four months. Meri Batz, {{one of the leaders of}} the Jewish militias who had also read the novel, stated that the community wished to [...] "turn Carmel into the Musa Dagh of Palestinian Jewry[...] [...] [...] <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> faith in the power of the Jewish 'Musa Dagh' and were determined to hold out for at least three to four months." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 September 2012, it was {{announced}} that the band would release Weapon of Choice, a [...] "prequel" [...] album to accompany the band's latest album, Choice of Weapon. The digital-only release, available exclusively on iTunes for two months only beginning 16 October, features the songs that were ultimately included in [...] "Choice Of Weapon" [...] at an earlier stage of development. Explaining the motivations behind the release, singer Ian Astbury said that [...] "These songs were turned over and over, forged in long rehearsals and writing sessions, and emanated from challenges both personal and professional. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> guts into this; [...] Goss was able to create an environment where the songs were born through playing and turning over lyrics, through hard work and intense sessions." [...] Astbury added [...] "These songs have an integrity and rawness of their own. In many ways it's a different album to the one we released and reveals the foundations of 'Choice Of Weapon'. We were able to close the doors and begin to explore spaces we had not been in for a while." [...] The song [...] "Twisted and Bleeding" [...] was made available for free download at the band's website ahead of the full digital release.|$|E
2500|$|Lynn {{released}} her first Decca single, [...] "Success," [...] in 1962, {{and it went}} straight to #6, beginning a string of Top 10 singles that would run {{through the rest of}} the decade and throughout the next. She was a hard honky-tonk singer for the first half of the 1960s and rarely strayed from the genre. During this time, Lynn soon began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as [...] "Before I'm Over You", which peaked at No.4, followed by [...] "Wine, Women and Song," [...] which peaked at No.3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with Ernest Tubb. Their lead single, [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be", peaked within the Top 15. Together, the pair recorded two more albums, [...] "Singin' Again" [...] (1967) and [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Our</b> Heads Together" [...] (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, [...] "Happy Birthday", [...] "Blue Kentucky Girl" [...] (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the 1970s by Emmylou Harris), and [...] "The Home You're Tearing Down". Lynn's label issued two albums that year, [...] "Songs from My Heart" [...] and [...] "Blue Kentucky Girl". While most were Top 10 Country hits, none reached #1.|$|E
2500|$|The Razors Edge was {{recorded}} at Windmill Road Studios in Dublin, Ireland and Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser and produced by Bruce Fairbairn, {{who had previously}} worked with Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. [...] According to the book AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, George Young was involved early on but had to bow out because of personal issues. [...] Lead singer Brian Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases (In a 1995 interview, Johnson told Guitar World that he was relieved at not {{having to deal with}} the pressure of writing the lyrics anymore). The instantly recognizable opening riff to [...] "Thunderstruck" [...] features Young alternating between fretted notes and playing the open string. [...] In a 1993 interview with Guitar Worlds Alan Di Perna, the guitarist recalls, [...] "I was just fiddling with my left hand when I came up with that riff; I played it more by accident than anything. [...] I thought, 'not bad,' and put it on a tape. [...] That's how me and Malcolm generally work. [...] <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>our</b> ideas down on tape and play them for one another." [...] He expanded in greater detail in the liner notes of the 2003 re-release of The Razor's Edge: ...|$|E

Clothes, like art, music and architecture, are a reflection of the time in which they are created. Yet in comparison - particularly with that other design discipline that accommodates the body, architecture - fashion trails way behind".|$|R
