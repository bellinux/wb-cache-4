500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men who came before them."

She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps.

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context.
