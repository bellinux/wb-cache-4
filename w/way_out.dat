5|$|No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> is a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, produced by WWE, {{a professional}} wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1998 as an In Your House event in February of that year and in 2000 was made an annual pay-per-view event for WWE. After the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand in 2004, being produced every February. In April 2007, following WrestleMania 23, brand-exclusive pay-per-view events ceased being held, {{with the last of}} which being the SmackDown-exclusive No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> 2007. After the event included two Elimination Chamber matches in 2008 and 2009, No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> was replaced by WWE Elimination Chamber the following year. The name was revived for the June 2012 pay-per-view event.|$|E

5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out.</b> In the weeks preceding No <b>Way</b> <b>Out,</b> Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out,</b> earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E

40|$|Two {{plausible}} claims {{seem to be}} {{inconsistent with}} each other. One {{is the idea that}} if one reasonably believes that one ought to fi, then indeed, on pain of acting irrationally, one ought to fi. The other is the view that we are fallible with respect to our beliefs about what we ought to do. Ewing’s Problem is how to react to this apparent inconsistency. I reject two easy <b>ways</b> <b>out.</b> One is Ewing’s own solution to his problem, which is to introduce two different notions of ought. The other is the view that Ewing’s Problem rests on a simple confusion regarding the scope of the ought-operator. Then, I discuss two hard <b>ways</b> <b>out,</b> which I label objectivism and subjectivism, and for which G. E. Moore and Bishop Butler are introduced as historical witnesses. These are hard <b>ways</b> <b>out</b> because both of these views have strong counterintuitive consequences. After explaining why Ewing’s Problem is so difficult, I show that there is conceptual room in-between Moore and Butler, but I remain sceptical whether Ewing’s Problem is solvable within a realist framework of normative facts...|$|R

5|$|After {{winning a}} 15-man battle royal (a match in which {{participants}} are eliminated until one person remains as the winner) on the January 29, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, Eddie Guerrero {{earned the right to}} challenge for the WWE Championship at No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> against the champion, Brock Lesnar in a standard wrestling match, also known as a singles match. Outside the storyline with Guerrero, Lesnar was involved in a staged rivalry with Goldberg, a member of the Raw program. The feud between Lesnar and Goldberg began at the Royal Rumble, WWE's previous pay-per-view event which involved both brands. Lesnar interfered in the Royal Rumble match, a 30-man battle royal, attacking and eliminating Goldberg from the match. On the week of January 26, 2004, Lesnar and Goldberg conducted promotional in-ring segments on respective episodes of Raw and SmackDown!, in which they insulted each other. The following week on an episode of Raw, {{as a result of the}} rivalry extending between the two programs, General Manager Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No <b>Way</b> <b>Out</b> by giving him a front-row ticket. That Thursday on SmackDown!, the storyline between Guerrero and Lesnar was enhanced when they began a brawl after an in-ring interview segment.|$|E
