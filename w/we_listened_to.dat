He made me sing it for him a few times until he had the gist of it, then reworked it into 'Chimes of Freedom.' Her version was better." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{array of}} {{influences}} mostly include alternative rock and emo bands Superchunk, Jawbox, Sunny Day Real Estate, the Flaming Lips, Fugazi, and Pavement. Additional artists {{that inspired the}} band includes Braid and The Rentals, Elvis Costello, Pixies, Tom Waits, Ben Folds, the Weakerthans, Poster Children, the Carpenters, and the Cardigans. AllMusic additionally credits bands such as Weezer and the Get Up Kids as influences, among others. Pierre quoted Waits that [...] "all anybody ever does is imitate their favorite artist—badly," [...] adding, [...] "we're just regurgitating all the crap <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> in the late '80s and early '90s, the music that got us into playing music in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Kiss You" [...] {{was chosen}} as the second US single and third {{international}} from their second studio album, Take Me Home. Liam Payne, a group member, in a November 2012 interview with MTV News, explained why they chose [...] "Kiss You" [...] as the album's second single in the US. Payne was quoted as saying: [...] "With the album, that's the first one that <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> and we were like, 'Yeah, we love this song'". According to a MTV News article, the number was released digitally in the United States on 17 November 2012. By 18 January 2013, the song had not been officially promoted to US radio stations. The track, however, was released by Sony Music Entertainment on 8 February 2013, as the record's second single in Germany.|$|E

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes.

500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E

There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were [...] "arranging for 'immoral contacts'." [...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention to us that <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> and accepted everything they said, {{no matter how bad}} it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|The third single, [...] "All My Life", was {{released}} on March 17, 1998, and was the duo's most successful song. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, [...] "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A Records. But <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> it after {{we got out of}} the studio and it was like, 'I'm keeping this, this is too hot. [...] "All My Life" [...] peaked at number one on the Hot 100 and R/Hip-Hop Songs, tying a record set by The Beatles by jumping from 15th to first on the U.S. charts. It was also a number-one song in Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. It peaked at second on the Norwegian Singles Chart, third on the Flanders Belgium Singles Chart, fourth on the Swedish Singles Chart and the Swiss Singles Chart, eighth on the UK Singles Chart, 11th on the Wallonia Belgium Singles Chart, 12th on the Austrian Singles Chart, and 43rd on the French Singles Chart.

Compared to their previous albums in the US, Pet Sounds achieved dramatically less commercial success; it peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard LP chart, with sales estimated at around 500,000 units.

2500|$|The Backstreet Boys {{have always}} prided {{themselves}} as a vocal harmony group and not a boy band. In order to fight the boy band stereotype and the backlash from New Kids on the Block's lip-sync scandal in the beginning, they sing a cappella every chance they get. The ad they answered in 1993 was for a singing group with [...] "New Kids on the Block look with a Boyz II Men sound", and they aimed to have a white version of Boyz II Men. [...] "We were fans of New Kids, but were we really modeled after them? No. We looked at ourselves as Shai, Jodeci, Boyz II Men, the true vocal groups. That's who <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> and who {{we really wanted to}} be like," [...] Littrell stated in 2011. The Backstreet Boys often employ polyphonic harmony, which sets them apart from many other singing groups. In choruses, Littrell, Carter, and McLean usually sing the melody with Dorough harmonizing above the melody and Richardson covering the bass parts. [...] During Richardson's absence, McLean and Carter together covered his part in choruses while Dorough took his solo parts, although McLean sang Richardson's verse in [...] "Drowning".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the eight}} players who had refused the {{contracts}} {{offered by the}} board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,"It's a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. We met with these players as we promised we would, <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run {{until the end of}} the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute.

2500|$|A {{majority}} of the band's previous material was written by former guitarist Ryan Ross. For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself. But it ended up being great, and I’m glad {{that we were able to}} figure out what we wanted to write about." [...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and messing around with them.

2500|$|The band {{released}} several {{songs for}} War Child compilations. In 2002 Elbow recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Something in the Air" [...] for the compilation 1 Love.

The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'. For 'Heroes' we've changed the order of things but kept every musical theme in the song. We wrote it with the members of U2 in mind. War Child do exactly what it says on the tin. These kids shouldn't be in such circumstances in the first place, but they are, so thank god someone's doing something about it".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, Fallon Bowman left Kittie.

On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed.

Therefore, we hypothesized that, although sad music is perceived as sad, listeners actually feel (experience) pleasant emotions concurrent with sadness. This hypothesis was supported, which led us to question whether sadness in the context of art is truly an unpleasant emotion. While experiencing sadness may be unpleasant, it may also be somewhat pleasant when experienced in the context of art, for example, when <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> sad music. <b>We</b> consider musically evoked emotion vicarious, as we are not threatened when we experience it, in the way that we can be during the course of experiencing emotion in daily life.
