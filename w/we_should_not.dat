25|$|We {{classify}} {{other animals}} and living beings as nature, {{acting as if}} we ourselves {{are not part of}} it. Then we pose the question ‘How should we deal with Nature?’ We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> harm ourselves; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.|$|E
25|$|God expects us to rule {{this country}} because {{we are the only}} {{organisation}} which was blessed by pastors when it was formed. It is even blessed in Heaven. That is why we will rule until Jesus comes back. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> allow anyone to govern our city when we are ruling the country.|$|E
25|$|We judge that, in the {{prosecution}} of these and all such witchcrafts, there is need of a very critical and exquisite caution, lest by too much credulity for things received only upon the Devil's authority, there be a door opened for a long train of miserable consequences, and Satan get an advantage over us; for <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be ignorant of his devices.|$|E

25|$|In early Rome {{agriculture}} and military activity were closely bound up, {{in the sense}} that the Roman farmer was also a soldier. … In the case of the October Horse, for example, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be trying to decide whether it is a military, or an agricultural festival; but see it rather as one of the ways in which the convergence of farming and warfare (or more accurately of farmers and fighters) might be expressed.|$|E
25|$|New Media as Faster Execution of Algorithms Previously Executed Manually {{or through}} Other Technologies Computers are a huge speed-up of what were {{previously}} manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically {{speeding up the}} execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.|$|E
25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, {{this is similar to}} arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.|$|E

25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> limit our ethical consideration {{to the interests of}} human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
25|$|Catherine Hills {{suggests}} {{it is not}} necessary to see all the early settlers as federate troops, and that this interpretation has been used rather too readily by some archaeologists. A variety of relationships could have existed between Romano-British and incoming Anglo-Saxons. The broader archaeological picture suggests that no one model will explain all the Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain and that there was considerable regional variation. Settlement density varied within southern and eastern England. Norfolk has more large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries than the neighbouring East Anglian county of Suffolk; eastern Yorkshire (the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira) far more than the rest of Northumbria. The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later Viking settlers, may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.|$|E
50|$|The world-systems theory {{stresses}} that world-systems (and <b>not</b> nation states) <b>should</b> be the basic unit of social analysis. Thus <b>we</b> <b>should</b> focus <b>not</b> on individual states, {{but on the}} relations between their groupings (core, semi-periphery, and periphery).|$|R

Wenger said of Walcott: [...] "…he had a very good performance and scored a great goal. That is good for us and good news for England." [...] Gilberto Silva described Arsenal’s defeat as a “sad memory” and wanted to use the loss to motivate the team for their coming matches.|$|E

Davidson concludes that, in these examples, [...] "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention." ...|$|E
