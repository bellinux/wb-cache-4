Diameter distribution models were developed for even-aged Douglas-fir stands, 20 to 40 years old, in Oregon and Washington. In order to test if the two-parameter <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> can adequately describe the diameter distributions of such stands, maximum likelihood estimated parameters of the two parameter <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> were compared with observed diameter distributions. Two sets of models were developed. The first set of models predicted the diameter distributions of unthinned forest stands from stand variables. Models were developed to predict {{each of the two}} parameters of the <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> from stand variables. The <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> with the two estimated parameters became the diameter distribution model for the stand. The second set of models predicted the growth of a stand of trees after thinning. A Weibull diameter distribution model was developed for a forest stand after a growth period. The parameters of the <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> were estimated from stand variables {{at the beginning of the}} growth period and the length of the growth period. Results showed that the two-parameter <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> can describe the diameter distributions of even-aged stands of Douglas-fir, 20 to 40 years old, in Oregon and Washington. The diameter distribution model for unthinned stands predicted the observed diameter distributions in an independent data set quite well. The diameter distribution model for a thinned stand after a growth period gave a satisfactory prediction for 93 percent of the observed diameter distributions in the independent data set.

In this paper, two other mixture functions are proposed {{for the first time}} to wind energy field, i. e. the mixture Gamma-Weibull function (GW) and mixture truncated normal function (NN). These five functions will be reviewed and compared together with conventional <b>Weibull</b> <b>function.</b> Wind speed data measured from 2006 to 2008 at three wind farms experiencing different climatic environments in Taiwan are selected as sample data to test their performance. Judgment criteria include four kinds of statistical errors, i. e. the max error in Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, root mean square error, Chi-square error and relative error of wind potential energy. The results show that all the mixture functions and the maximum entropy function describe wind characterizations better than the conventional <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> if wind regime presents two humps on it, irrespective of wind speed and power density. For wind speed distributions, the proposed GW pdf describes best according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by the NW and WW pdfs, while the NN pdf performs worst. As for wind power density, the MEP and GW pdfs perform best followed by the WW and NW pdfs.

This study represents a first attempt to use the <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> to define the bioclimatic niche of some trees, which may help in understanding particular adaptations of individual species to the environment. ContextThe plant–environment relationships studied in this work, and the definition of points of maximum probability of abundance, constitute an important basis for understanding species-specific adaptation to certain environmental conditions. The method presented here can be applied to any location.

Methods Literature reviews were conducted to identify RTW curves and to estimate treatment effects, costs and benefits of structured interventions among workers on sick leave due to low back pain. RTW curves were mathematically described by <b>Weibull</b> <b>functions</b> and intervention effects, expressed by hazard ratios, were used to adjust these <b>Weibull</b> <b>functions.</b> Subsequently, these functions were used to evaluate the theoretical effects of interventions on reduction in number of days on sick leave and on the benefit-cost ratio. Results The cost-benefits of a RTW intervention among workers on sick leave due to low back pain were determined by the estimated effectiveness of the intervention, the costs of the intervention, the natural course of RTW in the target population, the timing of the enrolment of subjects into the intervention, and the duration of the intervention. Conclusion With a good RTW in the first weeks, the only early interventions likely to be cost-beneficial are inexpensive work-focused enhancements to early routine care, such as accommodating workplaces. Structured interventions are unlikely to have an additional impact on the already good prognosis when offered before the optimal time window at approximately 8 to 12  weeks. The generalisibility of the effectiveness of a RTW intervention depends on the comparability of baseline characteristics and RTW curves in target and source populations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> is {{frequently}} chosen to define psychometric functions. Tyler and Chen (Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 3121) criticised the high-threshold postulate {{implied by the}} <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> and argued that this function implies the assumption of multiplicative noise. It will be shown in this paper that in fact the <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> {{is compatible with the}} assumption of additive noise, and that the <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> may be generalised to the case of detection not being high threshold. The derivations rest, however, on a representation of sensory activity lacking a satisfying degree of generality. Therefore, a more general representation of sensory activity in terms of stochastic processes will be suggested, with detection being defined as a level-crossing process, containing the original representation as a special case. Two classes of stochastic processes will be considered: one where the noise is assumed to be additive, stationary Gaussian, and another resulting from cascaded Poisson processes, representing a form of multiplicative noise. While Weibull functions turn out to approximate well psychometric functions generated by both types of stochastic processes, it also becomes obvious that there is no simple interpretation of the parameters of the fitted Weibull functions. Moreover, corresponding to Tyler and Chen’s discussion of the role of multiplicative noise particular sources of this type of noise will be considered and shown to be compatible with the Weibull. It is indicated how multiplicative noise may be defined in general; however, it will be argued that in the light of certain empirical data the role of this type of noise may be negligible in most detection tasks...|$|E

A one-dimensional matrix, based on the theoretical assumptions of the derivation of the Higuchi law, was simulated and its time evolution was monitored. Cylindrical and spherical threedimensional lattices were simulated with sites at the boundary of the lattice having been denoted as leak sites. Particles were allowed to move inside it using the random walk model. Excluded volume interactions between the particles was assumed.

In this paper, six kinds of numerical methods commonly used for estimating Weibull parameters are reviewed; i. e. the moment, empirical, graphical, maximum likelihood, modified maximum likelihood and energy pattern factor method. Their performance is compared through Monte Carlo simulation and analysis of actual wind speed according to the criterions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, parameter error, root mean square error, and wind energy error. The results show that, in simulation test of random variables, the graphical method's performance in estimating Weibull parameters is the worst one, followed by the empirical and energy pattern factor methods, if data number is smaller.

40|$|Nancy Cartwright views {{models as}} {{blueprints}} for nomological machines - machines that, if properly shielded, generate law‐like behaviour or regularities. Marcel Boumans {{has argued that}} we can look for devices inside models, which enable us to measure aspects of these regularities. Therefore, if models do produce regular behaviour (Cartwright), they might perhaps generate numbers about phenomena in the world, provided we can locate a good measuring device in the model (Boumans). How do they do this? Models are often understood to consist of internal principles and bridge principles. Both of these {{play a role in}} the measuring process. This paper suggests that we can understand the internal principles to be responsible for generating the regularities displayed by the model - and for many users of the model, this is sufficient use. The bridge principles (following Cartwright - ‘the real bridge principles’) are a matter of picking the right mathematical representation to make the model work with respect to some real world case at hand. These ‘real’ bridge principles may enable the model to generate numbers and so serve to make the model into a measuring device. This paper explores this construction of a measuring device of duration dependence of unemployment. Since search theory cannot be made operational for this purpose duration models, which model of the outflow process of unemployment with a <b>Weibull</b> <b>function,</b> are taken as a representation of reservation wage setting in search models. As I show, this <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> serves as a bridge principle to make a measure of the elasticity of response between unemployment benefit and duration of unemployment. It enables measurement to take place by modelling behaviour according to some assumptions, which operate as constraints. While this <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> serves this purpose, its assumptions are arbitrary rather than connected to theory, and measurements generated with this bridge principle turn out to be highly sensitive to its specification. The <b>Weibull</b> <b>function</b> does enable the model to function as a measuring device, but the lack of ability to make newly invoked unobservable variables operational makes it of dubious worth...|$|E
