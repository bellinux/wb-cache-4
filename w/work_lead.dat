25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1906, Picasso {{followed}} his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Pablo Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's <b>work</b> <b>lead</b> directly to Les Demoiselles in 1907.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Paul Gauguin had {{achieved}} {{center stage in}} the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly influenced by the paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's <b>work</b> <b>lead</b> directly to Les Demoiselles in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, {{in an attempt to}} help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E
