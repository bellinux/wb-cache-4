In order to encourage {{further development of}} inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in this paper focus is set on {{the identification of the}} barriers that limit and prevent development of inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> More specifically, emphasis is placed on the barriers that are preventing the cargo shifting from land to <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> system. Research conducted in case of Republic of Serbia investigates several barriers which are classified in four main categories: goods, logistics, infrastructure, framework conditions. Framework conditions barriers are further subdivided and classified in four subcategories: political/legal, environment, economy, technology. Results indicate that the most significant negative influence on the further development of the inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in Serbia comes from the political/legal barriers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} transport costs of intermodal inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport...</b>|$|R

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels inland waterway vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of transport operations for inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that {{the effect on the}} modal split is limited. Under the most extreme climate scenario, inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> would lose about 5. 4 % of the quantity that is currently being transported annually in the part of the European inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> market considered.

40|$|This paper aims at {{presenting}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} inland <b>waterways</b> <b>transport</b> sector in Egypt. The sector is facing several challenges and barriers to development. Logistics of inland waterways of Egypt has unique characteristics and abilities to be utilised properly and efficiently.

30|$|A third {{measure of}} {{adjustment}} {{is the use}} of alternative, environmentally more friendly transport modes such as rail and <b>waterway</b> <b>transport.</b> Shifting transport from road to rail or waterways is an old challenge, which until now has been hampered through the inability to fulfil logistic requirements of just-in-time or just-in-sequence <b>transport.</b> Inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> is always exposed to the risk of high or low water. While this may be acceptable for bulk cargo, it is increasingly unacceptable for unitised and container transport. As the market structure is changing towards the latter, the possibility of inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> to contribute to the GHG reduction issue will be limited. The railways have the technological potential to compete with road in the market of synchronised freight transport; however, the organisational performance of the railway companies is still limited because of missing commercial orientation. Furthermore, some important parts of the infrastructure are over-aged and need major investments to allow for a substantial revival of the railways.|$|R
40|$|From Preface: The {{following}} research is centred around the Grahamstown non-white urban transportation problem. The bus service under consideration is {{owned and operated}} by the Grahamstown Municipality and is attached to the City Fire Department. It caters only for non-white commuters by operating fourteen buses, which carry approximately 1 200 000 people per year. As such, the difficulties encountered by this transport service should be generally, though not entirely, applicable only to relatively small non-white <b>transport</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The aims of this research are threefold: 1. to establish the environment within which <b>transport</b> <b>undertakings</b> operate, the structure of the undertaking in response to this environment and the problems which such undertakings encounter in their daily operations; 2. by analysing in detail a specific transport service, an attempt has been made to delineate problem areas in both the cost and revenue structures, and to ascertain the degree of management awareness of the existence of these problems; and 3. to determine the social impact of this transport operation and to evaluate all aspects of the service in relation to commuters, business and social needs and wants. Unfortunately, an attempt to extend this type of research to further Eastern Cape urban areas was unsuccessful due to the refusal by certain <b>transport</b> <b>undertakings</b> and government bodies to provide essential information...|$|R
40|$|Future climate {{conditions}} {{are likely to}} affect inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in Europe. According to some climate scenarios, in summer, in the river Rhine, periods with low water levels are likely to occur more often and become more serious. Then inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> carriers will experience more severe restrictions on the load factor of their inland ships, which implies a stronger reduction in transport capacity in the market. Transport prices will rise under such conditions. Some studies reviewed in this paper find that at extremely low water levels, the price per tonne for inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> in the river Rhine area will almost double. These increased transport prices result in welfare losses. For the dry summer in 2003, the losses for North West Europe are estimated to sum up to around € 480 million. Increased transport prices trigger adaptation. Inland waterway carriers may use smaller vessels, and shippers {{have the opportunity to}} shift from inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> to alternative transport modes in periods with low water levels. This effect is probably rather modest, however, with a modal shift to road and rail smaller than 10 %. Also, changes in transport costs may lead to relocation of certain economic activities in the long run. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} affect inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> through {{disturbances}} in waterway hydrology: longer periods with strong water swells and drops. To allow fully loaded barges, {{the water level}} must be neither too high (limited air draught) nor too low (limited draught). Therefore, the water level impacts the load factor of barges and thus the transportation costs. Moreover, in winter, ice jams can paralyze inland waterway traffic on the river. In this paper, the effect of various climatological changes on the capacity of inland waterway in terms of barge transport is examined. The paper focusses {{on the development of}} a methodology for assessing the sensitivity of inland waterway systems to climatological changes and takes into account an experts' opinion survey that provides insight into the perceived likelihood of the different scenarios that are investigated.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that climate change will affect important natural inland waterways in Europe, among others, the Rhine River. Inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> {{is one of the}} main economic activities developed in the Rhine, and the effects of climate change on this activity are of great concern for skippers, the industry and policy-makers. This paper aims to identify whether longer and more frequent dry periods projected in the Rhine River will turn into a physical limitation that prevent inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> companies from guaranteeing reliable transportation to their customers, and – if so – when such a situation might take place. Based on the adaptation turning point approach, we propose a four step method to identify critical time periods for future climate change adaptation. According to our results, the inland <b>waterway</b> <b>transport</b> sector will start facing insurmountable problems associated with low water levels within the time span 2081 – 2095. The adaptation turning point approach provides analysts with a dynamic appraisal method that allows options to be ranked with timing of period of effectiveness and the time span needed for implementation as criteria. This increases flexibility of planning and allows for uncertainty about changing future conditions. </p...|$|R
