[...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>almost</b> equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you have nothing to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>almost</b> trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>almost</b> {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature and against science. We are regressing, going back to when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>almost</b> like animals. The SC had protected our culture." [...] Singhal further dismissed HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community saying, [...] "It is understood that {{when you try to}} suppress one anomaly, there will be a break-out of a few more." [...] This, however, is in stark disagreement with many Hindu teachings because Hinduism does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.|$|E
