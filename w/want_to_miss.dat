He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, and would like now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house.

[...] She conceptualized the shows to consist mainly of uptempo numbers and to be almost void of ballads to [...] "spend the night rocking" [...] and maintain an energized spirit. She also deliberately left much room for improvisation, stating that she preferred for the performances to be very spontaneous, than choreographed and music video-like.
