5|$|After Áed's death, {{there is}} a two-decade gap until the death of DonaldII (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is {{reported}} in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and DonaldII is corrupt in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, {{and in this case}} the Chronicle is at variance <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> king list. According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 09:00 on 11 May, a {{small body}} of cavalry, {{followed by a}} larger body in the distance, was seen approaching Delhi along the road between that city and Meerut. The East India Company employees immediately noted that this was unusual, and the senior military officers present within the city attempted to contact Meerut by telegraph to enquire about the approaching troops, but the telegraph line between Delhi and Meerut {{appeared to have been}} cut. The 54th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, one of three Bengal Native Infantry regiments garrisoned within Delhi's Red Fort, was ordered to intercept them. A party of East India Company civil servants went to secure the fort's Calcutta Gate, but when they arrived they found that troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry had already taken control of it. A struggle ensued which led to the death of a cavalry trooper and a civilian. A small group of troopers from the regiment headed toward the city's jail and released the inmates, meeting with no resistance. The main body of the regiment then arrived, joining up with the party at the Calcutta Gate, and then collectively they entered the fort and attacked the civilians within. A small group from the advance party gained access to the private courtyard of Bahadur Shah II and told him that he should take command of them. The regiment spread out throughout the fort and the city, and was eventually joined in mutiny by the forces of Bahadur Shah II and members of the Bengal Native Infantry who were based within the fort; a widespread outbreak of looting, burning of buildings and murder of East India Company employees and civilian shopkeepers took place, and the Indian Mutiny began in earnest. The mutineers of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained at Delhi until the breaking of the Siege of Delhi in September 1857. They withdrew first to Lucknow, then later to Nepal, where the majority of the men died through combat, disease or starvation. Those that eventually managed to make their way back to their homes found themselves shunned by their communities for their part in the mutiny. The regiment itself, in common <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> regiment of Bengal Light Cavalry, was disbanded {{at the end of the}} Indian Mutiny.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{complexity}} and time requirements, de-novo assemblies are {{orders of magnitude}} slower and more memory intensive than mapping assemblies. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that the assembly algorithm needs to compare every read <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> read (an operation that has a naive time complexity of O(n2); using a hash this can be reduced significantly). Referring to the comparison drawn to shredded books in the introduction: while for mapping assemblies one would have a very similar book as template (perhaps with the names of the main characters and a few locations changed), the de-novo assemblies are more hardcore in a sense as one would not know beforehand whether this would become a science book, a novel, a catalogue, or even several books. Also, every shred would be compared <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> shred.|$|E

The station at Majorstuen was rebuilt to allow passengers to transfer between the KES trams and those operated by Holmenkolbanen. The same year KES realigned {{the line from}} Parkveien to Inkognitogata. This was after complaints concerning noise from the Royal Palace. As part of this the entire line was converted to double track and was taken into regular use on 24 October 1898.

25|$|Jacob Nist, {{a farmer}} and grocer from Philadelphia, {{migrated}} to Seattle {{with his wife}} and seven children by 1880, and initially took up farming. He and his sons soon found work in the lumber mills. Nist worked for three years as a turner at the Stetson-Post Mill Company in Seattle, and his sons found employment as carpenters and mill engineers. By 1888, Nist and his sons Michael, Jacob J., George, and Aloys were all working at the Seattle Lumber and Commercial Company, which was operating 20 hours per day, and had added a new box factory.

25|$|The most {{important}} advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The {{cost of doing}} classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n2), where n {{is the number of}} atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n2). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ab initio calculations typically scale O(n3) or worse (restricted Hartree–Fock calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n2.7)). To overcome the limit, {{a small part of the}} system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.|$|E

In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking.

Should they lower the tolls on the M3 the government would have {{to make up the difference}} of what is owed yearly to Eurolink M3 Ltd through tax revenue. Thus Eurolink are guaranteed a certain agreed return from their investment and would not suffer from any reduction in toll revenue from either a toll reduction or the planned opening of the Navan rail line. The toll revenue is collected by a private company on behalf of the state as a means to pay the private sector consortium annually for their initial one off investment in constructing the road.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2011, Super Rugby was a {{round-robin}} competition {{where each}} team played <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> team once; a team had {{six or seven}} home games, and six or seven away games each. The winner received four competition points; if the game was a draw two points were awarded to each team. The Rugby union bonus points system was also used, where any team scoring four or more tries, and/or losing by seven points or less, receives an extra competition point. In 2016, the try bonus changed. A team now has to score three more tries than their opponents. The top four teams {{at the end of}} the round-robin phase then played semi-finals – the first placed team hosting the fourth placed team, and the second placed team hosting the third placed team.
