5|$|During {{a series}} of trials between 1924 and 1930, the pollen of Cabernet Sauvignon was used to {{fertilize}} Glera vines (the <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> grape {{used to make the}} sparkling wine Prosecco) to create the red Italian wine grape Incrocio Manzoni 2.15.|$|E
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The phrase Kir Royal is used when <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|The grape {{originated}} in France, {{in the regions}} of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. Plantings in California, Australia, Chile and South Africa are also extensive, and Sauvignon blanc is steadily increasing in popularity as <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> drinkers seek alternatives to Chardonnay. The grape {{can also be found}} in Italy and Central Europe.|$|E
50|$|The region {{produces}} both red and <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{with the}} <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> being traditionally used for distilled beverages.|$|R
50|$|Enologically, Vignoles {{is often}} prized {{for its ability}} to produce {{balanced}} and fruity late-harvest style sweet <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> including ice wine, although Vignoles is also used to produce fruity dry and off-dry <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} grape {{varieties}} used in Burgundy - Chardonnay for <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> and Pinot noir for red. <b>White</b> <b>wines</b> are also sometimes made from Aligoté, and other grape varieties will also be found occasionally.|$|R
5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, juices and smoothies. Typically blended with apple or other red fruits, it is also mixed with {{pomegranate}} and grape juice. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif liqueur crème de cassis, {{which in turn is}} added to <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} recipe {{variations}} around the traditional ingredients, {{some of which}} include hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard or <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> Other alternatives to the main fish can be crayfish and rabbit or mutton. The stargazy pie is always topped with a pastry lid, generally shortcrust but sometimes puff pastry, through which the fish heads and sometimes tails protrude.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. <b>White</b> <b>wine</b> {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
5000|$|Touraine Mesland: {{the small}} village of Mesland, which lies between Amboise and Blois, gives {{its name to}} red, rosé and <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> of {{considerable}} finesse produced from Gamay grapes, and to <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> produced from Chenin grapes.|$|R
50|$|The hills around Cori is {{permitted}} to produce both red and <b>white</b> Italian DOC <b>wine,</b> with the region producing more <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 16 tonnes/ha with finished <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> needing a minimum alcohol level of 11% and finished reds needing 11.5%. The <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> are a blend of up to 70% Malvasia di Candia, up to 40% Trebbiano and up to 30% of Bellone and Giallo. The reds are composed of 40-60% Montepulciano and 20-40% Nero Buono, 10-30% Cesanese.|$|R

5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>wine</b> {{celebrated by}} poets was {{sometimes}} set to music. The most famous <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{in relation to}} a song is probably: Ah! the <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> by Jean Dréjac and Charles Borel-Clerc.|$|E

50|$|Wines of {{different}} styles are produced, but around 90 {{percent of the}} production is <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Those that receive the most attention are <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> produced from Chardonnay grapes, produced in a style somewhat reminiscent of a <b>white</b> Burgundy <b>wine.</b> While both unoaked ("Chablis-style") and oaked ("Côte de Beaune-style") Chardonnay wines are produced, the oaked examples have been more successful with wine critics.|$|R
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>wine</b> can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. Fermentation of the non-colored {{grape pulp}} {{produces}} <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b> The grapes from which <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, {{such as the}} Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes {{may be used to}} produce <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means to}} balance the fat <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is {{involved}} in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, béarnaise sauce, marinara sauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> can be used in; made with a sweet <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of dry <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.|$|E
25|$|Because of its shorter maceration, <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> {{contains}} {{very little}} tannin and therefore little antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking. However, {{a team of}} researchers from Montpellier has developed a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> enriched with polyphenols. This wine niche is now intended for export to Northern Europe, a region that consumes a high proportion of <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} authors, poets, and {{philosophers}} have celebrated wine in general but the quotes are {{become much more}} rare {{when it comes to}} include colour. Authors in all eras have spoken using <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> to illustrate their point. Serious or tinged with humour <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> is present in all kinds of works, novels, poetry, and philosophy itself. The <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> most commonly cited in literature is French champagne.|$|E
25|$|When {{placed in}} the mouth <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> has a balance {{different}} from red wine from which the tannic structure is removed. The balance is no longer based only on alcohol and acidity: this is the factor that explains the difficulty of making a <b>white</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>wine</b> is a wine whose colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is {{produced}} by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. <b>White</b> <b>wine</b> has existed for at least 2500 years.|$|E
50|$|Bentonite has the {{property}} of adsorbing relatively large amounts of protein molecules from aqueous solutions. Consequently, bentonite is uniquely useful {{in the process of}} winemaking, where it is used to remove excessive amounts of protein from <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Were it not for this use of bentonite, many or most <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> would precipitate undesirable flocculent clouds or hazes upon exposure to warm temperatures, as these proteins denature. It also has the incidental use of inducing more rapid clarification of both red and <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{exceptions}} to the general rule of Bordeaux AOC as simpler wines are some dry <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> produced in Médoc and Sauternes, where the production of red and sweet wines dominate. In difference from most of Graves, these areas {{are not allowed to}} use any other designation than Bordeaux Blanc AOC for dry <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Thus, some very ambitious and expensive dry <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> such as Château Margaux's Pavillon Blanc and Château d'Yquem's [...] "Y" [...] have to be classified as [...] "simple" [...] Bordeaux Blancs.|$|R

30|$|Equation (2) is empirically {{estimated}} using several sample groupings. The first {{includes all}} wines in one sample. This pooled sample may produce insignificant coefficients for some variables due to differing effects of practices and characteristics on the valuation of red versus <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> The effect of added SO 2, however, will be differentiated for red and <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> {{due to the}} interaction of the SO 2 and <b>white</b> and rosé <b>wine</b> variables. This pooling has the advantage of the largest sample size. The second grouping splits the sample into two groups: <b>white</b> and red <b>wines.</b> Coefficients most likely vary across the two groups, but this division limits the sample size, particularly for <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
