500|$|<b>When</b> <b>Kids</b> Can Say No! resurfaced in 2014, Peter Walker {{wrote in}} The Guardian {{that the film}} [...] "illustrates with grim eloquence, in retrospect, the {{prosecution}} notion that [...] {{was a man of}} two distinct sides: the avuncular and trustworthy public figure, and lurking behind, the groper and abuser". Walker notes that the scene in which a man assaults his child's friend mirrors what Harris did to his daughter's best friend, and that the closing sequence has [...] "an accidental resonance that would only emerge more than 25 years later" [...] because of the two police officers behind Harris.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Love {{publicly}} {{advocated for}} {{reform of the}} record industry in a personal letter published by Salon. In the letter, Love said: [...] "It's not piracy <b>when</b> <b>kids</b> swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or Freenet or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads {{so that they can}} be 'the labels' friend', and not the artists". In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, Love said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists, and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to [...] "put money back into the black community [...] white people have been stealing from for years." [...] She also cited Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst as an example of [...] "a white guy [...] to express a black man's rage with all the privileges of [...] a white guy".|$|E

500|$|Andrew Niccol {{completed}} a one-page film treatment titled The Malcolm Show in May 1991. The original draft was more in tone of {{a science fiction}} thriller, with the story set in New York City. Niccol stated, [...] "I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It's like <b>when</b> <b>kids</b> ask if they're adopted." [...] In the fall of 1993, producer Scott Rudin purchased the script for slightly over $1 million. Paramount Pictures instantly agreed to distribute. Part of the deal called for Niccol to have his directing debut, though Paramount felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him. In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an A-list director, paying Niccol extra money [...] "to step aside". Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left United Talent Agency in March 1994. Directors who were considered after De Palma's departure included Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Peter Weir signed on in early 1995, following a recommendation of Niccol. Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided {{to go with the}} more experienced Weir.|$|E
