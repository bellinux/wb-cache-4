You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{worldwide}} popularity, {{the band}} has remained protective {{of how their}} music {{is used in the}} media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs [...] "Yellow", [...] "Trouble", and [...] "Don't Panic" [...] respectively. According to frontman, Chris Martin, [...] "We wouldn't be able to live <b>with</b> <b>ourselves</b> if we sold the songs' meanings like that."

After the death of Steve Jobs, Coldplay performed four songs at Apple's Campus in Cupertino, further thanking Jobs for the support he gave them.|$|E

The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a [...] "tale to make the reader laugh and cry– to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable... a dainty dish to set before a King." [...] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as [...] "a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness.

500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy <b>with</b> <b>ourselves</b> and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what the}} song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, <b>with</b> <b>ourselves,</b> with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

We'd started out like anyone spending their {{first time in a}} studio – nervous and naive and looking for success. By this time we'd had loads of hits and were becoming more relaxed <b>with</b> <b>ourselves,</b> and more comfortable in the studio... We were beginning to do a little overdubbing, too, probably a four-track."

2500|$|Solitude {{does not}} {{necessarily}} entail feelings of loneliness, and in fact may, for those who choose it with deliberate intent, be one's sole source of genuine pleasure. For example, in religious contexts, some saints preferred silence and found immense pleasure in their perceived uniformity with God. Solitude is a state that can be positively modified utilizing it for prayer allowing to [...] "be alone <b>with</b> <b>ourselves</b> and with God, to put ourselves in listening to his will, but also of what moves in our hearts, let purify our relationships; solitude and silence thus become spaces inhabited by God, and ability to recover ourselves and grow in humanity. [...] " [...] The Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary includes the most beautiful prayers to meditate in solitude the mysteries of Jesus and Virgin Mary's life, feeling in Their company; it’s a devotion to which is associated the divine grace and that causes an effective change of the [...] emotional and spiritual state.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{celebrations}} of U.S. African-American LGBT identity include various black gay prides in heavily black urban {{areas of the}} United States. In addition, various endeavors to increase African-American representation in LGBT media have been undertaken in the 21st century, such as the short-lived television series Noah's Arc. Despite this, homophobia {{is considered to be}} quite prevalent within the African American community. Numerous reasons are given for this, including: the image young black males are supposed to convey in the public sphere; the fact that homosexuality is often seen as [...] to being black in the African American community; and the association of the African American community with the church in the United States. Barack Obama has acknowledged homophobia within the African American community, and made a statement to the community saying that: [...] "If we are honest <b>with</b> <b>ourselves,</b> we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to [...] King's vision of a beloved community ... We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Simeona's {{death in}} 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored {{a book with}} Joe Vitale called Zero Limits {{referring}} to Simeona's Hooponopono teachings. Len makes no {{claim to be a}} kahuna. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Hooponopono is getting to [...] "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity." [...] To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the mantra, [...] "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. [...] Thank you." [...] It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility, taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life. The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be <b>with</b> <b>ourselves.</b> Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being. As such, it is similar to the philosophy of solipsism.|$|E
