25|$|The stalk (or rafle) is the {{herbaceous}} branch {{that bears}} the grapes. It consists of about 80% <b>water,</b> <b>soluble</b> minerals (nearly 3% {{with half of}} potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste and the sensation of astringency. In the production of a white wine, the stalk does not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins is not desirable in the wine. This is why it is quickly isolated {{from the rest of the}} harvest, either by shaking or by pressing.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used in}} {{the home}} as a type of drain opener to unblock clogged drains, usually {{in the form of a}} dry crystal or as a thick liquid gel. The alkali dissolves greases to produce <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> products. It also hydrolyzes the proteins such as those found in hair which may block water pipes. These reactions are sped by the heat generated when sodium hydroxide and the other chemical components of the cleaner dissolve in water. Such alkaline drain cleaners and their acidic versions are highly corrosive and should be handled with great caution.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{occurs as}} solid white or yellow {{crystals}} with a melting point of 131.5 to 134.5°C. It is odorless, {{and has a}} slightly bitter taste. The British Pharmacopoeia lists it as being very slightly soluble in <b>water,</b> <b>soluble</b> in alcohol, and freely soluble in chloroform. The United States Pharmacopoeia lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 ether, and practically insoluble in water. The pH of diazepam is neutral (i.e., pH = 7).

500|$|Nickel {{compounds}} {{are classified}} as human carcinogens). [...] Accessed July 13, 2017. Edition.; Research Triangle Park, NC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service. https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/pubhealth/roc/index-1.html Accessed July 13, 2017. based on increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of sulfidic ore refinery workers. This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the formal}} {{characteristics}} of this inference alone (All As are Bs; c {{is not a}} B; Therefore, c is not an A), formal logic would judge {{this to be a}} valid inference. Schiller, however, refused to evaluate the validity of this inference merely on its formal characteristics. Schiller argued that unless we look to the contextual fact regarding what specific problem first prompted this inference to actually occur, we can not determine whether the inference was successful (i.e. pragmatically successful). In the case of this inference, since [...] "Cerebos is 'salt' for culinary, but not for chemical purposes", without knowing whether the purpose for this piece of reasoning was culinary or chemical we cannot determine whether this is valid or not. In another example, Schiller discusses the truth of formal mathematics [...] "1+1=2" [...] and points out that this equation does not hold if one is discussing drops of water. Schiller's attack on formal logic and formal mathematics never gained much attention from philosophers, however it does share some weak similarities to the contextualist view in contemporary epistemology as well as the views of ordinary language philosophers. (The [...] "All salt is soluble in water," [...] argument is valid according to both Aristotelian and Boolean forms of logic as Mood A-O-O, figure 2. [...] The issue regarding testing for validity and/or soundness is whether or not Cerebos is <b>water</b> <b>soluble,</b> alone, no matter the use of the salt. [...] One would not want to use insoluble salt in cooking, but such an issue does not effect whether or not such salt is <b>water</b> <b>soluble).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{the decay}} mode and the {{pharmacokinetics}} of an element (how the body processes {{it and how}} quickly), the threat due to exposure to a given activity of a radioisotope will differ.
