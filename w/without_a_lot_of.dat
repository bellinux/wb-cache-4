5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

25|$|O. vernalis can {{be found}} in many {{different}} habitats, including marshes, meadows, the edges of streams, and open woods. It prefers to be on the ground, in open areas <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shrubs. During hibernation, the smooth green snake looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers. It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage. Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding.|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of the second season of Daredevil, Brian Lowery of Variety felt the Netflix series [...] "have already leapfrogged ABC’s forays into the Marvel {{universe}} in terms of their appeal, in part by tapping into the avid fan base that supports pay models and doesn’t need to be spoon-fed plot points. In the process, they have demonstrated that it’s possible to deliver a credible superhero show <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pyrotechnics".|$|E
500|$|Maud Adams as Andrea Anders: Scaramanga's mistress. Adams {{described}} the role as [...] "a woman <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> choices: she's {{under the influence}} of this very rich, strong man, and is fearing for her life most of the time; and when she actually rebels against him and defects is a major step." [...] The Man with the Golden Gun was the first of three Bond films in which Maud Adams appeared; she played a different character, Octopussy, in the 1983 film of the same name, and would later have a cameo as an extra in Roger Moore's last Bond film, A View to a Kill.|$|E

50|$|Rapping {{systems are}} {{designed}} primarily {{based on two}} factors, the internal suspension system {{and the number of}} surfaces affected by the rapping vibrations.

500|$|Writing {{in retrospect}} for Daily Express, {{reviewer}} Simon Gage {{was critical of}} Minogue's lack of musical progression, charisma, and thought that she lacked a [...] "great voice". He stated [...] "There are dodgy tracks and the “voice”, more processed than a tinned pea, does start to grate but it’s still pretty good." [...] He awarded the box set three stars. British journalist Paul Du Noyer reviewed the box set, and complimented Minogue's Parlophone work as [...] "ambiguous pop". However, he stated [...] "There’s a lot of ambitious pop in here, but no conceptual overreach. Not even her experience of breast cancer was allowed to surface in Kylie’s subsequent material: lyrically, it was straight back to business. It seems unlikely such a 20-year lucky streak could be sustained <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shrewd decisions by Minogue herself. So it seems that everyone is right after all: Kylie is A Good Thing, and here is just enough of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wales was [...] "reported to be {{considering}} vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes." [...] "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, {{but it does}} expose a weakness {{that we will be}} working to address", Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. [...] "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that [...] "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate." [...] However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, [...] "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." [...] A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such proposals.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised the camaraderie the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Octave Chanute {{organized}} the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in 1893, during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From there, {{in conjunction with}} his contacts in Europe, he joined with younger experimenters, including Augustus Herring and William Avery. In 1896 and 1897 they tested hang gliders based on designs by German aviator Otto Lilienthal. They also tested their own hang glider design. To open the steady winds, {{they came to the}} shores of Lake Michigan in the town of Miller Beach. The location is today in Marquette Park. These experiments convinced Chanute and his partners to achieve the extra lift needed <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> weight was to place stack several wings one above the other. The idea was originally proposed by British engineer Francis Wenham in 1866 and tested by Lilienthal in the 1890s. Chanute invented the [...] "strut-wire" [...] braced wing structure to hold the several wings together, which became the standard design in powered biplanes. The Strut wire design came from Chanutes bridge designs using the Pratt truss. The Wright brothers, based their Flyer designs on the Chanute [...] "double-decker.".|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the $200 {{needed for}} musicians' union fees, Mitchell managed a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, but mostly played {{non-union}} gigs [...] "in church basements and YMCA meeting halls". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she [...] "worked in the women's wear {{section of a}} downtown department store to pay the rent." [...] During this era, {{she lived in a}} rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird. <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> name recognition, Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer pass muster. She said, [...] "You'd come into a town and you'd be told, you can't sing that, you can't sing that." [...] She resolved to write her own songs.|$|E
2500|$|Reception to the manga {{series of}} Blood Blockade Battlefront {{received}} generally good critical response. Dustin Cabeal from Comic Bastards said [...] "The writing {{is strong and}} the dialogue is very sharp." [...] He also praised Nightow's art calling it [...] "unique." [...] Additionally, he {{referred to it as}} [...] "strange at first, but it’s quickly become one of my favorite [...] of all time." [...] Brigid Alverson from MTV Geek criticized the artwork for being hard to follow and stated [...] "it boils down to a matter of taste. Blood Blockade Battleground is a good choice for readers who like a lot of action and don't mind being dropped {{into the middle of the}} story, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> setup." [...] On the other hand, The Fandom Post's John Rose praised the artwork more specifically the monsters' designs. He highly recommended it to Triguns readers as well as superhero comic reader, sci-fi hero and Futurama fans. Several of the volumes have also appeared in rankings for bestselling manga.|$|E
50|$|Gradually, {{electronic}} {{design automation}} automated {{more and more}} of the place-and-route work. At first, it merely sped up the process of making many small edits <b>without</b> spending <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time peeling up and sticking down the tape. Later design rule checking sped up the process of checking for the most common sorts of errors. Later auto routers speed up the process of routing.|$|R

30|$|As it is {{revealing}} in this review, a critical concern about WAF tests is guessing. Thus, <b>without</b> surprise, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> effort was taken to examine guessing (how and why it happens) and find ways, albeit not necessarily as effective as intended, to counteract it, such as selecting high frequency words, varying the distributions of associates, using semantically unrelated distractors, not letting learners know the number of associates, and using a “better” scoring method.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of Chromecast's launch, four {{compatible}} apps were available: YouTube and Netflix were supported as Android, iOS, and Chrome web apps; Google Play Music and Google Play Movies & TV were also supported, but originally only as Android apps. Additional Chromecast-enabled apps would require access to the Google Cast software development kit (SDK). The SDK was first released as a preview version on July 24, 2013. Google advised interested developers to use the SDK to create and test Chromecast-enabled apps, but not distribute them. While that admonition remained in force, Chromecast-enabled applications for Hulu Plus and Pandora Radio were released in October 2013, and HBO Go in November. Google opened the SDK to all developers on February 3, 2014. In its introductory documentation and video presentation, Google said the SDK worked with both Chromecast devices and other unnamed [...] "cast receiver devices". Chromecast product manager Rish Chandra said that Google used the intervening time to improve the SDK's reliability and accommodate those developers who sought a quick and easy way to cast a photo to a television <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> coding.|$|E
