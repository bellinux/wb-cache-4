The Nebraska Water Resources Center is deeply interested in both {{the past and the future}} of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s agriculture because of the demands which agriculture places on the state 2 ̆ 7 s water resources. An examination of the maps showing land use changes within counties across the state will reveal not only the ever-growing magnitude of this demand, but also its evolving spatial characteristics.

40|$|Estimation of inter-annual {{crop area}} and crop {{production}} variation {{is central to}} the evaluation of agricultural performance and food production at the global scale. Remote sensing {{is only one of the}} tools involved in this process, and in particular low resolution satellite images show a high potential for monitoring large agricultural surfaces at a high temporal frequency. Several methods have been developed in the last decades to use these data for deriving quantitative area and production estimates and at the same time to overcome the problems due to the mixed nature of their pixels. This thesis gives a contribution to ameliorate the exploitation of low resolution satellite images and to develop preoperational systems for agricultural monitoring, especially in countries where the early knowledge of agricultural production can help to improve the planning of food aid interventions. The research first uses a long time series of NOAA AVHRR satellite images to update winter <b>wheat</b> <b>acreages</b> in a test area in central Italy over an 18 years period. At this aim, a SAM (Spectral Angular Mapping) method is applied to temporal NDVI profiles, isolating their information content linked to acreage variation. The results allow the identification of winter wheat area changes for each of the 18 test years compared with the average. Next, the work concentrates on the use of SPOT VEGETATION images for crop monitoring for food security. First, low resolution land cover classifications are used to extract NDVI profiles for agricultural vegetation. Then, an index (CNDVI) developed for Europe is applied to a test area in Eastern Africa with high resolution land cover data (AFRICOVER), allowing the extraction of crop specific temporal NDVI profiles for each administrative unit. The index proves to be significantly more sensitive in revealing crop stress conditions than average NDVI values, as they are frequently used for early warning in similar conditions. Operational applications of the index are presented and further research is discussed. JRC. G. 3 -Agricultur...|$|R

The main objectives of that project were t o select and test remote sensing techniques for improving the agricultural statistics rep orting service of the then Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Although activities were inte rrupted by the reorganization of the Ministry, which later became the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), the training programme of the projects was completed, and interim results had started to demonstrate the usefulness of the approach: in particula r, positive results were obtained by the Marmara Research Institute (MRI) in satellite data analysis for crop estimates. Consequently, project TCP/TUR/ 4508 was approved to allow activi ties to be continuedDuring this second phase, the MRI provided training for MAFRA office rs in the techniques for digital image analysis for crop identification and yield esti mates. A substantial number of satellite images were acquired for study areas in Konya Pr ovince, and these will form a good basis for a remote sensing library and data base at the I nstitute. The work done by MAFRA, in cooperation with MRI, in the digital analysis of Landsat data for the test sites in Konya gave good results for wheat and also allowed for the ide ntification of more than eight major crops. Area measurements and crop estimates gave figures of an acceptable degree of accuracyThe projects succeeded in developing procedures for using remote sen sing techniques in crop-area and crop-yield forecasting.

The total amount made available for each fiscal year was specified in the Act and allocated to commodities each fiscal year using a set of percentages also specified in the Act. These percentages were based on CBO’s February 1995 baseline forecast of what deficiency payments {{would have been if}} provisions in effect for the 1995 crop had been extended. For example, for fiscal 1997, the total allocation for wheat was 26% of total annual payments of $5.385 billion, or $1.414 billion. The annual payment rate for wheat equaled total spending ($1.414 billion) divided by the sum of all individual wheat payment contract quantities for the year. As with other program commodities, an individual farm’s payment quantity equaled the farm’s program payment yield multiplied by 85% of the farm’s <b>wheat</b> contract <b>acreage.</b> Program yields under the 1996 Act were determined {{in the same manner as}} under the 1949 Act for 1995 crops. An individual farmer’s PFC payment was the payment quantity times the annual payment rate. The payment was made by September 30 of each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2002. Producers also could choose to receive 50% of the contract payment in December or January of the fiscal year. Farmers had near total planting flexibility on the contract acres (the exception being fruits and vegetables) as well as on the remainder of the farm.

A significant portion of pearl millet grain is also used for non-food purposes such as poultry and cattle feed and alcohol extraction. Pearl millet improvement research in India is coordinated through the All India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project (AICPMIP) under the aegis of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Enormous accomplishments have been made in pearl millet improvement during the last 25 years. This chapter presents an overview of achievements in genetic improvement, cultural practices, disease and insect-pest management, seed production and value addition. Germplasm from diverse genetic backgrounds and breeding materials with adequate disease resistance have been utilized in hybrid parental line breeding programmes leading towards development of hybrids with good adaptation to diverse production environments. During the last 25 years, a total of 115 improved cultivars were released, which provided a wider cultivar choice to farmers in various agro-ecological regions. Agronomic research led to the establishment of detailed recommendations for agroecology specific pearl millet zones which made it possible to harness the yield potential of high-yielding hybrids and varieties. High-yielding hybrids and open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) have been widely adopted by Indian farmers. Currently, nearly 65 % of pearl millet area is under improved cultivars, mainly hybrids. A genetic linkage map of pearl millet has been developed, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for traits of economic importance to facilitate molecular marker-assisted selection. Several processing technologies have been standardized to popularize pearl millet-based traditional and health food products.

For research the influence of wind speed and rainfall-separately as well as together-on the extent and degree of lodging, five levels of the severity of lodging were defined based on a combination of the lodging area and the degree of tilting. Detailed meteorological information was studied on 52 instances of large-scale lodging that occurred from 2007 to 2014. The results showed that strong wind's lodging accounted for 8 % of the instances studied, continuous rainfall's lodging accounted for 19 % and strong winds-heavy rainfall's accounted for 73 %. The minimum instantaneous wind speed that could cause large-scale lodging was closely related to rainfall. Without rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in lodging ranging in severity from slight to severe (Level 2 to Level 5) was 14. 9 m/s, 19. 3 m/s, 21. 5 m/s, and 26. 5 m/s, respectively; when accompanied by rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in lodging of the same severity decreased linearly with the increase of rainfall.

Estimates of the long-run potential for ethanol production {{can be made by}} calculating the corn price at which the incentive to expand ethanol production disappears. Under current ethanol tax policy, if the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and distillers grains stay at current levels, then the break-even corn price is $ 4. 05 per bushel. A multi-commodity, multi-country system of integrated commodity models is used to estimate the impacts if we ever get to $ 4. 05 corn. At this price, corn-based ethanol production would reach 31. 5 billion gallons per year, or about 20 % of projected U. S. fuel consumption in 2015. Supporting this level of production would require 95. 6 million acres of corn to be planted. Total corn production would be approximately 15. 6 billion bushels, compared to 11. 0 billion bushels today. Most of the additional corn acres come from reduced soybean <b>acreage.</b> <b>Wheat</b> markets would adjust to fulfill increased demand for feed wheat. Corn exports and production of pork and poultry would all be reduced in response to higher corn prices and increased utilization of corn by ethanol plants. These results should not be viewed as a prediction of what will eventually materialize. Rather, they indicate a logical end point to the current incentives to invest in corn-based ethanol plants. biofuels, commodity markets, corn price, energy markets, ethanol. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 National farm {{legislation}} {{seeks to}} moderate {{the conditions of}} low farm incomes and commodity price instability. Homogeneity of producer response is generally assumed in national models of aggregate commodity supply. Differing conditions of soil, climate, production systems, costs of production, markets, etc., could cause disparate acreage responses to the commodity programs inter-structurally and/or inter-regionally. If national models of aggregate commodity supply are {{used as the basis}} for government policy decisions and If the impact of the farm bill on a given region {{is not the same as}} the aggregate impact on the United States, then national models are not appropriate for regional analysis. The major aim of this research is to compare and evaluate the <b>wheat</b> <b>acreage</b> responses between production systems within Oregon and Washington and between this region and the estimated national average <b>wheat</b> <b>acreage</b> response. Oregon and Washington are disaggregated into five regions each on the basis of general similarity in soil, climate, substitute crops and production structures. First, the occurrence of different wheat production systems in these regions from 1966 to 1977 is measured and described. Secondly, regional acreage response models that allow differential inter-structural and inter-regional impacts of the major provisions for wheat price support and <b>wheat</b> <b>acreage</b> set-aside and diversion are developed. Parameters of three functions utilizing pooled time-series and cross-sectional data are estimated for each state [...] the first predicts the total acreage of wheat planted and the second and third predict the acreages of dryland and irrigated wheat planted, respectively. Government programs have little impact in Oregon, and only slightly more in Washington. The elasticity of acreage response with respect to market price differed from the national average in all cases but one. Finally, the implications of using the national acreage model influenced by the preponderance of red wheat grown in the Wheat Belt to predict the Northwest regional white <b>wheat</b> <b>acreage</b> response is addressed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the constancy of the <b>wheat</b> <b>acreage</b> supply elasticity between 1950 and 1976. A binary variable approach {{is used to}} test constancy over time and over price levels. The results indicate that this elasticity has not been constant, and the paper suggests a model formulation that is more appropriate than the one used in past research...|$|E
