5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, the IDF Shayetet 13 naval commandos {{captured}} the Karine A, a freighter carrying weapons from Iran towards Israel, {{believed to be}} intended for Palestinian militant use against Israel. It was discovered that top officials in the Palestinian Authority {{were involved in the}} smuggling, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> pointing the finger towards Yasser Arafat as also being involved.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{termination}} of the British mandate, the Egyptian army, {{along with those of}} several other Arab states, immediately invaded Israel on May 15, 1948. The mothers and children of Be'erot Yitzhak were evacuated the next day, leaving behind about 90 workers and paramilitaries, around 30 of them women. On that day, two Egyptian companies attempted an assault on the village, but turned back after fire was exchanged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{battles of}} the Sinai officially ended {{the first part of}} Operation Horev. While the IDF was denied its space to {{maneuver}} in the Sinai against the Egyptian forces still on its territory, it subsequently attacked Rafah and encircled the entire Egyptian expeditionary force. However, by this time the Egyptian government announced its agreement to negotiate armistice <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> which caused Ben-Gurion to order the troops' withdrawal yet again, effectively ending combat in the war.|$|E
25|$|From 5 to 7 December, the IDF {{conducted}} Operation Assaf to {{take control}} of the Western Negev. The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanized forces, while Golani Brigade infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed. The Egyptians planned another counterattack, but it failed after Israeli aerial reconnaissance revealed Egyptian preparations, and the Israelis launched a preemptive strike. About 100 Egyptians were killed, and 5 tanks were destroyed, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> losing 5 killed and 30 wounded.|$|E
25|$|On June 11, Israel and Syria {{announced}} that they had agreed to a cease-fire at noon, which would not include the PLO. The cease-fire was to come into effect at noon. Just before the cease-fire was to take effect, the Syrians moved a column of T-72 tanks so as to position it against Israeli forces in the valley. Israeli infantry teams armed with BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles ambushed the Syrian column, destroying 11 tanks. Another air battle also occurred, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> shooting down 18 more Syrian jets.|$|E

25|$|Although Bashir Gemayel did not {{cooperate}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> publicly, his {{long history of}} tactical collaboration with Israel counted against him {{in the eyes of}} many Lebanese, especially Muslims. Although the only announced candidate for the presidency of the republic, the National Assembly elected him by the second narrowest margin in Lebanese history (57 votes out of 92) on August 23, 1982; most Muslim members of the Assembly boycotted the vote. Nine days before he was due to take office, Gemayel was assassinated along with twenty-five others in an explosion at the Kataeb party headquarters in Beirut's Christian neighborhood of Achrafieh on September 14, 1982.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the breach, the Israeli commander, Shimon Forsher, ordered all {{residents}} to retreat to an inner defensive perimeter. At this stage, the Egyptians took control of another line of structures, and entered a stalemate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> about 30m away from the inner perimeter. At 10:40 Be'erot Yitzhak reported that its fences had been breached from three directions and were within range of hand grenades. The Israeli commander was wounded, and his deputy was killed. In a battle for the nursery school, an Israeli PIAT managed to drive out the Egyptian soldiers. Another building was also hit by a PIAT, making the Egyptians withdraw. Despite the successful counterattack, at 11:15 the village reported that its situation was critical and they would surrender in half an hour if help would not come. This was repeated at least twice more during the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Israelis {{managed to}} push {{to the eastern}} Bekaa Valley, and on June 24, began to shell the {{outskirts}} of Chtaura, which was at the northern mouth of the Bekaa Valley and served as headquarters of all Syrian forces there. It was also the last major obstacle before the Syrian border, as well as Syria's capital Damascus itself. The Israelis managed to reach the mountain pass {{near the village of}} Dahr el-Baidar, which was the last obstacle before Cthaura. The Syrians fought fiercely to hold the pass, and the Israeli advance halted, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> holding their ground and harassing the Syrians with artillery fire. By June 25, with the remaining Syrian positions on and north of the highway no longer tenable, the Syrians withdrew. The Israelis allowed the withdrawal to occur but conducted artillery harassment and continued to shell the outskirts of Chtaura. The Syrians attempted to deploy a SAM battery in the Bekaa Valley at midnight, but Israeli intelligence detected this, and the battery was destroyed in an Israeli air attack. By the end of the day, a cease-fire was announced. The Israelis stopped at their present positions.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{the police}} station, {{both sides were}} still firing on each other. A few wounded Israelis who were unable to take cover in the nearby {{buildings}} lay stranded on the streets. The Egyptians concentrated their fire against the paratroopers in the building. The Israelis decided to release a police officer to inform the Egyptians of their desire to surrender, provided the Egyptians guaranteed {{they would not be}} harmed. The police officer left the building and told Sarhan that the Israelis wanted to surrender. Sarhan took the officer to Colonel Fathy 'Abbas, head of intelligence in the southern sector of the canal. 'Abbas met both men before noon that day, and was enthusiastic to accept the Israeli surrender and end the fighting, especially considering the potential intelligence gains. 'Abbas asked both men {{to go back to the}} police station and negotiate terms of surrender <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> They were unable to enter the building however, as the shooting would not stop and there was no overall commander in control of the militia surrounding the police station. The police officer, an old man, lost his nerve and would not come near the building. Consequently, no negotiations took place and there would be no Israeli surrender.|$|E
25|$|As the Israeli {{advance on}} Beirut pressed {{forward in the}} west, {{reaching}} Khalde on June 11. Six miles south of Beirut, the town was the last PLO position in front of Beirut Airport. The Israelis, who stood {{on the outskirts of}} Beirut, advanced towards the airport, and engaged in frequent combat with PLO and Syrian units as Israeli warplanes continued to bomb PLO positions in Beirut. The PLO's situation gradually grew worse as the Israeli advance gained ground, threatening to trap the PLO and a Syrian brigade deployed with them in the city. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> advancing on the south and the eastern sector of Beirut held by Lebanese Christian forces, the only way out was on the Beirut-Damascus highway, and the Israelis were building up forces at Ain Dara in the eastern sector, which were in a position to strike at the highway and block any PLO attempt to escape. On June 12, the Israeli-Syrian cease-fire was extended to the PLO. As the Israeli advance halted, the Israelis turned their attention to the zone they already occupied in southern Lebanon, and began a policy to root out any PLO remnants. Israeli troops began searches for arms caches, and suspected PLO members were systematically rounded up and screened, and taken to a detention camp on the Amoun Heights.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, {{less than}} twelve {{hours after the}} Israeli-PLO ceasefire had gone into effect, it fell apart, and heavy {{fighting}} erupted around Khalde. As the fighting raged, an IDF armored unit struck northeast, attempting to bypass Khalde and advance on Baabda, which overlooked the airport and {{could be used as}} another staging point to cut the Beirut-Damascus highway. By June 14, Syrian forces were being deployed to Khalde. Syrian units in Beirut and three commando battalions armed with anti-tank weaponry took up defensive positions southwest of the airport to block any Israeli attempt to capture it. The Israelis attempted to flank these defenses by moving off the road past Shuweifat, up a narrow, steep, and winding road towards Baabda, but were ambushed by a Syrian commando battalion. The Syrians attacked Israeli armor with rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles at close range. Israeli infantry dismounted and engaged the Syrians. Fierce fighting took place, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> calling in artillery at very close range to themselves. The Israelis advanced relentlessly, and after fourteen hours of fierce combat that raged up through Ain Aanoub and Souq el-Gharb, they broke through the Syrian positions and entered Baabda. The IDF then immediately sent reinforcements to the column in Baabda to enable it to carry out further operations. From Baabda, the Israeli force split into three columns, one of which struck across the highway and entered the mountainous area to the northeast, one swung west and took up positions in the steep hills west of Beirut, and one turned toward Kahale, which was further down the highway. To the south, the IDF drove PLO forces out of Shuweifat, but no major battles occurred. The Israelis had now cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off all PLO and Syrian forces in the city.|$|E

This caused discontent among several of the PLO factions; the PFLP, DFLP and other parties formed a breakaway organization, the Rejectionist Front.|$|E
500|$|Before joining Section D, Adam Carter was an MI6 {{officer who}} {{specialised}} in the Middle East. Oliver Mace (Tim McInnerny), {{chairman of the}} Joint Intelligence Committee, describes Carter as a [...] "loose cannon". He is a fluent Arabic speaker and has good countersurveillance skills. In one past operation, Adam worked a case in Damascus to recruit Syrian intelligence officer Farook Sukkarieh as a double agent to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> and stop a string of suicide attacks. He used Farook's wife, Fiona (Olga Sosnovska) as a way in. Fiona and Adam subsequently fell in love and started an affair. When Farook discovered this, he had Adam brutally tortured. After he escaped, Adam framed Farook, persuading the Syrians {{that he was a}} traitor, and Farook was supposedly hanged for this. Adam subsequently married Fiona and together they had a son, Wes.|$|E

[...] Other similarly aligned militias, such as the Phalangists, Ahrar [...] and the Tigers, also cooperated semi-secretly with Israel. This cooperation was later emphasized by Saqr who said: [...] "Lebanon's power is in Israel's power, and Lebanon's weakness lies in Israel's weakness".|$|E
