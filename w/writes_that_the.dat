5|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} scholar Ajip Rosidi <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{vast majority}} of the stories in Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy.

Several of the stories use tropes previously seen in Kasim's Teman Doedoek, such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding, and the contents of some other stories are similar.|$|E

5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive.

David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000–10,000 were killed.

5|$|David Crowe <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SS {{had become}} an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is debatable.|$|E
5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of theosophy and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives {{to become more}} spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E

Husny <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were arranged to be married by their parents, while Dini casts the relationship as a vow to be always faithful.

5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E

5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, <b>writes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis}} on aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of loneliness in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E
