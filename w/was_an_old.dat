5|$|Boyle Roche was born, the {{youngest}} of three sons, to Jordan Roche and Ellen White in County Galway in 1736. His <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> and respectable Protestant family, {{said to be a}} junior branch of the ancient baronial house of Roche, Viscount Fermoy from which Diana, Princess of Wales, descended. The family were also no strangers to politics: Roche's great-grandfather had been elected mayor of Limerick four times. Roche's older brother was Tiger Roche, a celebrated duellist and adventurer.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley lived there, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> barn {{that was}} itself a listed building, a conservatory, a gravel drive, three {{descending}} lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a weathervane dating to 1775. At {{the end of}} the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses.|$|E

5|$|King began {{doctoral}} {{studies in}} systematic theology at Boston University and received his Ph.D. on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation on A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman. While pursuing doctoral studies, King {{worked as an}} assistant minister at Boston's historic Twelfth Baptist Church with Rev. William Hunter Hester. Hester <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend of King's father, and was an important influence on King.|$|E
5|$|La Masia de Can Planes <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Catalan farmhouse, {{built in}} 1702. In 1979, {{it was first}} used by the club to house its young footballers who {{originated}} from outside Barcelona. The idea for the youth academy was proposed to Núñez by Johan Cruyff, and Oriol Tort {{was put in charge}} of the facility.|$|E
5|$|They {{travelled}} with a Baedeker guidebook, but the {{two women}} soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue, Allée des Deux Trianons. They passed this road, and entered a lane, where unknown to them they passed their destination. Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse, outside of which <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> plough.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man, {{perhaps more than}} 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{grew up in}} an old priory in the Leicestershire {{village of}} Knipton and went hunting from the age of seven. She had a close {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Hampden Park was {{the biggest}} stadium in the world from its opening in 1903 until it was surpassed by the Maracanã in 1950. Along with Celtic Park and Ibrox, the city of Glasgow possessed the three largest {{football}} stadia {{in the world at}} the time Hampden opened. In the stadium's first match, on 31 October 1903, Queen's Park defeated Celtic 1–0 in the Scottish league. The first Scottish Cup Final played at the ground <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Firm match in 1904, attracting a record Scottish crowd of 64,672. The first Scotland v England match at the ground was played in April 1906 with 102,741 people in attendance, which established Hampden as the primary home of the Scotland team.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> ferry road {{near the mouth}} of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E
5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> colonial house {{from the end of}} the nineteenth century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Regimental {{headquarters}} {{remained at}} Fort Gibson until March 31, 1869, {{when they moved}} to Camp Wichita, Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma). They arrived on April 12, 1869. Camp Wichita <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Indian village inhabited by the Wichita tribe on the Anadarko Reservation. General Sheridan had selected a site nearby for a military post and Carpenter {{with the rest of}} the 10th Cavalry was ordered there to establish and build it. Some time in the following month of August, the post was given the name of Fort Sill. Civil War Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill was a classmate and friend of Sheridan who was killed in action in 1862.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders of the}} National Reorganization Process, convicted in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, received presidential pardons, despite popular opposition to them. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> request of the Carapintadas in previous years. However, Menem did not apply their proposed changes to the military. The colonel, Mohamed Alí Seineldín, who was also pardoned, started a new mutiny, killing two military men. Unlike the mutinies that {{took place during the}} presidency of Alfonsín, the military fully obeyed Menem's orders for a forceful repression. Seineldín was utterly defeated, and sentenced to life imprisonment. This was the last military mutiny in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August, Lin {{issued an}} edict that {{prevented}} {{the sale of}} food to the British. Chinese labourers working for the British in Macao were withdrawn the next day. War junks arrived in coves along the Pearl River and notices above the fresh water springs warned that they were poisoned. On 24 August, the Portuguese Governor of Macao, Don Adraio Accacio da Silveira Pinto, announced that the Chinese had ordered him to expel the British from the colony. He warned Lancelot Dent of the British hong Dent & Co. that the Chinese planned to seize the British dwellings in Macao. On 25 August, former Superintendent John Astell proposed to Elliot that all British boats should evacuate to Hong Kong. By {{the end of the}} month, 2,000 people in over 60 ships were in Hong Kong harbour without fresh food or water. The ships held European merchants, lascars, and dozens of British families. The 28-gun frigate Volage of Captain Henry Smith sailed to Hong Kong on 30 August. Smith <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend of Elliot from their service in the West Indies Station. Elliot warned Kowloon officials that there was bound to be trouble if the embargo continued against the merchant fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, {{which meant that}} the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns and weighing almost double the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an identification signal and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes did not respond to the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} by noon on Thursday, November 4, 1333, a flood along the Arno River {{spread across the}} entire plain of San Salvi. He wrote that by nightfall the eastern wall {{of the city that}} was damming the water became damaged and then washed away in the flood, {{allowing}} the flood waters to breach and fill the city streets. He claims that the water rose above the altar in the Florence Baptistry, reaching over half the height of the porphyry columns. Bartlett notes that these columns, presented to Florence by the Pisans more than two hundred years before, have scratched lines to this day indicating the water level reached by the flood in 1333. Villani further claims that the height of the flood water in the courtyard of the commune's palace (residence of the podestà) reached 3m (10ft). The Carraia bridge collapsed with the exception of two of its arches, while the Trinità bridge collapsed except for one pier and one arch located towards the church of the Santa Trinità. The Ponte Vecchio—save the two central piers—was swept away when huge logs in the rushing water became clogged around the it, allowing the water to build and leap over the arches, states Villani. There <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> statue of Mars that stood on a pedestal near the Ponte Vecchio, but this too was taken by the flood along the Arno.|$|E
