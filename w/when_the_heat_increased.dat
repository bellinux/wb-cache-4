The ideal limit for these systems is often modeled as a well-stirred reactor [1].

Stable operation is achieved <b>when</b> <b>the</b> residence time {{is larger than the}} characteristic chemical time, otherwise blow-out should be expected. Combustion dynamics, resulting from coupled heat release-pressure oscillations, has been suspected to occur <b>when</b> oscillations in <b>the</b> mass-flow rate, equivalence ratio, inlet temperature and pressure, etc., occur at the same time-scale. The condition under which a combustion system becomes unstable has been expressed in terms of the Rayleigh criterion [2], which states that a combustion system becomes unstable <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> release <b>increases</b> at a moment of a rise in pressure. In the former study [3], we investigated the linear response of a WSR model to residence time oscillations using a single-step kinetics mechanism.

In this study, silica nanoparticles (SiO 2) in water with particle mass concentration ranged from 0 % (pure water) to 3 % is considered as the working fluid within the LHP. The experimental design and optimization is accomplished by the design of experimental tool, Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The {{results show that the}} nanoparticle mass concentration and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> input have significant effect on the Rth of LHP. For a given <b>heat</b> input, <b>the</b> Rth is found to decrease with the increase of the nanoparticle mass concentration up to 0. 5 % and increased thereafter. It is also found that the Rth is decreased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> input is <b>increased</b> from 20 W to 60 W. The results are optimized with the objective of minimizing the Rth, using Design-Expert software, and the optimized nanoparticle mass concentration and heat input are 0. 48 % and 59. 97 W, respectively, the minimum Rth being 2. 66 (ºC/W). The existence of an optimum nanoparticle mass concentration and <b>heat</b> input are <b>the</b> predominant factors for the improvement in the thermal performance of nanofluid-charged LHP...|$|R
40|$|Biomass was {{subjected}} to conventional and microwave pyrolysis, to {{determine the influence of}} each process on the yield and composition of the derived gas, oil and char products. The influence of pyrolysis temperature and <b>heating</b> rate for <b>the</b> conventional pyrolysis and the microwave power was investigated. Two major stages of gas release were observed during biomass pyrolysis, the first being CO/CO and the second one CH/H. This two-stage gas release was much more obvious for the conventional pyrolysis. While similar yield of liquid was obtained for both cases of conventional and microwave pyrolysis (∼ 46 wt. %), higher gas yield was produced for the conventional pyrolysis; it is suggested that microwave pyrolysis is much faster. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> rate was <b>increased,</b> <b>the</b> peak release of CO and CO was moved to higher reaction temperature for both conventional (500 °C) and microwave pyrolysis (200 °C). The production of CH and H were very low at a conventional pyrolysis temperature of 310 °C and microwave pyrolysis temperature of 200 °C (600 and 900 W). However, at higher heating rate of microwave pyrolysis, clear release of CH was observed. This work tentatively demonstrates possible connections and difference for biomass pyrolysis using two different heating resources (conventional and microwave heating) ...|$|R
30|$|Visual {{appearance}} in Fig.  2 depicted the color {{changes of the}} surface samples due to THM treatment with different parameters. It can be observed from the picture that {{the color of the}} samples became darker with increasing CR. The color parameters of all the samples are listed in Table  3. It can be found that the color value of the wood samples significantly depends on the THM process. Lightness (L* value) is a sensitive and visualized parameter for the wood surface [10]. When CR was below 60 %, L* value did not change significantly. However, it decreased significantly when samples were compressed more than 60 %. A decrease in the L* values was associated with darker color. The higher the pressure and/or the longer the treatment time, the darker is the color, which can be achieved by THM process. Diouf [10] found that veneer surface color darkened (decrease in L*) with increasing THM treatment temperature. The color co-ordinates a* and b* were always positive in the case of wood. The decreases of a* and b* mean that the wood became achromatic. The a* value of THM wood increased significantly with CR while decreased significantly for CR 75. The b* value change showed opposite trend to that of a* value change for wood surfaces due to THM process. <b>The</b> longer <b>heating</b> time and higher pressure generate a dynamic color change to a darker tonality in this study. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> treatment had similar wood color change trend with <b>the</b> THM process <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> time <b>increases.</b> <b>The</b> difference between these two processes is the additional pressure for THM process. This indicates just slighter effect of pressure on color modification compared with that of <b>heating</b> time. <b>The</b> initial and final moistures were similar for all the samples in this study, while their colors were significantly different, as shown in Fig.  2. This implied that the moisture did not {{play an important role in}} the change of wood color during THM process. In general, <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> time was <b>the</b> main factor to determine the wood color.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of conjugate natural convection heat transfer {{in a square}} inclined enclosure filled with a porous medium and adjacent to the walls of finite thickness is investigated numerically using the finite volume method. While a uniform heat source is located {{on a part of}} the left inclined sidewall of the enclosure, the right inclined sidewall is maintained at a constant low temperature. The top and bottom walls are assumed adiabatic together with the remaining parts of the left inclined sidewall. Numerical computations are performed in wide ranges of the thermal conductivity ratio, enclosure inclination angle, dimensionless wall thickness, and dimensionless <b>heat</b> source length. <b>The</b> results are presented to give a parametric study showing the influence of these parameters on the flow and <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer characteristics inside the enclosure. The results of the present work explain that the local Nusselt number of fluid phase increases <b>when</b> <b>the</b> thermal conductivity ratio increases, while the local Nusselt number along <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source decreases as the thermal conductivity ratio increases. On the other hand, the average Nusselt number at the solid walls and fluids increases <b>when</b> <b>the</b> inclination angle increases from φ = 0 o to φ = 45 o, decreases slightly at φ = 60 o, and decreases significantly when φ = 90 o. Moreover, the fluid circulation intensity within the porous medium can be improved when considering a small wall thickness, high thermal conductivity ratio and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source length <b>increases.</b> <b>The</b> results are compared with other published results and they found to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{laser welding}} {{has become a}} leading {{industrial}} joining process. Mainly because it has become highly automated using sophisticated robotic systems. However, to make effective use of automated laser welding {{it is essential to}} have a high degree of confidence in predicting the welding outcome. To achieve a desired weld quality, the weldments are normally examined and related to the weld input parameters. This input-output relationship can be in the form of mathematical models that can be programmed and fed to the robotic control system. This work aims to introduce experimentally based mathematical models developed by applying Response Surface Methodology (RSM) using Design-Expert software V 7 to relate the residual stress distribution, weld bead parameters, mechanical properties and operating cost to the laser welding input parameters, namely: laser power, welding speed and focal point position. Also, the desirability approach was used in conjunction with RSM to find out the optimal combination of the welding parameters to achieve the required weld quality. In addition to this, microstructural investigation of the welded joints was carried out to study the effect of varying the welding conditions on the microstructure of the Weld zone (WZ) and Heat affected zone (HAZ). Common materials were investigated in this work (i. e. AISI 1016, AISI 1045 and AISI 304) with different thicknesses and joint configurations using a 1. 5 kW CW C 02 Rofin laser as a welding source and two focusing lenses with focal lengths of 127 and 190 mm. Many models were developed to predict the responses of interest for similar and dissimilar welding. Also, the main effects and the interaction effects of the process parameters on the responses were discussed and presented graphically for all materials and joint configurations. Moreover, by using the developed models the welding process was optimized by determining the optimal combination of the process input parameters at which the desired weld quality can be achieved for each material. Finally, the size and orientation of the solidified structures were related to the welding conditions. It was observed that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> input <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> weldbead geometry and the microstructures become bigger and coarser respectively...|$|R
40|$|Fossil liquid oil {{possesses}} many {{properties that}} have made it one of our primary sources of energy on which modern societies are highly dependent on. With the growing concern of fossil fuels impact on the environment, {{there is a huge}} potential for renewable and environmental friendly liquid fuels. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a conversion method that can convert virtually any type of biomass to a liquid bio-oil, with similar properties to conventional oil, and gaseous and solid by-products. In order for HTL to be commercially successful, the yield of the produced oil must be optimized. Recent research indicates that high <b>heating</b> rate for <b>the</b> HTL process may be a key point to achieve this goal. The present project aimed to study the importance of high heating rate for achieving high oil yields, and to compare different kinds of biomasses subjected to high heating rates under HTL. In this work, three different heating methods were developed resulting in heating rates ranging from 66 °C/min to 179 °C/min, and the temperature profiles of these were studied. <b>The</b> highest <b>heating</b> rate was achieved by using micro quartz capillary reactors with an inner volume of 0. 63 ml and 1 mm wall thickness, in a preheated sand bath. <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> rate was then varied by using an otherwise identical reactor, but with a 2 mm wall, heated in a sand bath or placed in a muffle furnace with air. All experiments were conducted with a set point temperature of 350 °C and a total reaction time of 15 minutes, before the reactors were quickly cooled in a water bath at room temperature. The aqueous phase, solid residue and oil were collected and separated using a centrifugal separator and solvent dichloromethane (DCM). Using spruce wood as feedstock, the produced bio-oil increased significantly from 18. 9 wt% (weight basis) for <b>the</b> lowest <b>heating</b> rate, to 35. 8 wt% for <b>the</b> highest <b>heating</b> rate. Moreover, <b>the</b> solid yield decreased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> rate was <b>increased,</b> indicating that <b>the</b> high <b>heating</b> rate favoured <b>the</b> production of oil at the expense of solids. In addition to natural spruce, torrefied spruce and wild and cultivated batches of the macro algae Laminaria Saccharina were used as feedstock at <b>the</b> highest <b>heating</b> rate of 179 °C/min. Of all the feedstocks used, the natural wood was most successful, and the oil yield decreased to 31. 3 wt% when torrefied wood was used. For the wild and cultivated samples of Laminaria Saccharina the bio-oil yield was much lower between 23 wt% and 24 wt%...|$|R
