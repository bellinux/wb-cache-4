40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>waste</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> {{has been identified}} and well documented in water sources throughout North America and Europe. Many {{studies have been conducted}} which identify the {{occurrence of}} various pharmaceutical compounds in these waters. This project is an extensive review of the documented evidence of this occurrence published in the scientific literature. This review was performed to determine if this occurrence has {{a significant impact on the}} environment and public health. This project and review found that pharmaceuticals such as sex hormone drugs, antibiotic drugs and antineoplastic/cytostatic agents as well as their metabolites have been found to occur in water sources throughout the United States at levels high enough to have noticeable impacts on human health and the environment. It was determined that the primary sources of this occurrence of pharmaceuticals were waste water effluent and solid wastes from sewage treatment plants, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, healthcare and biomedical research facilities, as well as runoff from veterinary medicine applications (including aquaculture). ^ In addition, current public policies of US governmental agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) have been evaluated to see if they are doing a sufficient job at controlling this issue. Specific recommendations for developing these EPA, FDA, and DEA policies have been made to mitigate, prevent, or eliminate this issue. ^ Other possible interventions such as implementing engineering controls were also evaluated in order to mitigate, prevent and eliminate this issue. These engineering controls include implementing improved current treatment technologies such as the advancement and improvement of waste water treatment processes utilized by conventional sewage treatment and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. In addition, administrative controls such as the use of “green chemistry” in drug synthesis and design were also explored and evaluated as possible alternatives to mitigate, prevent, or eliminate this issue. Specific recommendations for incorporating these engineering and administrative controls into the applicable EPA, FDA, and DEA policies have also been made. ...|$|E

Introduction: There {{has been a significant}} rise in the use of medical pharmaceuticals to combat disease and ill‑health across the WHO European Region. However, global estimates suggest that over half of all medicines are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately, and that half of all patients fail to take them as directed. As well as impacting negatively on individual health, and resulting in extensive resource <b>waste,</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> use – and “misuse” – can have significant adverse repercussions on wildlife and ecosystems, particularly when unused medicines are disposed of inappropriately. Methods: This paper examines the rise in medicine (mis) use, and considers what is known about <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> in the environment. While technological responses to alleviate the impacts of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> exist, they are costly and complex, and do not address the root causes of the problem. Results: This paper demonstrates how incorporating a cultural perspective can help us to understand not just how medicines can be more thoughtfully disposed of, but why particular medicines are administered to, and consumed or disposed of by, particular population groups in the first place. Conclusion: Understanding the ways that people’s perceptions, beliefs, and social norms and values interrelate with medicine prescribing, consumption and disposal practice is key to alleviating medicine misuse...|$|R

This work looks at <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> as a source of valuable active compounds proposing the use of novel aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) composed of quaternary ammonium compounds and different salts to the extraction of active substances from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> The phase diagrams of ABS of six quaternary ammonium halides ([N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Br, [N- 2,N- 2,N- 2,N- 2]Cl, [N- 3,N- 3,N- 3,N- 3]Cl, [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Br and [N- 4,N- 4,N- 4,N- 4]Cl) and three different salts (potassium citrate buffer, potassium carbonate and potassium phosphate buffer) were established at 298 (+/- 1) K. These systems allow the investigation of the influence of the ammonium structure, the salting-out agent, and the pH of the aqueous medium. They were then applied to the extraction of paracetamol that displays an extensive partition towards the ammonium-rich phase. All the studied systems, employing both the model compound and real matrix reveal a great aptitude to recover paracetamol from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> presenting extraction efficiencies ranging from around 80 % up to 100 %.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{developing}} a sustainable process for the recovery of valuable drugs from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> using ionic liquid (IL) -based aqueous biphasic systems (ABS). Because in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes,</b> excipients represent the major contaminants, the search for selective routes for their elimination is of primordial relevance and for that purpose IL-based ABS were evaluated. The effects of different process parameters, namely the IL nature, pH and mixture composition used in the extraction system, were studied and the process was optimized to maximize the extraction of the antidepressant from <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes.</b> Moreover, {{the maximum amount of}} amitriptyline able to be processed using such systems was assessed. The set of ABS investigated herein revealed a high extraction performance, as indicated by the outstanding logarithmic functions of the amitriptilyne partition coefficients ranging from 2. 41 +/- 0. 05 to > 2. 5 and extraction efficiencies between 66 % +/- 1 % and 100 %. The best ABS and conditions were considered in the development of an integrated multi-step purification process. The process here proposed comprises three main stages as follows: the solid-liquid extraction of the antidepressant from ADT 25 pills, its purification using the optimal IL-based ABS and the antidepressant isolation by precipitation with anti-solvent. After the removal of most water insoluble excipients in the first step, with the selected IL-based ABS, it was possible to further eliminate water soluble contaminants. A high capability of extraction and purification, leading to the selective separation of amitriptyline hydrochloride from the main contaminants contained in solid <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>wastes</b> was achieved. Finally, the isolation of the amitriptilyne in a pure state was successfully accomplished through precipitation with the anti-solvent...|$|R

During the past 50 years, {{the rapid expansion of}} chemical industries in both the developed and developing countries has resulted in release of a plethora of xenobiotics into the environment. These alien molecules, including pesticides, herbicides, cosmetics, preservatives, cleaning materials, municipal and private <b>wastes,</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and industrial by-products enter our bodies in a variety of forms. Exposure to chemical contaminants, which are estrogen mimics and endocrine disruptors, has been implicated as one of the possible factors contributing to the increasing male infertility. Environmental exposures of the father to the toxicants are linked to spontaneous abortion and / or congenital abnormalities in their off spring. Where the husbands are employed in an industry (chemical dyes, plastics, formaldehyde, etc.), their wives have about 90 % greater risk of stillbirth. Exposure of the fathers to polyvinyl alcohol and benzene is associated with about 50 % increase in preterm delivery.

This problem led to the main question in this bachelor thesis: “How sustainable do Dutch consumers act with their pharmaceutical disposals?” To investigate the factors that influence environmentally significant behaviour in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> disposal, I carried out a survey that reached 203 respondents in The Netherlands. I used several theories to construct the reasons how people make decisions in disposal of unused pharmaceuticals and why they throw them away by household waste or via sink or toilet for example. Included in this study are multiple (socio-) demographic factors and assumptions based on relevant literature. I found that environmental concerned people bring their medication to the pharmacy more often than people who are not concerned about the environment. However, there seems to exist incongruence between the attitude and actual behaviour. Women and elderly people show more sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> Being informed about the possibility to bring medication back to the pharmacy was a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour regarding <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The awareness of the harmful effects is also a significant predictor for sustainable behaviour.

40|$|Summary: The {{presence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} has become an environmental issue. Although human excretion {{has been identified as}} the main factor contributing to the environmental loading of pharmaceuticals, improper disposal practices can also contribute to this problem. In Canada, survey results showed that consumers tend to dispose a large part of their unused and expired <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in regular <b>waste</b> and down the drain. Therefore, a change in the behaviour of consumers regarding their disposal practices could help reduce the environmental exposure to these chemicals. In this context, this paper identifies and assesses pharmaceutical disposal programs offered to the public. Programs identified aim at increasing proper disposal of pharmaceuticals and/or reducing <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste.</b> The main findings are: (1) Canada does not have a nation-wide pharmaceutical disposal program but a variety of programs are established at provincial, municipal, and community levels; (2) across the Canadian province-wide programs, Alberta seems to divert the most quantity, in absolute terms, of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>waste</b> from household wastes and sewe...|$|R
