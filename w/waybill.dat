5|$|Many musicians, {{bands and}} orchestras from diverse genres have been {{influenced}} by Zappa's music. Rock artists like Alice Cooper, Larry LaLonde of Primus, Fee <b>Waybill</b> of the Tubes all cite Zappa's influence, as do progressive, alternative and experimental rock artists like Can, Pere Ubu, Henry Cow, Trey Anastasio of Phish, Jeff Buckley, Faust, John Frusciante, Steven Wilson, and The Aristocrats. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as the Beatles' Freak Out!, Jimi Hendrix, and heavy rock and metal acts like Black Sabbath, Simon Phillips, Mike Portnoy, Warren DeMartini, Steve Vai, Strapping Young Lad, System of a Down, and Clawfinger acknowledge Zappa's inspiration. On the classical music scene, Tomas Ulrich, Meridian Arts Ensemble, Ensemble Ambrosius and the Fireworks Ensemble regularly perform Zappa's compositions and quote his influence. Contemporary jazz musicians and composers Bill Frisell and John Zorn are inspired by Zappa, as is funk legend George Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to {{capture the essence of}} the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee <b>Waybill.</b>|$|E

25|$|One notorious {{incident}} occurred in May 1874 when George Reed of the Mayfield and Heison was fined $20 for mooring his boat illegally in the Cumberland Basin. He {{refused to pay}} the fine. At Lock 74, he forced his way past the lockkeepers who tried {{to prevent him from}} continuing, and he was given an additional fine of $50. He continued (without paying), forced his way through the locks at Harpers Ferry and Lock 5, until Georgetown, where he was served notice for $120 in fees plus $4.08 for the <b>waybill.</b> When he got back to Cumberland, his boat was confiscated until he paid the whole $124.08.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect <b>waybill</b> (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
500|$|Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü, one of Grohl's idols, {{was brought}} in to do vocals in a song Grohl {{conceived}} as a duet with him, [...] "Dear Rosemary". Mould also played guitar on the track, even though Vig's plans had him just singing. Grohl's and Smear's former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic appeared in [...] "I Should Have Known" [...] as Grohl thought [...] "it {{would be nice to have}} him come down and share the experience" [...] and that the song would be enhanced by his bass and accordion-playing." [...] "Miss the Misery" [...] features Fee <b>Waybill</b> of The Tubes, a personal friend of Grohl who said that the frontman invited him because [...] "the background vocal sounded like him". Other guest musicians included three members of the expanded touring band, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, violinist Jessy Greene and percussionist Drew Hester.|$|E

500|$|Candyman, {{recorded}} and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who {{were for the}} most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Peña, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee <b>Waybill,</b> Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song [...] "Red House". The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as [...] "Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys" [...] and sometimes as just [...] "Los Lobotomys".

2500|$|Boatmen {{came down}} to lock 5, called [...] "Willard's lock" [...] or [...] "Waybill Lock", whereupon the locktender would sign the <b>waybill,</b> and report it to the office. If they did not get orders at that lock, they waited near the {{aqueduct}} bridge in Georgetown, until orders came through. A tugboat on the river would pull the boats to other points, e.g. Navy Yard, Indianhead, Alexandria. Some coal loads were unloaded directly in the Georgetown coal yards, using buckets. Coal was also unloaded onto ocean sailing vessels bound for Massachusetts (which brought ice, and returned with coal), a 4 masted vessel holding about 20 boatloads of coal.|$|E

The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and yachts {{disguise}} their tanks with decoration, but the G. P. O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint. The inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy themselves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the <b>waybill</b> over the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. [...] "Pleasant run," [...] says Mr. Geary, and disappears through the door which a foot-high pneumatic compressor locks after him.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe routing {{of traffic}} {{is a major}} {{logistical}} concern for transportation services. For railroads, routing has historically been handled by large, hard-coded tables. Norfolk Southern Railways developed a more sophisticated routing system that takes advantage of network flow theory. Their Algorithmic Blocking and Classification (ABC) system routes traffic commodities (<b>waybills)</b> according to shortest paths. The routing of multiple <b>waybills</b> {{is a form of}} the Multicommodity Flow Problem (MCFP). Since routes for commodities are often predetermined, the success of ABC relies on finding costs that make the desired routes shortest paths. The problem of finding costs to make a solution optimal is called inverse optimization. The procedure of finding an adequate set of costs for the ABC system is known as calibration and is a form of the Inverse Multicommodity Flow Problem (IMCFP). Calibration seeks a solution that makes all predetermined paths uniquely optimal with respect to the costs. The calibration problem (IMCFP) can be solved optimally using the simplex method. However, direct application of the simplex algorithm is not always advantageous, especially for large problems. We present formulations, a primal-dual solution algorithm, and a hot start basis-finding algorithm for deriving optimal solutions. In addition, we can use Lagrangian relaxation to find good heuristic solutions...|$|R
