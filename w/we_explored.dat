5|$|In {{these early}} days <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> {{all sorts of}} power reactors, {{comparing}} {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{began in}} May 1953, with an {{abandoned}} beer hall in Spandau {{serving as the}} principal shooting location. Among the cast and crew, only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley would recall the production difficulties this caused: [...] "No matter what galaxy <b>we</b> <b>explored,</b> everyone spoke with a German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to {{use a lot of}} close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis." ...|$|E

Yorke and Godrich had made headlines in 2013 for their criticisms of Spotify, arguing that it cannot support new artists. Spotify had been in [...] "advanced discussions" [...] with Radiohead's management and label to make A Moon Shaped Pool the first album available exclusively to the service's paying subscribers, and not those listening to the free service, but no agreement was reached. Spotify spokesman Jonathan Prince said: [...] "Some of the approaches <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> with Radiohead were new, and we ultimately decided that we couldn't deliver on those approaches technologically {{in time for the}} album's release schedule." ...|$|E

60|$|I and the {{grandson}} of the treasure examined those cedar-covered hills with {{the care of a}} lady hunting for the wicked flea. <b>We</b> <b>explored</b> every side, top, circumference, mean elevation, angle, slope, and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river.

6000|$|The good {{archbishop}} {{was kind}} and benign, as usual, {{and gave me}} his arm while <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> the curiosities of the palace. Now, my dear, if you will please to recollect that the guide book says, [...] "this palace contains all the gradations of architecture from early English to late perpendicular," [...] you will certainly not expect me to describe it in one letter.

6000|$|Once we {{came upon}} a huge {{mountain}} rattlesnake and Den killed it with a shot of his gun. How we escaped being bitten is a mystery, for <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> every path of the hills and meadows in our bare feet, our trousers rolled to the knee. We hunted plums and picked blackberries and hazelnuts with very little fear of snakes, and yet we must have always been on guard. We loved our valley, and while occasionally we yielded to the lure of [...] "Freedom's star," [...] we were really content with Green's Coulee and its surrounding hills.|$|E
60|$|So {{every day}} the old doctor and I hunted the cure-all plant among the {{mountains}} and valleys of the Blue Ridge. Together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves {{that we had to}} catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling. We waded through gorges and chasms, breast-deep with laurel and ferns; we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles; we wound our way like Indians through brakes of pine--road side, hill side, river side, mountain side <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> in our search for the miraculous plant.|$|E
40|$|This study hypothesizes a {{relationship}} between ethnic diversity and health outcomes. <b>We</b> <b>explore</b> the effects of ethnic and linguistic heterogeneity (measured by indices of ethnic and linguistic fractionalization) on 30 health outcome variables in a cross-section of 87 countries. <b>We</b> <b>explore</b> outcomes related to four major categories of health: 1) immunization rates, 2) prevalence of diseases, 3) life expectancy and mortality rates, and 4) health related infrastructure and staff. Across all dimensions examined, evidence suggests that higher heterogeneity is bad for health. <b>We</b> <b>explore</b> several potential mechanisms which could explain the observed negative effects of ethnic and linguistic diversity on health...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{scholars}} {{have examined the}} influence of actors' sensemaking on context; in this paper <b>we</b> <b>explore</b> the reverse. Employing Bourdieu's Theory of Practice <b>we</b> <b>explore</b> how actors' unique contexts, as encapsulated by their social positions, provide the important "raw materials" for their sensemaking. Drawing on a case-study of three focal actors, located in different social positions in the English National Health Service, but tasked with enacting a common organizational change, <b>we</b> <b>explore</b> how actors' capital endowments and dispositions shape their sensemaking about organizational change. To synthesize our findings, we develop a theoretical model {{of the influence of}} social position on sensemaking...|$|R

60|$|As I {{look back}} upon {{my life on}} that {{woodland}} farm, it all seems very colorful and sweet. I am re-living days when the warm sun, falling on radiant slopes of grass, lit the meadow phlox and tall tiger lilies into flaming torches of color. I think of blackberry thickets and odorous grapevines and cherry trees and the delicious nuts which grew in profusion throughout the forest to the north. This forest which seemed endless and was of enchanted solemnity served as our wilderness. <b>We</b> <b>explored</b> it at every opportunity. We loved {{every day for the}} color it brought, each season for the wealth of its experience, and we welcomed the thought of spending all our years in this beautiful home where the wood and the prairie of our song did actually meet and mingle.|$|E
6000|$|After supper, {{which we}} enjoyed {{as much as}} any meal we ever ate in our lives, we each took a candle, and after {{arranging}} our bedroom for the night, <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> the old house. There were lots of curious things everywhere,--things that were apparently so [...] "old timey," [...] as my wife remarked, that David Dutton did not care to take them with him to his new farm, and so left them for his son, who probably cared for them even less than his father did. There was a garret extending over the whole house, and filled with old spinning-wheels, and strings of onions, and all sorts of antiquated bric-a-brac, which was so fascinating to me that I could scarcely tear myself away from it; but Euphemia, who was dreadfully afraid that I would set the whole place on fire, at length prevailed on me to come down.|$|E

60|$|The {{night was}} now well {{on into the}} morning, but, for miles and hours <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> a strange world, where nobody ever goes to bed, but {{everybody}} is eternally sitting up, waiting for Jack. This exploration was among a labyrinth of dismal courts and blind alleys, called Entries, kept in wonderful order by the police, and in much better order than by the corporation: the want of gaslight in the most dangerous and infamous of these places being quite unworthy of so spirited a town. I need describe but {{two or three of}} the houses in which Jack was waited for as specimens of the rest. Many we attained by noisome passages so profoundly dark that we felt our way with our hands. Not one of the whole number we visited, was without its show of prints and ornamental crockery; the quantity of the latter set forth on little shelves and in little cases, in otherwise wretched rooms, indicating that Mercantile Jack must have an extraordinary fondness for crockery, to necessitate so much of that bait in his traps.|$|E

While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, {{we should be able}} to explore the different beauties extremely well. They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable. When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. <b>We</b> <b>explored</b> to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau.

60|$|The {{discovery}} of Britten {{happened to me}} when we were both in the Lower Fifth. Previously {{there had been a}} watertight compartment between the books I read and the thoughts they begot {{on the one hand and}} human intercourse on the other. Now I really began my higher education, and aired and examined and developed in conversation the doubts, the ideas, the interpretations that had been forming in my mind. As we were both day-boys with a good deal of control over our time we organised walks and expeditions together, and my habit of solitary and rather vague prowling gave way to much more definite joint enterprises. I went several times to his house, he was the youngest of several brothers, one of whom was a medical student and let us assist at the dissection of a cat, and once or twice in vacation time he came to Penge, and we went with parcels of provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and galleries of the Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close quarters. We went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by that made an excursion to Margate and back; <b>we</b> <b>explored</b> London docks and Bethnal Green Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way places together.|$|E

40|$|Privacy {{behaviors}} in online social networks often seem confounding: while individuals indicate concern for privacy, they often share {{a significant amount}} of personal information (Acquisti & Gross, 2006).
