5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart.</b> During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E

In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart.</b> Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{thought they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale {{as a result of}} their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict, and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart</b> due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite, an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate that the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

5|$|During the 18thcentury {{the castle}} {{was allowed to}} languish. The {{south-west}} tower <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart</b> and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt {{towards the end of}} the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop Thomas Percy's poem, The Hermit of Warkworth. In the mid 19thcentury Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, undertook some preservation work. His successor, Algernon Percy, contracted Anthony Salvin to restore the keep. The work undertaken between 1853 and 1858 was not as extensive as Salvin had planned, and was limited to partially refacing the exterior and adding new floors and roofs to two chambers, which became known as the Duke's Chambers, on the second floor. The duke occasionally used the chambers for picnics when he visited from Alnwick Castle. Algernon Percy funded excavations at the castle in the 1850s which uncovered the remains of the collegiate church within the bailey.|$|E

The renovation was necessitated because the viaduct <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart,</b> with leaks and broken concrete riddling the viaduct. The station and the portions of the viaduct near the station had to be encased in a mesh wrapping {{because there was a}} significant danger of concrete falling from the viaduct.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, Number 10 <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart</b> again. The {{deterioration}} had been obvious for some time. The number of people allowed in the upper floors was limited for fear the bearing walls would collapse. The staircase had sunk several inches; some steps were buckled and the balustrade was out of alignment. Dry rot was widespread throughout. The interior wood in the Cabinet Room's double columns was like sawdust. Skirting boards, doors, sills and other woodwork were riddled and weakened with disease. After reconstruction had begun, miners dug down into the foundations and found that the huge wooden beams supporting the house had decayed.|$|E

25|$|As the Western Roman Empire <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart,</b> a Germanic tribe {{known as}} the Vandals briefly took Sicily in AD 467-8 {{under the rule of}} their king Geiseric but in 476 the island was {{returned}} to Odoacer, who was ruling Italy, 476-93, {{in the name of the}} Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor. The Vandals had already invaded parts of Roman France, Spain, and Portugal, asserting themselves as an important power in Western Europe. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to another East Germanic tribe in the form of the Goths. The Ostrogothic conquest of Sicily (and Italy as a whole) under Theodoric the Great began in 488. The Goths were Germanic, but Theodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion.|$|E
25|$|As the Roman Empire <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart,</b> Palermo {{fell under}} the control of several Germanic tribes. The first were the Vandals in 440AD under the rule of their king Geiseric. The Vandals had {{occupied}} all the Roman provinces in North Africa by 455 establishing themselves as a significant force. They acquired Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily shortly afterwards. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions to the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic conquest under Theodoric the Great began in 488; Theodoric supported Roman culture and government unlike the Germanic Goths. The Gothic War took place between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. Sicily was the first part of Italy to be taken under control of General Belisarius who was commissioned by Eastern Emperor. Justinian I solidified his rule in the following years.|$|E
25|$|As the Roman Empire <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart,</b> a Germanic tribe {{known as}} the Vandals took Sicily in 468 AD {{under the rule of}} their king Genseric but held it for only 8 years. The Vandals had entered the Empire {{crossing}} the Rhine the last night of 406 with three other tribes. They were in Gaul until October 409 when they entered Spain where they remained until 429 crossing over to North Africa. The Romans, unable to defeat them, ceded two Mauretanian provinces and the western half of Numidia in 435. However, in October 439 they seized the rest of the Roman provinces, inserting themselves as an important power in western Europe. After the sacking of Rome in 455 the Vandals seized Corsica and Sardinia which they kept until the end of their kingdom in 533. However, they were not able to seize Sicily until 468. In 476 Odoacer gained most of Sicily for the payment of tribute to the Vandals (Theodoric in Italy, John Moorhead, 1992, p.9). In 491 Theodoric gained control over the whole of the island after repulsing a Vandal invasion and seizing their remaining outpost Lilybaeum on the western tip of the island (ibid p.64 and Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths,1988, p.291).|$|E

[...] "Distraction" [...] follows and is filled with hand claps and a keyboard melody over verses lamenting death and destruction. [...] "Do It for Me Now" [...] originated from a beat DeLonge created in 2004 for rapper Talib Kweli, who turned the opportunity down; the Morse code beat was later adapted by the band and stimulated DeLonge's vision of the song being the soundtrack to [...] "young lovers watching the sunrise." [...] "The Adventure" [...] is an [...] "exhilarating ode to a beckoning future with a huge guitar sound reminiscent of The Cure." [...] The [...] song was motivated by a friend whose marriage <b>was</b> <b>falling</b> <b>apart</b> when his wife committed adultery. The situation had a deep impact on DeLonge in that he spent a night up crying {{for him when he}} wrote the track.
