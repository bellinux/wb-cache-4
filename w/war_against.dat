50|$|Comparing the {{situation}} in the Old World and New World: in Spain's <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> the Moors, the clerics claimed that Muslims had knowledge of Christ and rejected Him, so that waging a Crusade against them was legitimate; in contrast, in Spain's <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native Americans, <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> those who had never come into contact with Christianity were illegitimate. Responding to this impeding clerical position, the Requerimiento was issued, providing a religious justification for <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> and conquest of the local populations of pre-existing residents, on the pretext of their refusing the legitimate authority of the Kings of Spain and Portugal as granted by the Pope.|$|R
