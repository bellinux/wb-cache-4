The doctrine had to be challenged and what could the media have done? <b>While</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> argue that some images were in excess, you will also agree we had to report because this fight to the streets". Ending the debate on a sarcastic note Mehta said, [...] "It's ridiculous! The politicians are not responsible, the state government isn't responsible, police are not to be blamed but media is responsible".|$|E

6000|$|... "You can't!... Perhaps, after a <b>while,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{come to feel}} differently--I didn't mean to startle you," [...] {{she heard}} him reply gently. This humility, in him, was unbearable.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{tower is}} but a short {{distance}} now," [...] cried Ghek. [...] "Make haste <b>while</b> yet <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> {{and if we can}} barricade it until the sun rises we may yet escape." ...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR LAD,--That is all right, {{and a good}} job. About coming down, you cannot {{get into}} us for a <b>while,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> imagine; we are in desperate vortex, and {{everybody}} 'most dead. I have been two days in bed with liver and slight bleeding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be too enthusiastic," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield; [...] "for a <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> like {{fresh butter}} without salt, but the {{longing for the}} {{condiment}} will be sure to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, Miss Hazlit. It will {{probably}} be an hour ere {{we come up with}} them. You'd better enjoy the morning air <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> I'll warn you in good time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{good to see}} you an' hyar you," [...] he said. [...] "I was {{a youngster}} once I missed--but thet's no matter.... Live <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may!...</b> Larry, come with me. I've got a trap to set yit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have not}} had much time to see the fruit yet, but now I must speak to you as your chief. You say you have no thought of {{marriage}} till your apprenticeship is up. That is a good <b>while</b> yet. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> change your mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might {{state that}} you {{had heard of the}} Sunset Irrigation Company and thought of investing, or {{something}} like that. Maybe they might give you some information that would be valuable for us. And, <b>while</b> there, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> hear something about Crabtree, or something about where father may be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' she {{answered}} hastily, 'what shall that avail <b>you?</b> <b>While</b> <b>you</b> live <b>you</b> <b>may</b> hope, but once dead, you are dead for ever. Also {{if you must}} die, it is best that you should die by {{the hand of the}} priest. Believe me, though the end is horrible,' and she shuddered, 'it is almost painless, so they say, and very swift. They will not torture you, that we have saved you, Guatemoc and I, though at first they wished thus to honour the god more particularly on this great day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That semi-civilized country, sir, is mine also, {{and if you}} are one {{of those}} who have sought to corrupt it, I beg that you will leave this room <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> with a whole skin. At once, sir!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “My {{advice to}} you is to clear out <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> I have no instructions. There are some of them,” {{continued}} Chief Inspector Heat, laying a peculiar stress on the word “them,” “who think you are already out of the world.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear mother," [...] said Proserpina, [...] "I {{shall be}} very lonely <b>while</b> <b>you</b> are away. <b>May</b> I not run {{down to the}} shore, and ask some of the sea nymphs to come {{up out of the}} waves and play with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to me, Sylvia; let me keep <b>you</b> <b>while</b> I <b>may.</b> I {{will not}} be violent; I will listen patiently, and through {{everything}} remember you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prisoner, in {{the name}} of our {{sovereign}} lord, Ulrich, Duke of Brandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me. Give heed to my words. By the ancient law of the land, except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner you must surely die. Embrace this opportunity--save yourself <b>while</b> yet <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> Name the father of your child!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, pluck it," [...] {{answered}} Aylmer,--"pluck it, and inhale its brief perfume <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> The flower will wither in a {{few moments}} and leave nothing save its brown seed-vessels; but thence may be perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] muttered {{the chief}} mate, as they {{rolled out of}} then-boats and swaggered on deck, [...] "it's your turn now, {{but it will be}} mine before long. Yaw about <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> my hearties, I'll do the yawing after the anchor's up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{the theater}} wait, my boy. My old {{regiment}} gives a ball at Woolwich to-night. I {{have got a}} ticket to spare; and I know several sweet girls who are going. Some of them waltz, Percy! Gather your rosebuds <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may.</b> Come with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know,' he said. 'All I ask is, to tend {{and watch}} over <b>you</b> <b>while</b> I <b>may,</b> to bring <b>you</b> home to Leonard, {{and to be}} Ella's brother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not," [...] {{she said}} in an {{astonished}} voice; [...] "if Little Bonsa, whose priests they are, needs them, and I, who am the Mouth of the gods declare that they should die? Still, she has been in your keeping for a long <b>while</b> and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> know her will, so if you wish it, let them live. Or perhaps you require other victims," [...] and she fixed her eyes upon Jeekie with a glance of suggestive hope.|$|R
5000|$|Shooting {{styles are}} very {{personal}} - whichever 'grip' {{works for you}} is fine {{as long as you}} 'flick' the striker and don't push it.

6000|$|... "Why is it impossible?" [...] Newman demanded. [...] "You {{may think}} it is, at first, without its really being so. I didn't {{expect you to}} be pleased at first, but I do {{believe that if you}} will think of it a good <b>while,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not fair," [...] said he. [...] "I {{ought not}} to keep the book so long. I now give it up for a <b>while.</b> <b>You</b> <b>may</b> let her have it when she comes." [...] And he put the [...] "Dormstock" [...] on the counter, and went and sat down by the stove.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} myself," [...] {{continued}} Count Zellerndorf, [...] "that I crave your gratitude, but for my emperor. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> do much to win his undying gratitude, <b>while</b> for yourselves <b>you</b> <b>may</b> win {{to almost}} any height with the friendship of Austria behind you.

6000|$|... “I suppose you’re {{a product}} of your age, and can’t be blamed for the outlook your {{environment}} has forced upon you.

And there’s something in your look which makes me think that time may come.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Return, then, Mr. Griffith, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> to {{the service}} of our {{bleeding}} country," [...] said Cecilia, [...] "and, after the joint efforts of her brave children have expelled the intruders from her soil, let us hope there shall come a time when Katherine and myself may be restored to our native homes." ...|$|E

Therefore sport, boys, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> for the morrow cometh, with the birch rod and the ferule; and after that another morrow, with troubles of its own.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Cyril {{answered}} once more, {{in a most}} obedient tone. [...] "If {{you wish}} me to live to keep you company in the tunnel, I'll live <b>while</b> I <b>may.</b> <b>You</b> have only to say what you wish. I'm here to wait upon you." ...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the target}} court {{will agree to}} the request unless it violates a policy of the target jurisdiction.

However, a Canadian court would most likely agree to the pre-trial deposition of a witness who could be compelled to testify in the United States.|$|R
