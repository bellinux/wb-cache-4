5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, {{and to try to}} locate the South Magnetic Pole. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross had considerable past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> choice as commander.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|With the Emperor's {{withdrawal}} from the scene, local governors and magnates emerged to claim power. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title for themselves, others, like Li Mi in Henan, contending themselves, for the time being, with more modest titles. Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company maintaining {{that they had a}} right to use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators maintaining that they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Local {{governors}} and magnates rose to claim {{power in the}} wake of Yang's withdrawal. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title, others contenting themselves, for the time being, with more modest titles. Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang. In autumn 617 Li Yuan and his sons, Li Shimin and Li Jiancheng, led their troops south. In a lightning campaign they defeated the Sui forces that tried to bar their way and, on 9 November, Li Yuan's troops stormed the capital. Li Yuan was now firmly placed as a major contender for the empire, and on 16 June 618 he proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|President Franklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, {{after leading}} the United States {{through much of}} the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had {{suffered}} from polio since 1921 and had helped found and strongly supported the March of Dimes to fight that crippling disease, so the ten-cent piece <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> way of honoring a president popular for his war leadership. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison introduced a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. announced that the Mercury dime (also known as the Winged Liberty dime) would be replaced by a new coin depicting Roosevelt, to go into circulation {{about the end of the}} year. Approximately 90 percent of the letters received by Stuart Mosher, editor of The Numismatist (the journal of the American Numismatic Association), were supportive of the change, but he himself was not, arguing that the Mercury design was beautiful and that the limited space on the dime would not do justice to Roosevelt; he advocated a commemorative silver dollar instead. Others objected that despite his merits, Roosevelt had not earned a place alongside Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the only presidents honored on the circulating coinage to that point. As the Mercury design, first coined in 1916, had been struck for at least 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional action was required, though the committees of each house with jurisdiction over the coinage were informed.|$|E

25|$|After the {{international}} retirement of John Eales in 2001, Gregan became the Wallabies captain. He <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> choice {{to fill the}} role, {{as it would be}} a natural progression from his position as vice-captain, as well as the fact that Gregan was a virtual automatic selection for the national team.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, it {{appeared}} {{there were no}} more technology issues to overcome and efforts turned to debugging the system and developing methods for mass production. As this process started, UTDC started its own efforts to market the design. Toronto, the inspiration for the system, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> target, but the company also found interest in the system in Ottawa, Hamilton, Vancouver, Detroit and Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|In early 1955, a United States Operation Mission {{was set up}} in Laos. Its {{primary purpose}} was supply of {{military}} defense materials to the Royal Lao Government; 80% of its budget was dedicated to this purpose. The United States paid 100% of the Lao military budget. However, the embassy staff was not up to monitoring this program. There <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> need for a Military Assistance Advisory Group; however, the United States had signed a treaty that expressly forbade such.|$|E
25|$|Rundle {{was born}} in Mylor, Cornwall in 1811. As the {{grandson}} of the noted Methodist lay minister William Carvosso, and nephew of Carvosso's prominent missionary son, Benjamin, religion, in particular Methodism, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> influence on Rundle's life from early on. Rundle's father kept his family within the Church of England. This Anglican influence stayed with Robert even after he joined the Methodist church in later years, as he still relied on documents such as the Book of Common Prayer in his ministry.|$|E
25|$|Sandwell <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> target, with a {{long history}} of abuses and {{conflict}} and a very small community – back at that point to the prior and a single monk. Sandwell and Canwell Priory were the two Staffordshire houses named with St Frideswide's as suitable for incorporation in Wolsey's scheme on a list of 22 houses, drafted by Thomas Wriothesley, then newly employed to work under Thomas Cromwell for the Cardinal. On 1 October Sandwell was again listed for suppression when the king gave his assent for Wolsey to implement his scheme.|$|E

25|$|The {{result was}} a film {{critically}} well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian proverbs, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.|$|E
25|$|Tancred <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> {{choice for}} the first South African cricket side, {{assembled}} to play the first touring English cricket team during its two Test tour of South Africa in the 1888-89 South African cricket season. While the South African cricket team lost both Tests, Tancred's 87 runs made him the leading South African run-scorer in the series and {{he became the first}} batsman to carry his bat in a Test, when he scored an unbeaten 26 of 47 in the second Test at Newlands Cricket Ground. This innings is still the Test Match record for the lowest score made by a batsman carrying their bat through an innings.|$|E
25|$|A final consideration, {{especially}} for the Great Plains Project, {{was the use of}} methane for fuel instead of jet fuel. Due to aerodynamic control considerations, the fuselage of the RC-1 had to be very large, yet carried almost nothing. This left enormous room for fuel tankage, and the use of methane, hydrogen, or other lightweight fuels was a natural consideration. As the Canadian group was also interested in using the RC-1 to haul liquified natural gas, using this as the fuel for the aircraft (natural gas is mostly methane) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> choice. Methane burns much cleaner than jet fuel, and would greatly extend the engine life while also reducing the need for maintenance. It would also eliminate the need to fly fuel to the northern sites, they could simply generate their fuel in-place.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese's {{next project}} was his fifth {{collaboration}} with Robert De Niro, The King of Comedy (1983). It is a satire {{on the world}} of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping). The film <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes. The expressionism of his previous work, here gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The King of Comedy failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics {{in the years since}} its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films.|$|E
25|$|The most pro-Greek {{power was}} Russia. As the sole Orthodox Christian great power, Russia had long seen {{itself as the}} {{protector}} (and potential liberator) of the Balkan and Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire, who were predominantly of the Orthodox faith. The Serbs and Bulgarians were also fellow Slavic-speakers. These cultural and emotional bonds dovetailed neatly with Russia's geostrategic interests. Supporting a breakaway Greek state, {{which would be a}} natural ally of Russia, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> way to advance Russian influence in south-east Europe. The main problem for supporters of Greece in Russia was that Greece was only one of several issues that were in contention between St Petersburg and the Sublime Porte: others included Russia's ambition to impose a protectorate over the Romanian principalities and Serbia, its demands for control of the Principalities' Black Sea ports, the right of Russian warships to sail through the Bosporus, and Russia's annexation of territories in the Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|After the War of 1812 {{began in}} June 1812, Eckford offered his {{services}} to United States Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton {{in a letter}} of 8 July 1812. US Navy Commodore Isaac Chauncey was placed in command of all Navy forces in the Great Lakes region, and he had known Eckford since Chauncey had been master of John Jacob Astors Eckford-built ship Beaver in 1806–1807 and had supervised Eckford & Beebes construction of US Navy gunboats in 1808. Chauncey visited New York City {{in the first week}} of September 1812 to meet with Eckford and his fellow shipbuilders Christian Bergh and Adam and Noah Brown about the problem of building a fleet of warships on Lake Ontario. Eckford, with experience in building ships in both Kingstown and Oswego, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>obvious</b> choice for building ships for Chauncey on the Great Lakes, and Adam and Noah Brown also agreed to head north to design and build Chaunceys fleet, while Bergh agreed to remain in New York City and oversee the transportation of men and materiel north to Lake Ontario.|$|E
