40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a powerful}} tool in medical image analysis and facilitates the clinical routine in several aspects. It became an indispensable device for many medical applications including image-guided therapy systems. The basic goal of image {{registration is}} to spatially align two images that show a similar region of interest. More speci�cally, a displacement �eld respectively a transformation is estimated, that relates {{the positions of the}} pixels or feature points in one image to the corresponding positions in the other one. The so gained alignment of the images assists the doctor in comparing and diagnosing them. There exist di�erent kinds of image registration methods, those which are capable to estimate a rigid transformation or more generally an a�ne transformation between the images and those which are able to capture a more complex motion by estimating a non-rigid transformation. There are many well established non-rigid registration methods, but those which are able to preserve discontinuities in the displacement �eld are rather rare. These discontinuities appear in particular at organ boundaries during the breathing induced organ motion. In this thesis, we make use of the idea to combine motion segmentation with registration to tackle the problem of preserving the discontinuities in the resulting displacement �eld. We introduce a binary function to represent the motion segmentation and the proposed discontinuity preserving non-rigid registration method is then formulated in a variational framework. Thus, an energy functional is de�ned and its minimisation with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation will lead to the desired result. In theory, one can prove that for the motion segmentation a global minimiser of the energy functional can be found, if the displacement �eld is given. <b>The</b> overall <b>minimisation</b> problem, however, is non-convex and a suitable optimisation strategy has to be considered. Furthermore, depending on <b>whether</b> we use <b>the</b> pure L 1 -norm or an approximation of it in the formulation of the energy functional, we use di�erent numerical methods to solve <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> problem. More speci�cally, when using an approximation of the L 1 -norm, <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> of <b>the</b> energy functional with respect to the displacement �eld is performed through Brox et al. 's �xed point iteration scheme, and <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> with respect to the motion segmentation with the dual algorithm of Chambolle. On the other hand, when we make use of the pure L 1 -norm in the energy functional, the primal-dual algorithm of Chambolle and Pock is used for both, <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation. This approach is clearly faster compared to the one using the approximation of the L 1 -norm and also theoretically more appealing. Finally, to support the registration method during <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> process, we incorporate additionally in a later approach the information of certain landmark positions into the formulation of the energy functional, that makes use of the pure L 1 -norm. Similarly as before, the primal-dual algorithm of Chambolle and Pock is then used for both, <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation. All the proposed non-rigid discontinuity preserving registration methods delivered promising results for experiments with synthetic images and real MR images of breathing induced liver motion. ...|$|R

40|$|Digital image {{correlation}} (DIC) is a surface measurement technique {{that can be}} applied whilst performing experimental tests. At Delft University of Technology, a fatigue test is to be conducted and DIC will be used to measure surface displacements around the developing crack. These surface displacements are directly related to the crack geometry parameters. These crack geometry parameters can be found numerically via a <b>minimisation</b> algorithm where <b>the</b> difference between the surface displacements measured via DIC and surface displacement found via finite element analysis is minimised. Aim of present study is to perform a preliminary analysis before the experiment is performed in order to assess what is to be expected. It is looked into <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> out-of-plane surface displacement information that has {{to be taken into account}} since this influences the DIC hardware to be used during the experiment. Secondly, it has been looked into the noise as consequence of using DIC, and the influence of the noise on <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> to be performed. Finally it has been looked at the influence of the DIC noise on the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>minimisation.</b> Since present study describes a preliminary analysis, simulated DIC surface measurements have been used. A finite element (FE) model of the specimen to be tested has been used in order to perform the study for uniaxial tension only. An algorithm using the FE model to perform <b>the</b> <b>minimisation</b> has been build and tested for simple 2 D cases and a simpler 3 D first before performing the 3 D analysis with geometry considered. The simulated DIC noise taken is 0 %, 1 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 % of the mean measured displacement field in order investigate the influence of the noise on <b>the</b> <b>minimisation.</b> Present study showed that neglecting the out-of-plane displacement information introduces an error of around 2 x 10 ^- 2 millimetres for 1000 MPa uniaxial tension applied. It is assumed that the algorithm used finds the same crack geometry parameters as have been used to construct the simulated DIC surface displacement field in case no noise is applied. It is found that this is not the case in present study. Reason is the algorithm converging to local minima located very close to the global minimum. Present study showed the location of the global minimum becoming less defined when noise applied is increased, i. e. the area in which the global minimum is located becomes larger. Present study shows that the algorithm can convergence towards the target crack geometry parameters. Accuracy of the algorithm as function of the noise has been checked for the full displacement field and the displacement field where out-of-plane information is neglected. Confidence intervals increase for increasing DIC noise, as can be expected. Due to the local minima the algorithm might converge to, it is not possible to draw conclusions on <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> full displacement field should be taken into account in order to have the accuracy required. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to change the algorithm to take extra information into account to make the algorithm converge to the global minimum. Furthermore, it is recommended to improve the numerical model, in order to improve the speed of the algorithm...|$|R
