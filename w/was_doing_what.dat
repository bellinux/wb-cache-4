The division of labor within the household may be divided according to gender and age, or be based on other hierarchical social structures. Human remains can allow archaeologists to uncover patterns in the division of labor.|$|E

This was hardly enough to live on, but his demands were very small and he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he most wanted to. Between 1883 and 1887 these averaged 2–3 articles per month and these articles later formed the bulk of his Electromagnetic Theory and Electrical Papers.|$|E
25|$|By 1830, Federal {{land policy}} {{had long been}} an issue. The National Republican {{administration}} had held land prices high. According to Adams' Secretary of the Treasury Richard Rush, this served to provide the federal government with an additional source of revenue, but also to discourage westward migration that tended to increase wages through the increased scarcity of labor. Senator Hayne, {{in an effort to}} sway the west against the north and the tariff, seized upon a minor point in the land debate and accused the north of attempting to limit western expansion for their own benefit. As Vice President Calhoun was presiding officer over the Senate but could not address the Senate in business, James Schouler contended that Hayne <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> Calhoun could not.|$|E

25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he had to do to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
500|$|Angel is {{the student}} council {{president}} at the afterlife school. This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks to try to explain to the SSS why she <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> she did. She enjoys eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.|$|E
500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.... He would tell us he may never get rich but he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E

500|$|Armstrong became disillusioned {{and left}} Scientology {{at the start}} of 1982. He was {{declared}} a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] (an enemy of Scientology) by the Church. With Garrison's permission, Armstrong made copies of around 100,000 pages from the Hubbard archive and deposited them with attorneys for safe keeping. The Church responded by suing Armstrong for breach of confidence, theft and invasion of privacy. The suit went to trial in a California court in 1984 as Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong. Hubbard's military career was a major focus of the case. Armstrong stated that he had [...] "amassed approximately two thousand pages of documentation concerning Hubbard's wartime career: what he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> vessels he was on, fitness reports and medical and VA disability records.

The New York Times Stephen Holden described Chef as [...] "aggressively feel-good" [...] and [...] "shallow but enjoyable". Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars {{and found it}} [...] "deeply satisfying, down to the soul", praising the [...] "incredible" [...] food photography, the [...] "colorful supporting cast" [...] and the [...] "wryly observant" [...] humor, raving, [...] "There's nothing terribly profound about [...] "Chef". But its messagethat relationships, like cooking, take a hands-on approachis a sweet and sustaining one." [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle opined that Chef was Favreau's best film to date, highlighting the [...] "natural and convincing" [...] chemistry between Favreau and Anthony and the [...] "vivid" [...] scenes featuring big-name actors in small roles. USA Today Scott Bowles gave Chef 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it [...] "a nuanced side dish, a slow-cooked film that's {{one of the most}} heartwarming of the young year". Ken Choy of Wide Lantern noted the structural problems but admitted, [...] "If you ever saw the Kristen Bell sloth video on Ellen, that was me during the entire 2nd half of the movie. Non-stop tears.

500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should imagine an audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E

They were called the [...] "Sensible Spectaculars," [...] {{with the new}} Ambassador billed as [...] "a whole new horizon in size, style, stunning performance" [...] for 1965. The 1965 models were a major makeover of the completely new platform that had just been introduced in 1963. American Motors' new cars included the stretched and more luxurious Ambassadors, {{as well as new}} convertibles for the large models. New styling, the more powerful engines, as well as numerous comfort and sports-type options were now emphasized. Abernethy even switched the automaker's advertising agency to promote [...] "a better luxury and sports car image". However, Abernethy had his critics, who contended that AMC [...] "had its great success when it <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> the Big Three weren't doing".|$|E
2500|$|Wladyslawa Choms, [...] "The Angel of Lvov", headed Zegota in Lvov, {{helped by}} the Church and the Home Army. She {{described}} the Catholic clergy as [...] "invaluable" [...] to the effort, for they supplied blank baptismal certificates from which to create false documents. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski (aka [...] "Teofil"), a co-founder of Zegota, had worked with the Catholic underground movement, the Front for the Rebirth of Poland, and was arrested in a 1940 Nazi purge of the intelligentsia, and sent to Auchwitz. Freed seven months later following pressure from the international Red Cross, Bartoszewski helped Zegota in its rescue efforts. Explaining his motivation, he later said: [...] "I was raised a Catholic and we were taught to love our neighbour. I <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> the Bible taught." [...] He was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations in 1963. As head of Zegota's children's section, Irena Sendlerowa placed more that two thousands five hundred Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes.
