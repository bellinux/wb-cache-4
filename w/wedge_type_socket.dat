40|$|Abstract　To find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher recovery pressure, an experimental research {{is performed using}} devices with {{two different types of}} splitter. Devices with a <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher recovery pressure, devices with a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared with devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two <b>types</b> of <b>sockets</b> of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal wiring diagram (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s wiring diagram changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> system needs its wiring diagram, which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to test nonstandard socket along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the wiring diagram in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the wiring diagram as it has universal wiring diagram, so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked. Also use of other made hardware than national instruments with LabVIEW is described in nonstandard <b>type</b> <b>socket</b> testing...|$|R

In the linear limit the modes are described by Airy functions. In the nonlinear regime we find families of solutions that bifurcate from the linear modes and study their stability for both self-focusing and self-defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. The total power of such nonlinear waves is finite without the need for apodization. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} interchangeable sockets is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and <b>types,</b> only separate <b>sockets</b> are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt <b>types</b> now have <b>sockets</b> of different <b>types</b> made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or <b>types</b> of <b>sockets</b> to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the [...] "set size" [...] is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in fractional inch and metric sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.|$|R
40|$|The {{quadrilateral}} (Quad) socket {{has been}} the socket of choice for the transfemoral since the 1950 s. It was developed {{as a result of}} extensive research work undertaken at the University of California, Berkely and San Francisco {{at the request of the}} veterans administration (VA) in USA following the 2 nd world war. However, these sockets were mainly designed for maimed but otherwise young and fit amputees, and there arose a doubt regarding whether they are also appropriate to be provided to the aged geriatric amputees which consists most of the today's amputee population. Since the 1970 s researchers started to point out the weaknesses of the Quad socket and advocated a newer <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> which has a bone-locking system by containing the amputee's ischial ramas inside to socket when being worn. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> is called Ischial-ramal containing (IC) socket and there have been many comments heard from researchers and amputees in favour of this newer <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> This project was designed to provide back up to the possible explanation for these voices to introduce this new <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> to be more widely available. We looked at the interface pressure distributed of Quad and IC socket for comparison as an index for the comfort level of the amputees wearing those two sockets.

5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} of LIF connectors {{are that the}} grip force between the contacts is lower, and the contacts can oxidize faster and decrease the lifespan of the connector. With the advent of frequent changes in PC processors, a need arose for these systems. Intel introduced the LIF socket system, in which the processor is inserted into the socket, rather than fixed by a lever. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> was used for some types of 386s and early 486s. This <b>type</b> of <b>socket</b> {{has been replaced by}} the ZIF socket, although LIF sockets are now used in modern 1.8" [...] hard disks.|$|R

40|$|A new <b>type</b> of above-knee <b>socket</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} to provide total surface support and to dispense with ischial bearing as the primary weight bearing area. The socket is based upon the hypothesis that if the soft tissues of an above-knee stump are adequately supported in a suitably shaped container they will behave under load as an elastic solid with low stiffness. A method has been devised for taking the cast for the new <b>type</b> <b>socket</b> using an elastic sleeve as a “compliant socket”. The grip of the elastic sleeve and the use of traction weights deform the stump tissues to the required shape while the cast is setting. The results of laboratory measurements of the transinterface pressures in these sockets under axial loading conditions have correlated well with the figures forecast by calculation. The new socket is now available to patients at a number of Centres in England...|$|R
