5|$|In {{the first}} five years of their marriage, Hańska gave birth to five children, four of whom died as infants. The {{surviving}} daughter, Anna, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> joy to Hańska, and she trusted her care to a young governess named Henriette Borel who had moved to Wierzchownia from the Swiss town of Neuchâtel.|$|E
5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, the Christian Science message <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} {{interval}} {{of three years}} between Germanicus' and Drusus' first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father. The hardship {{of the last two}} years on his father had made him reclusive. For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E

5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the raid against the Bruneval {{installation}} had two important effects. First, a successful raid against German-occupied territory <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> morale boost for the British public, and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill took a personal interest in the operation, and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to hear from Major Frost and several other officers {{who had participated in}} it. Several medals were awarded as a result.|$|E
5|$|In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas {{agreed to}} receive baptism and {{relinquish}} control over some lands in western Lithuania, {{in return for}} an acknowledgment by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, {{rather than to the}} Archbishop of Riga. This autonomy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> development. The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known. His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to integrate in the Second Republic; the party <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook {{reached his}} century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures {{half an hour}} after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before {{proceeding}} to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving {{in a manner that}} prompted Arlott to compare him to Frank Woolley.|$|E

25|$|To many secular rulers the Protestant reformation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> {{opportunity}} {{to expand their}} wealth and influence. The Catholic Church met {{the challenges of the}} reforming movements with what has been called the Catholic Reformation, or Counter-Reformation. Europe became split into northern Protestant and southern Catholic parts, resulting in the Religious Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{completed}} {{an adaptation of}} Alice Sebold's bestseller, The Lovely Bones, which was released in the United States on 11 December 2009. Jackson has said the film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> relief from his larger-scale epics. The storyline's combination of fantasy aspects and themes of murder bears some similarities to Heavenly Creatures. The film ended up receiving generally mixed reviews and middling box office returns. It currently holds 32% rotten on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E

25|$|A {{noteworthy}} minority {{within a}} minority on Argyle are the Bui Doi, those of mixed Vietnamese and American ancestry. Children of mixed unions had often suffered from discrimination in Vietnam, {{partly because of}} hostility to the US armed forces and partly because the women (the unions were almost always of Vietnamese women and American men) were seen as prostitutes. The most discriminated against were those of African American-Vietnamese parents. Uptown <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> relief for those who struggled with this oppression.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, he and {{his friend}} Stephan Hermlin, went to the Soviet {{occupation}} zone. In Leipzig he accepted a professorship for literary studies and became an influential critic of the new German literature. It was {{possible for him to}} cross between the East German and the West German world. In the East, he worked through his lectures and discussion circles, and in West Germany he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> guest at meetings of Group 47. He was also in contact with Bertolt Brecht during this time.|$|E
25|$|The Pigtail Ordinance was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to the overcrowding of jails due to the 1870 Sanitary Ordinance, which was originally meant to prevent unsafe tenement conditions in San Francisco. When in violation of the Sanitary Ordinance, one could either pay a fine or serve a week or more in jail; for thousands of impoverished Chinese immigrants, free room and board <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> punishment. Ostensibly to prevent outbreaks of lice and fleas, the Supervisors began requiring that all prisoners' heads be shaved. Many equal rights advocates, however, claimed the Supervisors' true intent was to stem the tide of willing Chinese convicts.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the Soviet space program, this {{tradition}} has spread into space, where appropriately small packages of bread and salt are used. It was observed at the Apollo-Soyuz and the Salyut project, when crackers and salt tablets were used in the spaceship. Bread chunks and salt <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> at the Mir space station, <b>a</b> tradition that <b>was</b> extended on the International space station. Bread and salt <b>are</b> also <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> for cosmonauts returning to Earth.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the treaty}} was in Bulgaria's favour, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> respite by the Byzantines, {{who had to}} regroup their forces after {{successive}} defeats, and who faced another round of internal turmoil because of the revival of iconoclasm. Bulgaria {{on the other hand}} also faced religious problems, as the growing number of Christians disturbed Omurtag: the Khan began anti-Christian persecutions, to which his eldest son Enravota also fell victim. The Bulgarians also had to restore their economy following the bloody conflicts of {{the first decade of the}} century, while their capital Pliska still lay in ruins.|$|E
25|$|After another totesport League round, the top {{division}} of the Championship continued with Kent thrashing Glamorgan, Warwickshire thrashing Gloucestershire and local rivals Surrey and Middlesex drawing. In the Second Division, Durham pulled away further at the top with another win, this time against Essex, with Worcestershire also scoring a win against Somerset. However, the main focus was on the warm-up games for the NatWest Series and the first ever Twenty20 International between England and Australia. The only surprise in the warm-ups <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> win for Bangladesh over Worcestershire, which provided a welcome confidence boost to the Bangladeshis before they took on England and Australia in the NatWest Series.|$|E
25|$|According to the Train's log, 30 September was {{a special}} day. It was the second {{day in a row}} that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would make up for the {{oversight}} on 1 October, but for the sailors it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> reprieve. While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where they at least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.|$|E
