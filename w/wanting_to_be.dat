The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

5|$|Eytel {{returned}} to Germany to study art for 18 months (1897–1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States. <b>Wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a cowboy, {{he worked as}} a cowhand in the San Joaquin Valley and in 1903 he would settle in Palm Springs.

He traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and missed the Battle of Shiloh as a result. In April, he decided to join Brig. Gen.

Afterward, Hines {{spent most of his time}} engaged in secret missions in his beloved Kentucky. Dressed in civilian clothes, he usually operated alone to avoid drawing attention to himself, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed as a spy.|$|E

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E

Despite not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E

5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E
5|$|In {{junior high}} school, they meet a tall, {{eccentric}} girl who befriends everyone named Chizuru Sarashina and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, {{who does not}} get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E
5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the storm finished, the Allied fleet {{returned}} to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae. The following day, (the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae. The same day, the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of Sciathos, and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium, at Aphetae. According to Herodotus, 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines, and were captured. Although clearly storm damaged, the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3:1. As a result, the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely. The Euboeans, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned to the Persians, bribed Themistocles to try {{to ensure that the}} Allied fleet remained. Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place, it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted, and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals, Eurybiades and Adeimantus to remain at Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
