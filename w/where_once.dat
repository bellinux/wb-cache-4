5|$|On {{the corner}} pendentives, {{each of which}} depicts a violent subject, {{the removal of the}} carbon black has diminished the {{dramatic}} intensity of all four scenes.

5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, <b>where</b> <b>once</b> on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E
5000|$|White Witch was a glam rock/psychedelic/hard {{rock band}} from Tampa, Florida that made two albums for Capricorn Records {{in the early}} 1970s.

As the band announced before their shows: [...] "To bring good <b>where</b> there <b>once</b> was evil, to bring love <b>where</b> there <b>once</b> was hate, to bring wisdom <b>where</b> there <b>once</b> was ignorance; this {{is the power of}} White Witch".|$|R

5|$|In their mobility, Khalid's {{troops had}} no match until the Mongol hordes of the 13th century. In fact {{the tactics of}} the desert Arabs and steppe Mongols were {{somewhat}} identical. Entire troops of Khalid would ride on camels while on march, whereas the Mongols used horses, with the difference that the Arabs did not make use of mounted archers. His most commonly used maneuver was surprise attack, such as his night attacks from three different sides on Persian camps at Zumail, Muzayyah and Saniyy, his highly mobile army successfully maneuvering in a 100km area, quickly destroying encampments of the Persians and their Arab allies. The Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj being no exception, <b>where</b> <b>once</b> again his highly mobile army maneuvered around a Byzantine army, appearing from four directions and opening several fronts at a time, a maneuver which later in 13th century {{became one of the}} Mongol armies' principal maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica <b>where,</b> <b>once</b> in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E
5|$|The former Town Hall, {{adjoining}} the old marketplace, {{houses the}} Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded {{and directed by}} Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is <b>where,</b> <b>once</b> upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister {{used to go to}} dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society two centuries ago.|$|E
