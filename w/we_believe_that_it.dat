We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E

30|$|First, it is {{important}} to note that our study focused on self-employment creation that originated from an unemployment position. Note that this group is rather homogeneous in terms of capital endowment, business motivation and growth intentions. For example, Hinz and Jungbauer-Gans (1999) and Oberschachtsiek (2012) reported that previously unemployed founders typically began businesses that needed less financial capital endowment and relied relatively more on a founder’s human capital structure. Associated with this overall difference, <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was acceptable to assume that the complexity of businesses founded to induce primary self-employment was lower than it was for those that were founded in general context of entrepreneurship (e.g., lower growth intentions). In addition, it seemed plausible to us that among the unemployed, the variation in business complexity would be rather low. As a result, missing information on business quality should—on average—have been less problematic in the population of the previously unemployed.|$|R
