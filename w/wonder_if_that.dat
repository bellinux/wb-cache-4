500|$|Piller was {{disappointed}} with the following Ro episode, [...] "", as it {{put her in the}} position of disbelieving Counselor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of [...] "victories" [...] in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions. But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in [...] "". Forbes shared the view of that episode, later saying [...] "When you have amnesia, you <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> brings out a side of you that's always wanted to come out. Would you really be comfortable with that? It's an interesting thing. I had a really good time with that episode." [...] Later in the season, [...] "The Next Phase" [...] was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi, but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters. Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel's original pitch for the episode [...] "". This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker. Instead, the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard.|$|E
500|$|In Takumi's {{initial draft}} of the story, the second episode, [...] "Turnabout Sisters", was the first episode of the game. The {{development}} team decided {{that it did not}} work well as something that would ease players into the game, because of its length among other factors. Because of this, Takumi wrote a shorter episode, [...] "The First Turnabout", which was used as the game's first episode. Takumi wanted players to focus on the thrill of [...] "nailing the culprit", especially for the first episode; because of this, the culprit of the first episode is shown in that episode's opening, as this was the most direct way Takumi could think of doing it. According to Takumi, it was a challenge to write the episode, as, in addition to keeping it short, he had to set up the world of Ace Attorney and the types of characters that players would meet. The third episode was written {{for the sake of the}} character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was [...] "rekindling the relationship". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth; he did <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as [...] an [...] "intensively passionate bond". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to in a way be the game's protagonist. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode was based on real events: when Takumi was in second grade, he had found a 5 yen coin and put it in his pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student, and made him apologize to her.|$|E
2500|$|September – Bruce C. Hafen of the First Quorum of the Seventy {{addressed}} {{members of}} Evergreen International at its 19th annual conference, {{which was held}} in the church's Joseph Smith Memorial Building and stated, [...] "If you are faithful, on resurrection morning—and maybe even before then—you will rise with normal attractions for the opposite sex. Some of you may <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> doctrine is too good to be true. But Elder Dallin H. Oaks has said it MUST be true" [...] (emphasis in original).|$|E

2500|$|The {{strike and}} ensuing fire sale left fans in Montreal livid. The Expos {{finished}} {{last in the}} NL East in , and average game attendance fell by nearly 26%, from 24,543 to 18,189. [...] Interest in the Expos continued to decline {{in the years that}} followed; they would never draw more than 20,000 fans per game again during their tenure in Montreal. While noting the Atlanta Braves went on to win 11 consecutive NL East titles following the strike, Jonah Keri expressed the viewpoint of the fans as it related to Brochu and the team's owners: [...] "Expos fans couldn't help but <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> could have been them celebrating every year ... had Brochu convinced the team's cheapskate owners to spend a few damn dollars, or taken a leap of faith that short-term financial pain would lead to long-term success." [...] The media, meanwhile, had taken to calling the Expos a [...] "Triple-A team" [...] as the team seemed to enter a period where they would develop players only to move them on to other organizations.|$|E

'And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, {{after she}} had taken {{a good look at}} the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!' ...|$|R
