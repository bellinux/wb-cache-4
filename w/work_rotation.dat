To them {{scheduling}} was everything and the competition for passengers meant {{you had to make}} the passage as fast as possible. This economic pressure combined with the staggering loss of life to the service during the Great Blizzard of 1888 spelled the end of the era of competition. By 1895 both states had combined to form the two Associations in existence today. Assets were liquefied and the first steam powered pilot vessel named New York went into service. The era of the Association brought better wages, a regular balanced <b>work</b> <b>rotation,</b> and more structured training. Many surnames of current pilots descend from this time. This era coincided with the deepening of the East Bank Channel into what is now called Ambrose Channel and the development of the petroleum industry in New Jersey that opened the Arthur Kill between Elizabeth and Perth Amboy and made the circumnavigation of Staten Island possible. Additionally this was the time of the great immigration.

5000|$|The {{medical problem}} {{associated}} with computer-related work is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS). CTS is a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints, especially the wrist, {{and can lead to}} numerous musculoskeletal problems. It has become very common among Computer professionals due to poorly placed computer components and extensive typing {{over a long period of}} time. Studies conducted show that one in eight computer professionals suffer from CTS. This study was conducted over 21 companies and the majority of sufferers said that they experienced acute and in some cases severe pain due to CTS. The main cause of CTS seems to be debatable, however, with many sources saying that the syndrome is predominantly caused by the acute positioning of the wrist while typing and this problem is exacerbated by the need for the user to be crouching towards the screen while typing. Different research conducted cites the mouse as being the main cause of CTS as it was found that among the fingers the right thumb was revealed to be more susceptible to CTS due to the acute position of the thumb while using the mouse. CTS, although prevalent, seems to be very difficult to ameliorate or cure due to the consistency in the design of computer components such as the mouse and the keyboard, but some companies are leading the way with technologies such as touch screen monitors which will reduce stress on the hand and wrist. Employers in major companies are also taking measures to ameliorate CTS by implementing frequent work breaks and <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> procedures to ensure that employees aren’t working on a single computer for hours on end [...] "a higher level of intensity of computer work results in higher risk for CTS."

This study determined how long it takes vascular function to recover after a single exposure to vibration in rats (125 Hz, acceleration 5 g). The responsiveness of rat-tail arteries to the vasoconstricting factor UK 14304, an 12 C-adrenoreceptor agonist, and the vasodilating factor acetylcholine (ACh) were measured ex vivo 1, 2, 7, or 9 d after exposure to a single bout of vibration. Vasoconstriction induced by UK 14304 returned to control levels after 1 d of recovery. However, re-dilation induced by ACh did not return to baseline until after 9 d of recovery. Exposure to vibration exerted prolonged effects on peripheral vascular function, and altered vascular responses to a subsequent exposure. To optimize the positive results of <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> schedules, it is suggested that studies assessing recovery of vascular function after exposure to a single bout of vibration be performed in humans.

The goal {{of this paper is to}} synthesize the research in early literacy instruction, the Daily 5 framework, and best practices in ELL instruction to provide specific recommendations for modifying the Daily 5 to better meet the needs of ELL students. The research focuses on early elementary instruction (K- 3) and ELLs at the beginning stage of English language acquisition.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{basis of}} this thesis {{is made up of}} interviews with men and women working at a supermarket, both with and without managerial responsibilities. The supermarket {{is an example of a}} working place where they use modern information technologies, and where there have been reorganisations pointing towards more flexibility, lesser hierarchies and higher autonomy for the workers. Such a working place is therefore a good example of an organisation on the new labour market. The aim of this thesis is to study how everyday work is affected by the new labour market’s working conditions and to relate these findings to established theories on society’s transformations. Four concepts are in focus; technology,flexibility, hierarchy and control. These are often emphasised as important in the debate on changed work organisations. According to the post industrial and information society perspective, knowledge and technology will play an important role on today’s labour market. The development of technology and knowledge at the supermarket points in many different directions at the same time. They use technology on a daily basis. The <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> has raised the qualification levels for some of the employees, but at the same time others feel that the more qualified parts of their work are moved away from them, into computer systems or to a national level. The development of <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> and partly self-governing work teams has given the employees more control over their everyday work but at the same time their resources are limited. They can decide when to do a task, but are often understaffed and have too many jobs to do. The work tasks are often heavy; the tempo is high, often with high noise. The work situation appears in many ways more industrial than service oriented. Workers are controlled through hierarchy but also by group norms, information technology, customers and by service-mindedness. The control mechanism has become more diverse, diffuse and harder to recognise. The changed work situation can be seen as two-fold. On the one hand there has been a humanisation of work, more autonomy, more opportunities to develop and many more interesting work tasks but on the other hand work density has risen while personnel resources have stayed the same in spite of increased opening hours and lager turnovers. The supermarket employees identify with their work tasks and take great responsibility for the work, even if their work conditions are hard. The work conditions that are now emphasised as flexible have long been the everyday reality for many employees, above all for many women in retail. Now these flexible work conditions have come to include both men and women in the working classes...|$|E

The physical workload on and the <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> between 52 workstations were assessed. As the outcome, real and potential quality deviations were studied during 10 weeks. Results show that workstations with higher physical workload had significantly more real deviations compared to lower workload stations.

Employees ’ tasks {{have been}} {{changing}} {{according to the}} current times by technical development and reform in complicated human relationships, and their capabilities and abilities are also continuing to improve. Therefore, the necessity for a competent rating to qualitatively understand relations between employees arises. In this paper, we select {{a model of a}} workplace where employees are sharing information from a variety of workplaces, and we suppose a personnel network which contains their relations in terms of mutual understanding. Some subgroups are sure to exist in this employee personnel network, and the personnel network can be improved by redesigning all the cliques of subgroup networks. However, with a huge number of employees it becomes extremely hard to find the maximum clique in the personnel network, meaning this problem is NP-hard.

40|$|The {{centerless}} grinding process demonstrates superior grinding accuracy with extremely high productivity, {{but only if}} the setup conditions are properly set up. Otherwise, various unfavorable phenomena manifest during the grinding processes and become serious obstacles to achieving that high quality and productivity. These phenomena are associated with the fundamental stabilities of the {{centerless grinding}} system, so it is essential to keep the system stable by setting up the appropriate grinding conditions. This paper describes the development of a model for finding the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy the three stability criteria of centerless grinding systems: (1) <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> stability for safe operations; (2) geometrical rounding stability for better roundness; and (3) dynamic system stability for chatter-free grinding. The objective of the model development is to produce combinations of optimal setup conditions as the outputs of the model, and to rank the priority of the outputs using PI (performance index) functions based on the process aims (productivity or accuracy). The paper demonstrates that the developed model, named Opt-Setup Master, can generate the optimum setup conditions to ensure safe operations, better roundness and chatter-free grinding. It provides practical setup conditions as well as scientific parameters and fundamental grinding parameters. Finally, the paper verifies that the Opt-Setup Master provides the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy all three stability criteria of the centerless grinding system...|$|E
40|$|Several common postdischarge symptoms, such as sleep disorders, headache, {{drowsiness}} {{or general}} malaise, evoke disturbances of circadian rhythms due to jet lag (ie crossing time zones) or shift <b>work</b> <b>rotation.</b> Considering that general anesthesia {{is associated with}} numerous effects on the central nervous system, we hypothesized that it may also act on the circadian timing system. We first determined {{the effects of the}} circadian timing on general anesthesia. We observed that identical doses of propofol showed marked circadian fluctuations in duration of effects, with a peak at the middle of the resting period (ie 7 h after lights on). Then, we examined the effects of general anesthesia on circadian timing, by analysing stable free-running circadian rhythms (ie in constant environmental conditions), an experimental approach used widely in circadian biology. Free-running rats were housed in constant darkness and temperature to assess possible phase-shifting effects of propofol anesthesia according to the time of the day. When administered around (+/- 2 h) the daily rest/activity transition point, a 30 -min propofol anesthesia induced a 1 -h phase advance in the free-running rest-activity rhythm, while anesthesia had no significant resetting effect at other times of the day. Anesthesia-induced hypothermia was not correlated with the phase-shifting effects of propofol anesthesia. From our results, anesthesia itself can reset circadian timing, and acts as a synchronizing cue for the circadian clock...|$|E

40|$|In {{the bamboo}} manuscripts {{unearthed}} from the Zhangjiashan 張家山 Han tomb, the term geng 更 denotes the work shift of state laborers. For instance, wu geng 五更(five geng) means engaging in official labor in five shifts, and geng liqie更隷妾 means a female penal laborer who <b>worked</b> by <b>rotation.</b> The antonym of geng is rong 冗, which means being {{engaged in a}} specific official task at frequent but irregular intervals, outside of the rotation system. Interestingly, the Zhangjiashan bamboo strips tell us that not only short-term state laborers drawn among the common population but also lower officials (scribes 史, diviners of scapulimancy 卜, oracles 祝, etc.), and elder officials attended to their <b>work</b> by <b>rotation.</b> According to the Shuihudi 睡虎地bamboo strips, {{the head of a}} low-level department in a county (xian 縣) office of the Qin empire was called sefu 嗇夫. Under the sefu, there were subordinates, the zuo佐and shi 史. In the Shuihudi materials, we find the phrase, zuo shi rong zhe佐史冗者(zuo and shi who worked outside of the rotation system). It follows that some public servants at the zuo/shi level were on duty by <b>rotation</b> and <b>worked</b> only several months per year. On the other hand, {{there is no indication that}} officials at levels higher than sefu <b>worked</b> by <b>rotation.</b> Most sefu were paid 100 bushels (bai dan 百石) annually or more. Officials at this level were called youzhi 有秩. One salary grade below youzhi was doushi 斗食, which appears as a specific standard of annual reward in the salary scale of the Latter Han dynasty in Hou Hanshu 後漢書. However, this was originally a category of daily food supply for state laborers, and meant to receive one dou 斗 of grain each day. It is, therefore, supposed that official servants at the doushi rank were rewarded according to the number of days on duty in earlier times, but came to receive a fixed annual salary by the second half of the Former Han at the latest. By contrast, youzhi officials had already received a fixed amount of annual salary, which the word zhi 秩 originally meant, during 538 the Qin. The above facts indicate that in the era of the Shuihudi and Zhangjiashan strips, some public servants at the zou/shi level attended to their <b>work</b> by <b>rotation,</b> and were paid according to the number of days on duty. In this respect, they were not substantially different from state laborers, or punitive laborers, even though the amount of daily pay each received, and other working conditions were not the same. Yet essential differences existed between youzhi and doushi. Officials at the rank of doushi or below had characteristics between those of guan 官(public servants) and min 民(commoners). Over time, doushi became a specific rank of annual salary, included into the category of youzhi. At the same time, evidence suggesting that zou/shi officials <b>worked</b> by <b>rotation</b> disappeared from historical sources. We can thus say that the bottom of bureaucratic hierarchy fluctuated over time, and the lowest class of official servants were formed through incorporating state laborers into the sphere of bureaucrats. In this sense, there was not a deep gap between guan and min, as both sides were linked with each other in a series of gradations...|$|R

40|$|In {{production}} systems, human operators {{may be at}} {{risk for}} developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), resulting in pain, inability to work and high costs. An increasingly capable tool for identifying MSD risks early in the production design process are Digital Human Models (DHMs), although their built-in analysis tools are in great need of development regarding how they address time-related aspects of load exposure. Some examples of time-related exposure phenomena provoking MSDs are repetitive work patterns, lack of variation, fatigue effects, <b>work</b> <b>rotation</b> effects, and distributions of activity/rest. The aim of this thesis is therefore two-fold; to explore pragmatic industrial needs regarding ergonomics evaluation and compare this to the State-of-the-art of scientific evaluation methods that address time-related aspects. The first approach, a case study in an automotive setting, revealed that switching from one evaluation method to another in a factory may be for pragmatic contextual reasons rather than based on educated selection. It was also shown that companies who do this may unintentionally risk producing evaluation results that are not equal regarding criteria levels or degree of analysis detail, rendering results unsatisfactory to use for some actors in the process. The second approach, a literature review, categorizes several time-related ergonomics terms and has proposed a ‘process-flow’ framework for the terms, based on an inputthroughput- output concept. This framework can give DHM tool developers an overview of which time-related aspects interact and which combinations are suited to different analysis goals. Lastly, the thesis reflects on actor roles and time perspectives...|$|E
