50|$|HSAN I is {{the most}} common type among the five types of HSAN. As a {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases, HSAN I can be divided into five subtypes HSAN IA-E. Most of <b>the</b> genes associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> have been identified. However, the molecular pathways leading to the manifestation of <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> are not fully understood. Therefore, the potential targets for therapeutic interventions are not known. Moreover, gene-based therapies for patients <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>diseases</b> are not available to date, hence supportive care is the only treatment available for the patients.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction also commonly occurs and those <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> are at greater risk of bowel cancer.|$|E
5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> {{have been reported}} as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E
5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> may have a new mutation. It seems that carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Pratchett {{announced}} that he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. He later made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer's Research Trust (now Alzheimer's Research UK), filmed a television programme chronicling his experiences <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> for the BBC, and also became a patron for Alzheimer's Research UK. Pratchett died on 12 March 2015 aged 66.|$|E

Woldearegay et al. (2015) reported that in Ethiopia, pastoralists apply prophylactic treatments (49.4 %) and deworming (89.8 %) to control bacterial infection and parasitic diseases of camels, respectively.|$|R
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E

5|$|Modelling {{the disease}} in various types of animals, such as the {{transgenic}} mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments. As these animals have faster metabolisms and much shorter lifespans than humans, results from experiments are received sooner, speeding research. The 1997 discovery that mHTT fragments misfold led {{to the discovery of}} the nuclear inclusions they cause. These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian, who {{was married}} to the former Kathleen Davis, also became {{involved}} with medical causes later in life. Along with Mike and Cindy Parseghian, his son and daughter-in-law, he founded the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation in 1994. The foundation is seeking a cure for Niemann-Pick disease Type C, a genetic disorder affecting children that causes the buildup of cholesterol in cells, resulting in damage to the nervous system and eventually death. Three of his grandchildren, Michael, Marcia, and Christa Parseghian, died from the disease.
