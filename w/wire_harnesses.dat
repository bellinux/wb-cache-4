2500|$|The band began each {{show in a}} {{separate}} curtained-off enclosure elsewhere {{on the floor of}} the venue. The dancers would carry torches onto the stage to the prerecorded track of [...] "The Imperial March". The band would then rise from the curtained enclosure to the Star Wars theme song and ride to the stage on [...] "hovering" [...] surfboards by means of <b>wire</b> <b>harnesses.</b> They would circle the stage and present themselves to each side of the audience before starting the first song, [...] "Larger than Life".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} three songs, each band member would {{separately}} introduce themselves to the audience as the others changed into their next costume. Initially this change involved removing the padded vests and wearing dark trench coats over the checkerboard turtlenecks from the space costumes. Later in the tour, the group donned black V-neck undershirts with the trenchcoats. They performed [...] "As Long As You Love Me" [...] with the song's signature [...] "chair routine". The backup dancers performed an extended chair routine and the band played an extended instrumental outro as the band changed into leather outfits for the next songs [...] "Don't Wanna Lose You Now" [...] and [...] "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)", during which the band was again hooked up to <b>wire</b> <b>harnesses</b> and flown over the crowd (each to a different side of the audience) during the song's outro. They would throw stuffed animals out to audience members from the air. During the extended instrumental outro to that song, the band would again change into red and black motocross racing deflectors (plastic upper body armor) on top of black shirts and pants. Metal ladders {{were added to the}} corners of the stage for the band to climb and hang on during the next song, [...] "Don't Want You Back".|$|E

50|$|The {{automotive}} <b>wiring</b> <b>harness</b> business commenced in 1949 with {{supplies to}} the Occupation Forces for their jeeps. In 1961, for the first time, the company supplied <b>wiring</b> <b>harnesses</b> for four-wheel-drive vehicles. At present, Sumitomo Electric promotes the automotive <b>wiring</b> <b>harness</b> business in a tripartite system, in which Sumitomo Electric takes charge of sales and business planning, Sumitomo Wiring Systems handles design and manufacturing, and AutoNetworks Technologies conduct research and development.

2500|$|Apart from digital, the {{physical}} effects performed in Smallville are key, especially {{when dealing with}} the villains that Clark must fight in each episode. In [...] "Nocturne", a teenage boy named Byron {{is transformed into a}} monster with superhuman strength. To demonstrate Byron's strength, the stunt team did a fifty-five foot [...] "chuck", where Bryon throws Clark across the front lawn. To accomplish the task they connected a wire to the stunt man's back, so when Bryon hits [...] "Clark" [...] they can use a crane and hydraulic system, positioned one hundred feet in the air, to pull the stunt man. Twenty-five feet into the pull the wire is released and the stunt man flies the rest of the distance to the landing pad. In [...] "Visage", the bone-morphing Tina Greer returns disguised as Whitney Fordman. When she learns that Lana wants Clark she decides to become Clark. The real Clark confronts Tina, which results in a physical fight between the two Clarks. The fight sequence between the two Clarks originally had more choreographed shots, but had to be cut down to five actions, as the fight sequence was pushing twenty minutes. For the scene, Welling performed all of his stunts alongside his usual stunt double, Christopher Sayour, who doubled as the [...] "second Clark" [...] in the sequence. For the actual stunt of leaping from the Daily Planet to the LuthorCorp building, the production team hooked Welling to a [...] "parallelogram" [...] on the studio greenscreen stage, and then filmed him running across a platform and leaping into the air. The parallelogram rig floated him in midair as he went over the building sill and began his downward trajectory. Although Welling did the initial stunt, his stunt double took over the chore of sliding through the glass as it explodes on contact. Welling is not the only actor to perform his own stunts. Kristin Kreuk performed her own stunts for the bridge scene in [...] "Dichotic", where she had to hang [...] above the river. Her willingness to perform her own stunts saved the team money on greenscreen effects, or stunt doubles that would have been used in her place. Though the cost of using a greenscreen was saved, Entity FX still had to digitally remove all the <b>wire</b> <b>harnesses</b> from the scene, which is an effect that goes unnoticed in the final product of the majority of episodes.|$|E
