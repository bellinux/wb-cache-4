5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish Flu killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, {{far more than}} {{had been killed in}} four years of war. A rigorous quarantine policy <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in Australia; although this reduced the immediate impact of the flu, the nation's death toll surpassed 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{territorial}} truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced {{a period of}} accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> {{during the reign of}} Casimir III.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy <b>was</b> <b>implemented.</b> The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
3000|$|... 2 <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on the {{operation}} sequence vector {{and the machine}} assignment vector successively. IPOX <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on {{the operation}} sequence vector and MPX <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> on the machine assignment vector.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sexual and}} asexual {{reproduction}}s <b>are</b> <b>implemented.</b> Asexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as producing the offspring's genome (the gene network) by directly copying the parent's genome. Sexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as the recombination {{of the two}} parents' genomes.|$|R
50|$|Because {{digital systems}} {{need not be}} causal, some {{operations}} can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in the digital domain that cannot <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using discrete analog components. Digital filters that require finite numbers of future values can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> while the analog counterparts cannot.|$|R
5|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird {{and it was}} widespread on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts {{have been made to}} prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 a new curricular {{adjustment}} was made, {{with the}} objective to fulfill all the quality accreditation requirements. In 2001 the coverage was increased by the aperture of the programs each semester {{and the creation of}} nocturnal courses. The same year, the research system <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> and the Publishing House was reopened.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 DragonFly BSD {{received}} a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds and removes device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers and removes {{the need for}} pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy. It <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
50|$|Most context models <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> as hash tables. Some small {{contexts}} <b>are</b> <b>implemented</b> {{as direct}} lookup tables.|$|R
50|$|Both {{energy and}} carbon taxes have <b>been</b> <b>implemented</b> in {{responses}} to commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In most cases where an energy or carbon tax <b>is</b> <b>implemented,</b> the tax <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> {{in combination with}} various forms of exemptions.|$|R
40|$|This {{report by}} the Legislative Audit Council reviews the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. In our {{follow-up}} review, it found that 4 of 17 recommendations to DHEC had <b>been</b> <b>implemented,</b> 5 had <b>been</b> partially <b>implemented,</b> and 8 had not <b>been</b> <b>implemented.</b> Of the six recommendations to the General Assembly, none had <b>been</b> <b>implemented...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2012, WMATA {{announced}} enhanced {{rush period}} service that <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> on June 18, 2012, {{under the name}} “Rush+” (or “Rush Plus”). Rush Plus service occurred only during portions of peak service: 6:30–9:00 AM and 3:30–6:00 PM, Monday through Friday.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on solid phase. The solid phase synthesis <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> using, as containers for the solid phase, miniature glass columns similar in their shape to low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with porous filters.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, 1993, Clinton {{signed into}} law the Brady Bill, which {{mandated}} federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.|$|E

30|$|The {{functions}} (link, format, button, {{and page}} title) that can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through markup language {{should not only}} <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> through Java script because if they only depend on it, the link, format, button, and page title may not <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> {{in an environment where}} such implementation is impossible.|$|R
5|$|Part of the National Policy <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in {{the budget}} {{presented}} in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs {{for the remainder of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Seton Hall offers {{multiple}} dining options {{ranging from}} a traditional cafeteria to a food court. Some options include Build Your Own Burgers (BYOB) and Dunkin Donuts. In 2013, University officials decided that meat would not be served in the cafeteria on Ash Wednesday and Fridays during the liturgical season of Lent in practice of the abstinence of meat during the Lenten season. In 2014, the policy <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> to all on-campus eateries.|$|E
5|$|That {{exposed the}} fact that {{domestic}} firms could not compete with foreign imports because of the overvalued currency and long-term structural problems. A financial reform <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> that aimed both to liberalize capital markets and to link Argentina more effectively with the world capital market.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 Ford Focus Electric {{was planned}} to include warning sounds for pedestrians. Ford Motor Company {{developed}} four alternative sounds, and in June 2011 involved the electric car fans by {{asking them to}} pick their favorite from the four potential warning sounds through the Focus Electric Facebook page. However, ultimately Ford decided to hold off including warning sounds unless federal legislation required it, and no such system <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> on the production vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The E and J trains were rerouted to Jamaica Center. Buses {{were also}} rerouted from the 169th Street station {{to the new}} Jamaica Center station to serve the rerouted subway services. A new skip-stop service, called the Z train, <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> along the J route, similar to skip-stop service along the route prior to 1976.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{language}} was banned in East Timor and Indonesian was made {{the language of}} government, education and public commerce, and the Indonesian school curriculum <b>was</b> <b>implemented.</b> The official Indonesian national ideology, Pancasila, was applied to East Timor and government jobs were restricted to those holding certification in Pancasila training.|$|E

5|$|The academy's {{teaching}} style forms {{part of the}} Thayer system, which <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> by Sylvanus Thayer during his tour as Superintendent. This form of instruction emphasizes small classes with daily homework, and strives to make students actively {{responsible for their own}} learning by completing homework assignments prior to class and bringing the work to class to discuss collaboratively.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} company CMC Limited {{had developed a}} Games and Event Management System (GEMS), which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with Doordarshan, the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information. Additionally, cutting-edge technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) <b>was</b> <b>implemented,</b> so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work.|$|E
5|$|With the {{enhanced}} {{features of the}} 32X, the developers were given more freedom in designing Knuckles' Chaotix compared to previous games. To {{take advantage of the}} more powerful hardware, several levels feature dynamic sprite-scaling effects, and the game's special stages were rendered with 3D polygons. A complex palette system <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> as well, allowing each level to load its own unique palette.|$|E
