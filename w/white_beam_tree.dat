In particular, we propose a novel method {{that allows us to}} significantly speed-up the construction of the <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> in <b>beam</b> tracing applications, by avoiding space subdivision. This allows us to dynamically recompute the <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> as the sound source moves. In order to speedup the construction of the <b>beam</b> <b>tree,</b> we determine what portion of which reflectors the beam “illuminates ” by performing visibility checks in the “dual ” of the geometric space. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{high-quality}} audio-realistic rendering in com-plex environments, we need to determine all the acoustic paths that go from sources to receivers, due to specular reflections as well as diffraction phenomena. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel method for computing and auralizing the reflected as well as the diffracted field in 2. 5 D environments. The method is based on a preliminary geometric analysis of the mutual visibility of the environment re-flectors. This allows us to compute on the fly all possible acoustic paths, as the information on sources and receivers becomes avail-able. The construction of a <b>beam</b> <b>tree,</b> in fact, is here performed through a look-up of visibility information and the determination of acoustic paths is based on a lookup on the computed <b>beam</b> <b>tree.</b> We also show how to model diffraction using the same <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> structure used for modeling reflection and transmission. In order to validate the method we conducted an acquisition campaign over a real environment and compared the results ob-tained with our real-time simulation system. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{accelerating}} the computation of specular reflections in complex 3 D enclosures, based on acoustic beam tracing. Our method constructs the <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> on the fly through an iterative lookup process of a precomputed data structure that collects {{the information on the}} exact mutual visibility among all reflectors in the environment (region-to-region visibility). This information is encoded in the form of visibility regions that are conveniently represented in the space of acoustic rays using the Plücker coordinates. During the beam tracing phase, the visibility of the environment from the source position (the <b>beam</b> <b>tree)</b> is evaluated by traversing the precomputed visibility data structure and testing the presence of beams inside the visibility regions. The Plücker parameterization simplifies this procedure and reduces its computational burden, as {{it turns out to be}} an iterative intersection of linear subspaces. Similarly, during the path determination phase, acoustic paths are found by testing their presence within the nodes of the <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> data structure. The simulations show that, with an average computation time per beam in the order of a dozen of microseconds, the proposed method can compute a large number of beams at rates suitable for interactive applications with moving sources and receivers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) use the full bandwidth of an undulator harmonic {{in order to}} maximize the coherent flux for small angle X-ray scattering experiments. X-ray mirrors and filters are typically used to select a given harmonic of the spectrum. At the University of Michigan/Howard University/Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs, Collaborative Access Team (MHATT-CAT) undulator beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, we have designed a fixed-angle Double Mirror Filter which will provide a “pink beam” (i. e., 2 – 3 % bandwidth) for XPCS experiments. This device uses two small mirrors which vertically reflect a 0. 1  mm× 0. 1  mm 0. 1 mm× 0. 1 mm <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> in a symmetric geometry. The doubly reflected beam propagates parallel to the incident <b>white</b> <b>beam,</b> but is offset vertically by 35 mm. Using the standard offset of the APS allows one to stop the <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> with a standard APS beam stop. In this report, we will describe our design considerations for this instrument. We also report the results of preliminary tests of the performance. The mirrors preserve the transverse coherence of the source, and filter the undulator spectrum as expected. © 2000 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel method for {{computing}} and auralizing the diffracted field using visibility diagrams. The method allows us to concentrate in a pre-processing phase all the heavy computational tasks that can be per-formed without knowing the locations of source or receiver. In particular, we can pre-compute the visibility diagrams of all reflectors and all the <b>beam</b> <b>trees</b> (and the correspond-ing diffracting filters) that are associated to the diffracting wedges on reflectors. Using this information and the source’s location, we can generate the corresponding <b>beam</b> <b>tree</b> of ge-ometric reflections. Once the receiver’s location is given, we can also generate all geometric paths and the coefficients of the actual diffracting filter. This allows us to model in real-time reflections, diffractions, transmissions in a complex en-vironment with sources and receivers that can freely move. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{distribution}} of crystallographic defects and deformation in silicon crystals subjected to deep implantation (20 - 50 µm) with ions {{of the energy}} of a few MeV/amu is studied. Three different buried layered structures (single layer, binary buried structure and triple buried structure) were obtained by implantation of silicon single crystals with 184 MeV argon ions, 29. 7 MeV boron ions, and 140 MeV argon ions, each implantation at a fluency of 1 × 1014 ions cm- 2. The implanted samples were examined by means of <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> X-ray section and projection topography, mono-chromatic beam topography and by recording local rocking curves with the beam restricted to 50 × 50 µm 2. The experi-ment pointed to a very low level of implantation-induced strain (below 10 - 5). The <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> Bragg case section ex-periment revealed a layer producing district black contrast located {{at a depth of}} the expected mean ion range. The pres-ence of these buried layered structures in studied silicon crystals strongly affected the fringe pattern caused by curva-ture of the samples. In case of <b>white</b> <b>beam</b> projection and monochromatic beam topographs the implanted areas were revealed as darker regions with a very tiny grain like structure. One may interpret these results as the effect of consid-erable heating causing annihilation of point defects and formation of dislocation loops connected with point defect clusters.

First section covers the Rendering Engine software with capabilities of rendering complex hybrid scenes for immersive environments. The client-server architecture of the engine is described and then a number of standard plug-ins extending the functions of the system are presented. Section 2 describes an interactive system for navigation through highresolution cylindrical panoramas. Topics such as acquisition of panoramas, camera calibration and occluding objects removal, are covered in detail.
