The conductance follows typical power law behavior {{as a function of}} temperature or electric field, whichever is the greater, arising from their strong one-dimensional character. Numerous theoretical ideas have been used in an attempt to understand the conductivity of one-dimensional systems, where strong interactions between electrons lead to departures from normal metallic (Fermi liquid) behavior. Important concepts are those introduced by Tomonaga, Luttinger and <b>Wigner.</b> <b>Effects</b> caused by classical Coulomb repulsion (called Coulomb blockade), interactions with vibrational degrees of freedom (called phonons) and Quantum Decoherence [...] have also been found to be important in determining the properties of molecular wires.|$|R
40|$|We derive simple {{relations}} between the polarized and unpolarized valence quark distributions in a light-cone SU(6) quark-spectator model for nucleons. The explicit x-dependent <b>Wigner</b> rotation <b>effect</b> for the light-flavor quarks is calculated. It is shown that the mass difference between the scalar and vector spectators could reproduce {{the up and down}} valence quark asymmetry that accounts for the observed ratio $F_ 2 ^{n}/F_ 2 ^{p}$. The proton, neutron, and deuteron polarization asymmetries, $A_ 1 ^p$, $A_ 1 ^n$, and $A_ 1 ^d$, are in agreement with the available data by taking into account the <b>Wigner</b> rotation <b>effect.</b> The calculated $x$-dependent helicity distributions of the up and down valence quarks are compared with the recent results from semi-inclusive hadron asymmetries in polarized deep inelastic scattering by the Spin Muon Collaboration.

The proton spin could be fully provided by the spin sum of quarks if one considers the <b>Wigner</b> rotation <b>effect</b> in the measured quark helicity distributions. Parton sum rules provide information of the quark distributions in the nucleons and are very useful to reveal new physics if a sum rule is found to be satisfied or broken. Parton sum rules or similar relations played important roles in the establishment of the quark-parton model. Recently there have been new interests in the Ellis-Jaffe sum rules (EJSR) and Gottfried sum rule (GSR). They are found to be broken by the EMC and NMC experiments. This inspired a vast number of studies on the explicit spin and flavor distributions in the nucleons. 1.

500|$|The {{successful}} {{testing of}} the new cores in the Sandstone tests had a profound effect. Practically every component of the old weapons was rendered obsolete. Even before the third test had been carried out, Bradbury had halted production of the old cores, and ordered that all effort was to be concentrated on the Mark 4 nuclear bomb, which would become the first mass-produced nuclear weapon. The more efficient use of fissionable material would increase the nuclear stockpile from 56 bombs in June 1948 to 169 in June 1949. The Mark III bombs were withdrawn from service in 1950. At the same time, new production plants were coming online and the <b>Wigner</b> <b>effect</b> problem had been solved. By May 1951, plutonium production was twelve times that of 1947, while uranium-235 production had increased eight-fold. The Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, Major General Kenneth D.

A key open issue is whether the point defects that can occur in these low-dimensional devices are the physical cause behind this conductance anomaly. Here we adopt a scanning gate microscopy technique to map individual impurity positions in several quasi- 1 D constrictions and correlate these with conductance characteristics. Our data demonstrate that the 0. 7 anomaly can be observed irrespective of the presence of localized defects, and we conclude that the 0. 7 anomaly is a fundamental property of low-dimensional systems...|$|R

40|$|Interelectron {{interactions}} and correlations in quantum dots {{can lead to}} spontaneous symmetry breaking of the self-consistent mean field resulting in formation of Wigner molecules. With the use of spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree-Fock (sS-UHF) calculations, such symmetry breaking is discussed for field-free conditions, as well as {{under the influence of}} an external magnetic field. Using as paradigms impurity-doped (as well as the limiting case of clean) two-electron quantum dots (which are analogs to helium-like atoms), it is shown that the interplay between the interelectron repulsion and the electronic zero-point kinetic energy leads, for a broad range of impurity parameters, to formation of a singlet ground-state electron molecule, reminiscent of the molecular picture of doubly-excited helium. Comparative analysis of the conditional probability distributions for the sS-UHF and the exact solutions for the ground state of two interacting electrons in a clean parabolic quantum dot reveals that both of them describe formation of an electron molecule with similar characteristics. The self-consistent field associated with the triplet excited state of the two-electron quantum dot (clean as well as impurity-doped) exhibits symmetry breaking of the Jahn-Teller type, similar to that underlying formation of nonspherical open-shell nuclei and metal clusters. Furthermore, impurity and/or magnetic-field effects can be used to achieve controlled manipulation of the formation and pinning of the discrete orientations of the <b>Wigner</b> molecules.
