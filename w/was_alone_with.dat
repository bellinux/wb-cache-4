She believes John still lusts after Abigail and tells him that as long as he does, he will never redeem himself.|$|E

While Ramesses was talking with the princes, the Hittite chariots crossed the river and charged the middle of the Re division as they were making their way toward Ramesses' position.

25|$|For the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode {{in support}} of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, {{trailing}} race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he slid down the board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Spanish rider Juan Manuel GÃ¡rate, but as Voigt did not think he had done enough to deserve the victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win {{of the season in}} the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, {{and as he}} {{did with}} his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E

Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, recalls that Louise had withheld the seriousness of her condition from him for eight weeks before September 1969, [...] "in case George was busy" [...] with his career, and that, following her death, Harrison was anxious about how his father would manage alone. Keen to strengthen the familial bond, Harrison invited his brothers Harold and Pete to live on his Friar Park estate in Oxfordshire, along with their father.|$|E

She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E

When Beria complimented Alexander Poskrebyshev's daughter on her beauty, Poskrebyshev quickly pulled her aside and instructed her, [...] "Don't ever accept a lift from Beria."

During the 10 minutes {{that he was in}} the enclosure, Villalobos <b>was</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> an 11-year-old male Amur tiger named Bashuta, a three-year resident of the zoo at the time, before being mauled. Villalobos was attacked on his shoulder, arms, legs, and back, before he was rescued by zoo officials who used fire extinguishers to chase the tiger away and told Villalobos to escape by rolling under a wire. Villalobos was taken to an area hospital and reported in stable condition. He had petted the 400-pound animal and wanted to be [...] "one with the tiger". The tiger was not euthanized as a result of the incident, since it was clearly provoked, and the mauling did not result in a fatality.|$|E
