Here <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> add the rule {{that all of the}} {{original}} face planes must be present in the stellation, i.e. we do not consider partial stellations. For example the cube is not usually considered a stellation of the cuboctahedron.|$|E
25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, {{a crystal lattice}} lies in its ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The random motion of the atoms in the lattice is what <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> think of as heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E

25|$|Historically {{first and}} conceptually {{simplest}} is degree centrality, which {{is defined as}} the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number of ties directed to the node and outdegree is the number of ties that the node directs to others. When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. <b>We</b> <b>usually</b> {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Price Peterson, of TV.com, {{gave the}} episode a positive review, writing that he [...] "oved this episode. That reveal was simultaneously shocking and heartbreaking. Plus it {{took one of}} the show's most annoying characters (Trina) and made her both sympathetic and heartbreaking." [...] He also praised the information found on Veronica's mother: [...] "It was nice that Veronica got to see a better side of her mother than <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> do…Heartwarming!" [...] Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune, called the episode [...] "engrossing" [...] and that it is a better use of a viewer's time than Lost, which aired {{at the same time as}} Veronica Mars.|$|E

500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, {{it sounds like a}} rock power ballad.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} {{marijuana is}} prominently featured in the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of {{a scene in which}} Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since {{they did not want to}} instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. [...] "Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This is really going to kill everything...'", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Girl in the Big Ten" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} Jon Vitti and directed by Lauren MacMullan. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> do these things that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, then we have to change it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot as a [...] "first-person {{narrative}} about the horrors {{leading up to}} the final moments of a soldier at war", and was described as [...] "a single, long and tight close-up of the soldier's eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music. Reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory, gunfire, helicopters and tanks, explosions, poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home, and the images of his death." [...] Two endings were shot; one in which the soldier is killed as the result of sustained combat wounds, and another in which the soldier commits suicide by hanging - the latter one was used. Jeff Hanneman confirmed that the band [...] "loved" [...] the eye concept, and [...] personally felt that the video was [...] "pretty amazing" [...] when he first viewed it. King admitted that the film is [...] "pretty cool — I thought it was neat idea — very different, especially for us, because <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> do performance based videos." [...] The video was exclusively posted on mp3.com late in October 2006. In April 2007, it was announced that the video had earned a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards nomination for Best Video with the winner to be revealed on June 11, 2007, at the Koko Club in London, England.|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So much of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd like you to keep closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul R. Brown was filmed in Burbank, California between March 9 and March 10, 2007. The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. <b>We</b> <b>usually</b> do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really {{hit the nail on the}} head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E

On October 15, 2009, Kris Allen covered the {{song for the}} first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His {{rendition}} received positive reviews. The song is heard, prominently but briefly, during the climactic fight-scene in the 2005 animated film Robots. Fender, while wearing a skirt, was busy fighting to the beat of the song. An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album Kids Superhits. The same year, British death metal cover band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their Return of the Ten Masked Men album. A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film Ready to Rumble. In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the remake film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was [...] "really, really, dark and really rock, [...] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that <b>we</b> <b>usually</b> do." [...] In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is [...] "as redolent and fetching as any of 's peaks". Japanese pop singer Shiori Takei covered the song of her 2005 album The Note of My Nineteen Years.|$|E
