5|$|A further church, {{located in}} South Dunedin {{close to the}} southeastern edge of Caversham, is the South Dunedin Wesley Methodist Church in Hillside Road. This building, {{constructed}} in 1893, <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with demolition in 2009.|$|E
5|$|By 2005 the {{building}} was in a bad state of repair, and <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with demolition. Although heritage groups won a stay of execution, the cinema was demolished in spring 2008. A replacement building is planned for the site.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lost}} of Tien Phuoc and Phouc Lam, the ARVN 916th Regional Force Battalion retreated from the area. Thus, Tam Kỳ, {{the capital of}} Quảng Tin Province, <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> to be overrun by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat degradation. It {{requires}} open {{habitat for}} germination, but {{this kind of}} habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by introduced flora. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by introduced grazing animals.|$|R
50|$|Scenes where Donald <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with a {{knife and}} the police officer <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with an axe have been cut.|$|R
50|$|This plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{firewood}} harvesting, {{which has}} caused habitat destruction in the area. It may also <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by mining operations.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, a {{pre-season}} {{match between}} Essendon and Fitzroy <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with strike {{action by the}} association over the VFL’s non-recognition of the body. The VFL halted the proposed strike by agreeing to recognise the association as the negotiating body for all players.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{a fire in}} 1874 {{that swept}} through the long grass and other {{vegetation}} of the south districts of the colony and reached Charles V's wall before burning out.|$|E
5|$|Marquinhos' {{transfer}} <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by anomalies in {{his medical}} exam, and {{he missed the}} team's pre-season visit to Sweden. His mother {{said that he had}} caught a virus, with PSG denying claims circulated by Le Parisien that he had hepatitis.|$|E
50|$|These {{habitats}} <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> in {{the wild}} and in addition, E. revolutum may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by collection for horticulture and soil compaction by forestry machinery.|$|R
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat. In New Mexico it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by oil and gas development and {{the changes that have}} occurred on the land due to overgrazing, such as erosion and introduced species of plants. In Texas, the plant grows on roadsides and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by roadway maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Populations of epauletted fruit bats <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{pesticides}} on fruit, human disturbance and over-collecting in the past. However {{the number}} one reason it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>is</b> habitat destruction.|$|R
5|$|Sometime before 1290 Burnell {{vowed to}} go on crusade to help {{reinforce}} the crusader city of Acre, which <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by Muslims in the late 1280s, but he never fulfilled his obligation.|$|E
5|$|The theater {{struggled}} financially after re-opening, requiring {{financial aid}} from the District government. In 2011, the theatre <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with closure after the city cut funding. The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities then took over management, and began searching for a new operator.|$|E
5|$|According to {{management}} researcher John J. Clancey, scientific management can involve {{the use of}} throffers. While piecework had been utilised since the Middle Ages, Frederick Winslow Taylor blended rationalised management with piecework, {{to create a new}} system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they were able to exceed the standard, while lower pay <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> for any who did not meet expectations.|$|E
50|$|According to the World Wildlife Fund {{the status}} of the {{ecoregion}} is Critical/Endangered.Smallholders along the rivers undertake mixed agriculture, forest exploitation, small-scale logging and livestock raising.In some areas the várzea forest <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by large-scale logging and cattle farming.Fish populations <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by large-scale fishing operations and may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by excessive collection of aquarium fish such as the red discus (Symphysodon discus).Gold mining contaminates the Purus and Japurá with mercury.|$|R
50|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss, but {{the total}} {{population}} is stable and the species <b>is</b> not <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{habitat loss}} due to {{deforestation}} for timber and agriculture and its current status <b>is</b> near <b>threatened.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the war, the {{popularity}} of cinemas waned as more people acquired televisions, and by 1965 there were only 40 cinemas left in Manchester. Cine City <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with closure in 1997 when Geoff Henshaw, the owner at the time, died. It was purchased by David Babsky, who kept the cinema open until July 2001, when it closed due to competition from a new multiplex cinema in nearby East Didsbury.|$|E
5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed {{for a little while}} as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> seized us.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
50|$|In Latvia, the Union of Greens and Farmers is {{supportive}} of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by development, while small farms <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by large industrial-scale farms.|$|R
50|$|Northern bobwhite and California quail {{are popular}} gamebirds, with many taken by hunters, but these species {{have also had}} their ranges {{increased}} to meet hunting demand and <b>are</b> not <b>threatened.</b> They <b>are</b> also artificially stocked. Some species <b>are</b> <b>threatened</b> by human activity, such as the bearded tree quail of Mexico, which <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss and illegal hunting.|$|R
50|$|This species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by livestock, which {{relish the}} semi-succulent leaves. It <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by {{recreational}} {{activity in the}} habitat.|$|R
5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} they saw as their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1568 Sigismund Augustus, who {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a war fleet enlargement program, established the Maritime Commission. A conflict with the City of Gdańsk (Danzig), which felt that its monopolistic trade position <b>was</b> <b>threatened,</b> ensued. In 1569 Royal Prussia had its legal autonomy largely taken away, and in 1570 Poland's supremacy over Danzig and the Polish King's authority over the Baltic shipping trade were regulated and received statutory recognition (Karnkowski's Statutes).|$|E
5|$|In 1951 he was {{elevated}} to archimandrite while serving in Alexandria. While there he <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with arrest for preventing {{the execution of}} a sentence passed by a Sharia tribunal. On August 27, 1954, he was named auxiliary bishop of Antioch; then, on September 2, 1954, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Nubia. Zoghby was formally consecrated bishop on November 21, 1954, when he was {{elevated to}} Patriarchal Vicar for the See of Alexandria, Cairo and the Sudan.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this species}} <b>is</b> not <b>threatened</b> with extinction, its habitat may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the spread of}} the garlic mustard (Alliaria officinalis).|$|R
50|$|Schizolaena parviflora <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{deforestation}} due to shifting {{patterns of}} agriculture. The species <b>is</b> also <b>threatened</b> by timber harvesting and wildfires.|$|R
50|$|The plant <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the loss}} and {{degradation}} of its habitat, mainly due {{to the presence of}} feral pigs and non-native plants. Some of the plant's habitat is on military territory and it may <b>be</b> <b>threatened</b> by military activity.|$|R
5|$|In 1977 {{the site}} <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with {{destruction}} {{as part of}} wider plans to dredge the Klondike City site for gold. The land was instead purchased by the Government of Canada, and the site is now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation. An archaeological investigation of the site took place in 1998, documenting {{the structure of the}} building and analysing the industrial remains.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, campaigners mounted {{legal action}} to {{preserve}} {{an area of}} grassland created on {{the route of the}} old A33 Winchester bypass in mitigation of the land lost to the motorway which <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> by a Park and Ride site. The legal action failed and the campaigners claimed that they had been betrayed for a second time. Land was provided elsewhere in mitigation.|$|E
5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of {{toothache}} and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She <b>was</b> <b>threatened</b> with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.|$|E
