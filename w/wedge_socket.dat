5000|$|The Lucas Oil Stadium {{retractable}} {{roof system}} is operated by 32 cables, each 1½" [...] in diameter, with galvanized {{right and left}} hand lay. They were manufactured specifically for this project by Wire Rope Corporation of America and furnished by The Tway Company Inc. located in Indianapolis. The lengths vary from 232’6" [...] to 245’ and include a Johnson <b>Wedge</b> <b>Socket</b> installed on one end that terminates the cables at the roof peak 288’ above the stadium floor.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wedge</b> <b>socket</b> {{termination}} {{is useful}} when the fitting {{needs to be}} replaced frequently. For example, if {{the end of a}} wire rope is in a high-wear region, the rope may be periodically trimmed, requiring the termination hardware to be removed and reapplied. An example of this is on the ends of the drag ropes on a dragline. The end loop of the wire rope enters a tapered opening in the socket, wrapped around a separate component called the wedge. The arrangement is knocked in place, and load gradually eased onto the rope. As the load increases on the wire rope, the wedge become more secure, gripping the rope tighter.|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} {{methods for}} removing dragline bucket wire rope terminations {{with the objective}} of finding efficient methods that are safer than the method most commonly used at U. S. surface mines, which is to use the explosive impact of a projectile fired from a cannon to remove the rope termination. Removal of a wire rope termination for repair or replacement requires separation of the <b>wedge</b> and <b>socket</b> that lock together to secure the rope end. The Bureau investigated currently used methods and improved upon and tested two safer alternate methods for removing wire rope terminations. A cannon test program was conducted, using 40 -and 50 -gr primer (detonating) cord, to establish the possible force produced with a 4 -in-bore cannon and a 55 -lb projectile. <b>Wedge</b> and <b>socket</b> units supplied from cooperating mines were separated under controlled conditions to establish data on separation force requirements. The two alternate methods investigated were use of the force generated by (1) a pendulum ram and by (2) a portable hydraulic pusher. Both methods are capable of providing sufficient force to effect <b>wedge</b> and <b>socket</b> separations on draglines with up to 78 -yd 3 buckets under normal conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Some lamps have pins placed closer together, {{preventing}} them from being interchanged with bulbs that are too high power, which may cause excessive heat and possibly fire. These are sometimes called [...] "mini-bipin". Some of these, particularly in automotive lighting, have the pins bent back onto {{the sides of the}} base of the bulb, this is instead called a <b>wedge</b> base or <b>socket.</b>|$|R
