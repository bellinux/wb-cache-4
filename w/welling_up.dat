The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains, Bull Mountains, Castle Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Highwood Mountains, Judith Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, Snowy Mountains, Sweet Grass Hills, and—in the state's southeastern corner near Ekalaka—the Long Pines. Many of these isolated eastern ranges were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when magma <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> from the interior cracked and bowed the earth's surface here.|$|E
500|$|Another {{hypothesis}} for {{the colored}} regions {{is that they}} are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring [...] important astrobiological implications, as they {{may play a role in}} prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis.|$|E
500|$|That {{spreading}} ridges {{could be}} subducted was recognized {{early in the}} development of plate tectonic theory, but there was little consideration of the ensuing effects. In the 1980s came realization that the magma <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> from the asthenosphere through the subducted ridge would not reach seawater, and thus not be quenched to form rock and close the gap. Continued spreading would lead to a widening gap or [...] "window" [...] in the subducting plate through which there could be increased flow of magma The implications of this for Siletzia were first shown by [...] and [...] (following the pioneering work by [...] ). [...] subsequently identified the fan-shaped wake of volcanics of distinctive geochemistry left by the widening Kula-Farallon slab window across northeastern Washington and into Idaho.|$|E

500|$|The single reel film, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 31, 1911. The Billboard praised Marie Eline's acting also noting the good photography in its review. The Moving Picture Worlds review states, [...] "The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart. The person who can sit through this and not feel the tears <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, {{when she left the}} son's house and when she left the home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company's superior films. It would take time in life, and a split in the film would have done it. Such things spoil the illusion to a spectator." ...|$|E
500|$|Sea {{temperature}} chiefly {{depends on}} the amount of solar radiation it absorbs. In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about [...] These temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. The cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> again to the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between [...] {{in all parts of the}} globe. In freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, flat sheet called nilas, which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. In turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as [...] "pancakes". These slide over and under one another to form floes. During these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. Nilas forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline.|$|E
2500|$|The Pryor Mountains are a [...] {{region of}} Montana and Wyoming. They were {{formed in the}} late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary period (about 70 to 60 million years ago) when magma <b>welling</b> <b>up</b> from below cracked a vast {{limestone}} plateau into four pieces and uplifted {{the northeast corner of}} each piece. The Bighorn River flows north from Wyoming until it reaches the plateau between the Bighorn and Pryor mountains. The river flows along the fault line between the two mountain ranges, and has cut the Bighorn Canyon deep into the limestone. The Crow Native American tribe called the mountains Baahpuuo Isawaxaawuua ("Hitting the Rock Mountains"), because of the large amount of flint found there (a type of rock which could be chipped into arrowheads and spear points). The mountains draw their current name from Sergeant Nathaniel Hale Pryor, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who vainly pursued horses stolen from the expedition in the area.|$|E
