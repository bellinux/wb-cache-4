After the first shock of finding herself discovered she had stood pale but uncowed before her bureau, with her eyes rather on him than on me. Her hands, I think, were behind her upon the edge of the <b>writing</b> <b>flap,</b> and she was a little leaning upon them. She had the watchful alert expression of one who faces an unanticipated but by no means overwhelming situation. She cast a remark to me. [...] "But I do not want to come with you," [...] she said. [...] "I have told you I do not want to come with you." [...] All her mind seemed concentrated upon what she should do with Justin. [...] "You must send him away," [...] he was saying. [...] "It's an abominable thing. It must stop. How can you dream it should go on?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon meeting Bourne in 2005, Al Silverman {{described}} her, [...] "Nina {{came out}} of the elevator with a little smile on her face. It had to be her. Looking closer, I saw that her face was absolutely untouched by age. She had a small hat over small bangs, giving her that Anita Loos look. But she was prettier than Loos. Eighty-nine years old she was still working for Knopf four days a week, doing the same work she had done for Simon & Schuster way back when--reading manuscripts, <b>writing</b> <b>flap</b> copy, helping with the ads, originating book titles, fighting for the books she thought must be acquired." ...|$|E

5000|$|The glottal stop, written -c, only occurs after a vowel and Pilhofer first {{describes}} it as a vowel feature that distinguishes, for instance, bo 'sugarcane' from boc 'very' and si 'planting' from sic 'broth'. However, McElhanon (1974) notes that final glottal stop is barely phonemic in the Wemo dialect, but corresponds to {{a wider variety of}} syllable-final consonants in Western Huon languages (-p, -t, -k, -m, -n, -ŋ), which are neutralized (to -c, -ŋ) in the Eastern Huon languages, including Kâte. Pilhofer (1933) <b>writes</b> the lateral <b>flap</b> with an l, but Schneuker (1962) and Flierl and Strauss (1977) write it with an r.|$|R
5000|$|Early Minialuxe {{vehicles}} came {{in simple}} cardboard cartons without plastic windows and illustrated with colorful standard artwork of the cars. 'Minialuxe' or 'Jouet Minialuxe' was <b>written</b> on the <b>flaps</b> commonly with {{the color of}} the car indicated. Colors were bright and saturated blues yellows, pinks and reds. No matter the model inside, Simcas and Peugeots were commonly shown on each early box, emphasizing French origins (Minialuxe Forum website). The flaps said [...] "Les Grandes Marques Francaises" [...] ("The Great French Makes"). In the 1970s, similar to the early German Cursor company, models were offered in a clear flimsy plastic 'box' with a cardboard base.|$|R

In these papers, Langley <b>wrote</b> that birds <b>flap</b> their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of ailerons. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions, and in 1901 {{wrote a letter to}} St. Nicholas magazine with his own ideas. The editor of [...] St. Nicholas declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly {{with a certain amount of}} intelligence and that [...] "machines will not act with such intelligence." [...] Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.|$|R

Digital imageHermann Struck was born Chaim Aaron ben David in 1876 in Germany. He is best known as a master etcher, lithographer, and early Zionist. He studied for five years at the Berlin Academy and, in 1908, wrote Die Kunst des Radierens (The Art of Etching), while mentoring artists such as Marc Chagall, Max Liebermann, and Lesser Ury. His art was included in an exhibition at the Fifth Zionist Congress and he helped establish the religious Zionist movement called Mizrachi. Struck was an Orthodox Jew but believed that culture and religion could thrive cooperatively in Israel. He immigrated to Haifa where he created an artistic community and participated {{in the development of the}} Tel Aviv Museum and the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem. He died in 1944...|$|R

40|$|Writing history 7 - 11 {{supports}} {{students and}} primary teachers {{helping them to}} explore ways in which activities involving the talk that underpins historical enquiry can be developed into reading and exciting, extended, reflective writing. The step that teachers and pupils take from ‘talk for learning’ to ‘talk for writing’ is a vital one. In this book {{the authors argue that}} all aspects of historical enquiry leading to writing involve discussion and dialogue which permeate every aspect of ‘doing history’. From this perspective they set out a theoretical framework for understanding the role of talk and reading in developing pupils’ critical thinking and confident reflective writing, then demonstrate through a series of case studies, in which teachers, university lecturers and pupils work together, how the theory is put into practice in the classroom. Themes include: • How to support children in writing in a variety of interesting genres • How to make links between the National Curriculum (2013) for History and for English • How to plan for breadth and depth studies in the new National Curriculum • How activities in History 5 – 11 can be developed into exciting extended writing The second half of the book draws upon case studies from a number of real primary classrooms with children of different ages. Each case study shows how teaching was planned to develop children’s confidence and enjoyment in discussion and to scaffold reasoned, written explanation and argument. Topics presented are all relevant to the new curriculum framework and include talking and reading about: • Time, change and significance over 6000 years - writing a television script • Celtic Britain and the Roman Army - writing a travel brochure about Celtic Britain • The destruction of Roman towns - writing a Saxon poem • An archaeological investigation of a body in a Danish peat bog - writing a newspaper report • Did any countries benefit from WW 11 ? - writing an argued viewpoint • The expansion westwards of European settlers - <b>writing</b> a <b>flap</b> book exploring different perspectives. This indispensable book provides not only sources for pupils to use in their writing, but also models and exemplars of different styles and voices to draw upon...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the mail}} went by coach the sending {{of letters and}} parcels could not but be expensive. Heavy goods {{travelled}} by waggon, barge, or ship, parcels went by carriers or by coaches, and nothing could be posted but what was quite light. So postage was very expensive, and it is strange {{to look back on}} the regulations connected with it. Our readers under forty years old will hardly believe the rates that were paid for postage, varying according to distance. There was a company in London that carried letters from one part of that town to another for twopence apiece, and this was the cheapest post in England. A letter from London to Otterbourne cost eightpence, and one from Winchester either threepence or fourpence, one from Devonshire elevenpence, and this was paid not by the sender, but by the receiver. It was reckoned impolite to prepay a letter. Moreover, the letter had to be on a single sheet. The sheet might be of any size that could be had, but it must be only one. A small sheet enclosed within another, or the lightest thing, such as a lock of hair or a feather, made it a double letter, for which double postage had to be given. The usual custom was to write on quarto sheets twice the size of what is used now, and, after filling three sides, to fold the fourth, leaving a space for the direction and the seal, and then to <b>write</b> on the <b>flaps</b> and in the space over [...] "My dear ---," [...] sometimes crossing the writing till the whole letter was chequer work. For if the letter was to cost the receiver so much, it seemed fair to let him get as much as possible. Letters were almost always sealed, and it took neat and practised hands to fold and seal them nicely, without awkward corners sticking out.|$|R
