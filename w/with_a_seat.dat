5|$|In a {{twist on}} The Mansion of Happiness, McLoughlin Brothers and Parker Brothers {{released}} several {{games in the}} late 1880s based on the then-popular Algeresque rags to riches theme. Games such as Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded, Messenger Boy, Game of the Telegraph Boy, and The Office Boy allowed players to emulate the successful capitalist. Players began these games as company underlings, newbies, or gofers, and, with luck, won the game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the President's Office (rather than a seat in Heaven, as in The Mansion of Happiness) or as Head of the Firm. In Parker Brothers' The Office Boy, spaces designating carelessness, inattentiveness, and dishonesty sent the player back on the track while spaces designating capability, earnestness, and honesty advanced him toward the goal. Such games reflected {{the belief that the}} enterprising American– regardless of his background, humble or privileged– would be rewarded under the American capitalist system, and insinuated that success was equated with increased social status via the accumulation of wealth.|$|E

In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802.

25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> {{on each side of the}} aisle, as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to step over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E
