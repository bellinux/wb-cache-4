40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study devoted to the problem of improving the energy efficiency of mechanical motion of anthropomorphic robotic systems. Achieving higher energy efficiency is largely due to the implementation of improvements directly in the algorithms that ensure the movement of a robotic system. For this purpose, several existing analytical methods for solving the inverse kinematics problem for robotic <b>walking</b> <b>platforms</b> were analyzed. According to the survey, key areas where modification can improve the energy efficiency of mechanical motion in various RS are identified.

40|$|Part 5 : Robotic Systems - IInternational audienceSimple human gait can be difficult, unfeasible and {{not always}} {{practical}} in Virtual Reality, because of spatial and technological limitations. For 3 D virtual environment travelling, different <b>walking</b> <b>platforms</b> have been developed {{in the last few}} years, but navigation using most of them is far from bringing naturalness to the user’s movements. Users sometimes are unsecure and they are trying to adapt and to correct any irregularities they feel. Our research is focused on specific walking patterns that characterize the intention of walking: starting walking with a certain speed, maintaining a desired speed, accelerated walking, decelerated walking, stopping. In laboratory conditions, using a motion capturing system, these behaviors were reproduced, measured and analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Legged robots {{are able}} to move across {{irregular}} terrains and some can be energy efficient, but are often constrained by a limited range of gaits which can limit their locomotion capabilities considerably. This paper reports a reconfigurable design approach to robotic legged locomotion that produces {{a wide variety of}} gait cycles, opening new possibilities for innovative applications. In this paper, we present a distance-based formulation and its application to solve the position analysis problem of a standard Theo Jansen mechanism. By changing the configuration of a linkage, our objective in this study is to identify novel gait patterns of interest for a <b>walking</b> <b>platform.</b> The exemplary gait variations presented in this work demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, and considerably extend the capabilities of the original design to not only produce novel cum useful gait patterns but also to realize behaviors beyond locomotion...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{presents}} a new locomotion interface that {{allows users to}} engage into a life-like walking experience within virtual environments while sensing and feeling terrain’s topology such as slopes and uneven ground surfaces. The interface is composed of a turntable as <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> within which four load sensors are embedded to track user’s walking actions. Virtual ground surface is generated by a tilting mechanism {{that is based on}} three air cylinders mounted beneath the turntable. The usage of turntable is to keep users facing the screen center all the time. Such approach is necessary where projection system do not provide surrounding visual feedback (360 o). The interface is proven to be simple and easy to use as demonstrated by an experimental evaluation. Such locomotion interface would be of interest to many human-scale virtual environments such as CAVE, DOME, and Display wall...|$|E

40|$|Many {{computer}} based simulations rely on conventional navigation {{methods such as}} a joystick and keyboard to enable the user to navigate around the virtual environment. In most cases, this constrains the users and prevents them from actually walking around in the synthesized environment as they would in a real environment. In some instances of safety oriented simulations this may create a false impression {{of the difficulty of}} the tasks to be undertaken and the complexity of the environment. This thesis project presents a new method for omni-directional locomotion in the virtual environment. The method involved invention of a mechanical <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> and development of the software tracking mechanism that runs real-time on commodity hardware. At the end of the project, a formal usability assessment of the system was conducted to evaluate the users' acceptance of the system. The mechanical <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> is relatively inexpensive and very robust for regular usage. The geometry of the platform allows the user to walk in a natural fashion without the need of active motors, increasing the user's safety while allowing much greater immersiveness compared to handheld devices such as a joystick or a mouse. The software component of the system is comprised of the tracking module and the visualisation module. Camera based tracking was chosen as the research direction of the tracking module in this project due to its low-cost and robustness. Three different approaches were developed and assessed; markerless tracking, marker-based parallel-camera tracking and marker-based multi-camera tracking. The visualisation module is composed of custom-built visualisation software incorporating visual widgets that give real-time feedback to the user. The combined features of the tracking module and the visualisation module allow the user to learn to use the system quickly without significant formal training. Many open-source software libraries were used to accelerate the software development. However, significant software development effort was still necessary because significant parts of the needed functionalities are not available off-the-shelf...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative sensing approach allowing capture, discrimination, and classification of transients automatically in gait. A <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> is described, which offers an alternative design {{to that of}} standard force plates with advantages that include mechanical simplicity and less restriction on dimensions. The scope {{of the work is}} to investigate as an experiment the sensitivity of the distributive tactile sensing method with the potential to address flexibility on gait assessment, including patient targeting and the extension to a variety of ambulatory applications. Using infrared sensors to measure plate deflection, gait patterns are compared with stored templates using a pattern recognition algorithm. This information is input into a neural network to classify normal and affected walking events, with a classification accuracy of just under 90 per cent achieved. The system developed has potential applications in gait analysis and rehabilitation, whereby it {{can be used as a}} tool for early diagnosis of walking disorders or to determine changes between pre- and post-operative gait...|$|E
40|$|The {{automated}} sensing scheme {{described in}} this paper {{has the potential to}} automatically capture, discriminate and classify transients in gait. The mechanical simplicity of the <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> offers advantages over standard force plates. There is less restriction on dimensions offering the opportunity for multi-contact and multiple steps. This addresses the challenge of patient targeting and the evaluation of patients in a variety of ambulatory applications. In this work the sensitivity of the distributive tactile sensing method has been investigated experimentally. Using coupled time series data from a small number of sensors, gait patterns are compared with stored templates using a pattern recognition algorithm. By using a neural network these patterns were interpreted classifying normal and affected walking events with an accuracy of just under 90 %. This system has potential in gait analysis and rehabilitation as a tool for early diagnosis in walking disorders, for determining response to therapy and for identifying changes between pre and post operative gait...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{the thesis}} is to study and {{replicate}} quadruped movement {{in the hopes of}} utilizing its biological behaviour to integrate in machinery and aid work undertaken in industrial environments. The thesis focuses on the design, build and programming of a quadruped <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> for the main purpose of showcasing, industrial grade carrying purposes as well as a potential teaching tool. Inspired by the biological movements of quadruped animals, the machine must be able to efficiently move from one point to another with sufficient reactive control, while simultaneously carrying significant weight. The control of the overall machine will be done through a microcontroller, actuating different parts of the machine while sensing its current states. The challenges faced during this thesis centred on the mimicking of biological behaviour and motion: Quadrupeds move around using a combination of synchronised leg movements and environmental sensory feedback. Replicating this behaviour proved to be difficult, even at a simpler scale. Ideally the project must be able to accommodate the continuation of work by future students, by providing any additional appropriate documents...|$|E
40|$|The {{class of}} Discrete Event Systems (DES) are systems {{of which the}} {{dynamics}} consist of the occurrences of discrete events in the time domain. Typical examples of DES from everyday life are transport systems, production facilities or communication systems. Recently legged locomotion has been adressed {{from the point of}} view of DES. Here, the continuous motion of each leg is represented by the discrete touch-down and lift-off event of the feet. This abstraction allows for a novel approach in the control of legged robotic platforms. A certain sub-class of DES, the so called Max-Plus Linear (MPL) -DES can be described in a linear fashion using max-plus algebra. An extension to MPL models is the class of Switching Max-Plus Linear (SMPL) models. This extension is used to describe DES that can switch between different modes of operation. In each mode the system is described by a unique MPL state space model. Because of the algebraic structure of the max-plus algebra, stable transient dynamics are guaranteed during a switch of mode of operation. However, very little research has been done on how to decide which mode of operation to switch to, possibly given a certain set of information. This thesis focuses on the development of such methods. In particular, it has been researched how to select the appropriate mode of operation as a function of the measured disturbances and the environment the MPL system operates within. The problem of selecting the most appropriate mode of operation is recast as an optimization problem in a feedback control setting. For the development of such methods an analysis of the structure of MPL state space models is performed. Moreover, it is analysed how one can model disturbances in a MPL framework. Finally, the ordinal optimization method has been extended to incorporate learning. Two feedback methods have been developed. The first is the so called reactive feedback loop. It uses the structural information of the MPL system to mitigate disturbances as fast as possible. The second feedback method is named the deliberate loop. In the deliberate loop a certain performance function is learned as a function of the disturbances, mode of operation and the environment. Then in the optimization procedure to goal is to find the mode of operation that minimizes the approximated performance function. The deliberate feedback method has been implemented on the Zebro, a hexapod robotic <b>walking</b> <b>platform</b> using SMPL models to schedule and control the walking pattern. It has been confirmed that the algorithm optimizes the mode of operation if the performance function is known. However, more experimental data is needed to claim anything about the learning capabilities of the algorithm in practice.
