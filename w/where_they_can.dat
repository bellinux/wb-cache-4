The Pont de la Concorde contains stones reused from the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> become {{pulsating}} variables.

5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> eat them.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den {{is often}} surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers, or because they have survived capture.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention.

Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (<b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{radiated power}} (ERP) of the Green Pine also makes it a possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles.

5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} {{regularly}} encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, {{with the best}} sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted {{in the summer and}} fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December. Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage.|$|E

5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E

The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible {{that there is a}} progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
