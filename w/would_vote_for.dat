5|$|Republican {{legislative}} {{leaders said}} that they would not whip their members to vote for Shumlin, leaving them free to vote their consciences. Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote, he said that he <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Shumlin, and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright said that he would do so. Initially, no Democrats indicated that they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Milne. Indeed, several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin {{said that they}} <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Shumlin, citing his plurality win.|$|E
5|$|After Milne's announcement, Independent State Representative Paul Poirier, {{a liberal}} whose {{district}} voted for Milne by a 2-to-1 margin, {{announced that he}} <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Milne. One Democrat, State Representative Jim Condon, said that he <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Milne, also citing his district's support for Milne over Shumlin. Political science professors Eric Davis and Garrison Nelson and House Minority Leader Don Turner expected the General Assembly vote to roughly follow party lines, with Milne receiving {{about one-third of the}} votes, including most of the Republicans and a few Democrats and Independents.|$|E

While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E

5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and the PC Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per cent of the population {{were satisfied with the}} PC government. 75 per cent <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her {{government and the}} PC Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the PC Party in an election. 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|Polling firm Public Policy Polling {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} Giron's district between September 7 and 9, asking likely voters if they supported the recall of Giron, whether they supported various components of the gun control bill, whether they approved of the NRA and Governor Hickenlooper, and who they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> in a hypothetical 2014 gubernatorial election between Hickenlooper and Republican Tom Tancredo, as well as various methodological questions. The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E

5|$|Within the United States armed forces, {{according}} to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73percent of military personnel said that they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Bush, 18percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist {{who has studied the}} political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because they found him more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was the best choice for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party in an election.|$|E
5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E

5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within the rank and file of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E
5|$|Three Democratic {{candidates}} {{had announced}} intentions {{to run for}} governor in 1899—Goebel, former Kentucky Attorney General P. Wat Hardin, and former congressman William J. Stone. Hardin, a native of Mercer County, had the backing of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Lyon County's Stone had the backing of the state's agricultural interests. Goebel generally had the backing of urban voters. Going into the party's nominating convention, Hardin was the favorite to win the nomination. Knowing that combining forces {{was the only way to}} prevent Hardin's nomination, representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19, 1899, to work out a deal. According to Urey Woodson, a Goebel representative at the meeting, the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation, which was committed to Goebel, <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Stone. Both men agreed that, should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race, they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because she told him she <b>would</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E
