My plan was to make use of the monarchy, which he opposed absolutely. His plan was to raise up the people to abolish the monarchy, with which I absolutely disagreed. In other words, he and I were pursuing one and the same goal, but our means were considerably different. He wished to start by relying on the French to abolish the monarchy, but I wished to start by driving out the French to restore Vietnam - That was the difference. However, even though his political view was the opposite of mine, he liked me personally a great deal and we roomed together for several weeks.

5000|$|Described as [...] "mysticism versus {{consumerism}} with a mega dose {{of twisted}} humor," [...] the story represented beliefs deep and personal to creator Lorne Lanning - that [...] "great art reflects back on us not necessarily {{what we want}} to see, but what we need to face." [...] For Lanning, those beliefs infused his characterisation of the planet Oddworld, with Abe's Oddysee touching on just a small aspect of the larger picture that was the entire planet. His idea was for the theme of Oddworld to be [...] "heavily woven with the dark side of globalization, {{the dark side of the}} multi-national fallout upon the human condition" [...] and for his games to touch on examples of those themes, in the case of Abe's Oddysee, capitalism, third world exploitation, the environment and the fast food industry with respect to the plight of the diamond miners in South Africa and the De Beers cartel that dominate diamond trading. Lanning disliked [...] "what capitalism did to the little guy," [...] and [...] "wanted to create a meaningful dark reflection of our dysfunctional world, wrapped up in a fantasy world, where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the craziness of our capitalism, but with a funny bone approach." [...] And this anti-capitalist view infused the deeper meaning of Abe's Oddysee as the socio-economic element of the story was set amongst the lower class [...] "slaving away in unsafe conditions, unwillingly bending to the will of corporate suits... to earn a few bucks for a day's worth of grueling, often unrewarding work" [...] The protagonist fighting back against his oppressors, the Glukkons, represented Lanning's desire for people in the real world to fight back against the [...] "abominable behavior of the world's most greedy multi-national corporations," [...] characterised by [...] "caricatures of CEOs, all power-suits and cigars." [...] It should also be noted that the Glukkons play a minor role in the gameplay of Abe's Oddysee, and are only seen in the game's cutscenes. This was intentional, as Lanning wanted the primary antagonist to be the RuptureFarms factory itself. [...] "The corporation is above and beyond any of its executives or employees -- or slaves. So by making players defeat RuptureFarms as the end boss... we thought it would add a bigger sense of climax." [...] This story was important to Lanning because he feels [...] "it’s the artist’s role to create new myths that are relevant to the changing times of our world, and to bring some shining direction to our more troubling challenges." ...|$|E

This publication examines the rise of LGBTIQ rights within development and asks how the terms of debate have shifted {{so much that the}} industry’s most powerful multilateral institution and champion of neoliberal capitalism, the World Bank, is advocating protection rights for sexual minorities. The author focuses upon the growth in interest and financial resources towards the rescue of non-heterosexual people from homophobia in Global South countries and the problematic rise in homonationalism. More encouragingly, he also explores how communities within developing country contexts have challenged rigid heteronormative conceptions of love, desire and affection...|$|E
