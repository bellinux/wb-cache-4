40|$|This {{monograph}} is {{a comprehensive}} study of the combinatorial structure of various operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> and undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Our first main objective is to prove a finite presentation theorem for each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> describing each one in terms {{of just a few}} operadic generators and a small number of generating relations. For example, the operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 8 generators and 28 generating relations, while the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 6 generators and 17 generating relations. Our second main objective is to prove a corresponding finite presentation theorem for algebras over each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> As applications we provide finite presentations for the propagator algebra, the algebra of discrete systems, the algebra of open dynamical systems, and the (typed) relational algebra. We also provide a partial verification of Spivak's conjecture regarding the quotient-freeness of the relational algebra. Our third main objective is to construct explicit operad maps among the several operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> In particular, there is a surjective operad map from the operad of all <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> including delay nodes, to the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This monograph is intended for graduate students, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers interested in operads and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Assuming no prior knowledge of categories, operads, and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> this monograph is self-contained and {{can be used as a}} supplement in a graduate course and for independent study. There are over 100 graphical illustrations and a chapter with a list of problems. Comment: 302 pages. Substantially revised. New material includes: (i) a reading guide in the introduction of each of the three parts; (ii) a chapter summary at the end of each chapter from Ch. 2 to Ch. 13; (iii) new Ch. 15 on Further Reading; (iv) 30 new examples, 36 new pictures, and 27 new paragraphs of motivatio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two types of sockets of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard type of socket system needs its <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to test nonstandard socket along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> as it has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked. Also use of other made hardware than national instruments with LabVIEW is described in nonstandard type socket testing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> as seen {{in digital}} circuits, can be nested hierarchically and thus have an aspect of self-similarity. We show that <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> form the morphisms of an operad, {{capturing}} this self-similarity. We discuss the algebra of mathematical relations on, {{and in so doing}} use <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> as a graphical language with which to structure queries on relational databases. We give the example of circuit diagrams as a special case. We move on to show how plug-and-play devices and also recursion can be formulated in the operadic framework as well. Throughout we include many examples and figures. Comment: 28 page...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> usually gives {{information}} about the relative position and arrangement of devices and terminals on the devices, to help in building or servicing the device. This is unlike a schematic diagram, where {{the arrangement of the}} components' interconnections on the diagram usually does not correspond to the components' physical locations in the finished device. A pictorial diagram would show more detail of the physical appearance, whereas a <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> uses a more symbolic notation to emphasize interconnections over physical appearance.|$|R
40|$|Ingredients for a brain In {{thinking}} about {{components of the}} brain that are important for mental function, there are several obvious things to consider. The brain’s <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> embodied by the structural connectivity, is one feature. Graph theory metrics applied to anatomical networks have shown patterns that are consistent with a small-world network with dense local connections and sparser distal connections (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009). This imparts an advantage in information processing capacity compared to <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> that are either random or more regular (e. g. lattice). Studies of the brain’s <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> also suggest the presence of regions that act as hubs, connecting local territories of specialized processing (Hagmann et al., 2008; Honey and Sporns, 2008). On top of the anatomical architecture, to capture function one would need to consider which nodes are active at a particular time and ho...|$|R

40|$|Finite {{dynamical}} systems (e. g. Boolean {{networks and}} logical models) {{have been used}} in modeling biological systems to focus attention on the qualitative features of the system, such as the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram.</b> Since the analysis of such systems is hard, it is necessary to focus on subclasses that have the properties of being general enough for modeling and simple enough for theoretical analysis. In this paper we propose the class of AND-NOT networks for modeling biological systems and show that it provides several advantages. Some of the advantages include: Any finite dynamical system can be written as an AND-NOT network with similar dynamical properties. There is a one-to-one correspondence between AND-NOT networks, their <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and their dynamics. Results about AND-NOT networks can be stated at the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> level without losing any information. Results about AND-NOT networks are applicable to any Boolean network. We apply our results to a Boolean model of Th-cell differentiation...|$|R
