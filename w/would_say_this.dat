[...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E

There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

As you get older it's more interesting to have a theme that everything tries to support – I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> album [...] has a theme. I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997 {{the band}} {{recorded}} Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It {{is considered by}} many to be the best representation of their [...] "classic" [...] sound, and songs such as [...] "Lucky the Donkey," [...] "Do the Hustle," [...] "Lipstick" [...] and [...] "Perfect World" [...] became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic felt [...] "...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the {{listener}} – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart {{with a healthy}} dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam." [...] Q magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated [...] "It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record." [...] BBC Collective said [...] "It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. I never thought i <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> but Back To Bedlam has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure." [...] Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that [...] "Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience" [...] and that though [...] "Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death" [...] that it's [...] "More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke." ...|$|E

[...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, then let it be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms clods, then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, so that your people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another. [...] And do not heed the prayer of travelers that it not rain.” The Rabbis of Caesarea added, “And concerning your people, Israel, that they not exercise dominion over one another.” And for {{the people who live in}} the Sharon plain he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> prayer, “May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that our houses not turn into our graves.”.|$|E
