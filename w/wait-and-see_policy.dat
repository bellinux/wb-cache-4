40|$|This master thesis {{develops}} a stochastic optimisation software for household grid-connected batteries combined with PV-systems. The {{objective of the}} optimisation is to operate the battery system in order to minimise {{the costs of the}} consumer, and it was implemented in MATLAB using a self-written stochastic dynamic programming algorithm. Load was considered as a stochastic variable and modelled as a Markov Chain. Transition probabilities between time steps were calculated using historic load patterns from up to three previous years, exploiting the repetitive patterns of weekdays and weekends.  PV-production was considered deterministic when included. The SDP-model was tested on data from Norwegian households for 2016, and the global optimum solution was used as a benchmark, as found using the dynamic programming model from the project work. As Norwegian households were used as test cases, the Nordic power market Nord Pool Spot sat the scene for market transaction calculations. Day-ahead spot prices were used as market prices, meaning that the prices for the coming day was considered deterministic from noon the present day. The fixed 24 -hour horizon optimisation was performed at midnight for each day, yielding an optimal <b>wait-and-see</b> operational <b>policy</b> for the battery system. The optimisation was investigated under three different utility tariff (UT) structures: Energy based, time based and power based. The energy based UT is a fixed price per kWh, which is what is being used in today's market. The time based UT is a time-of-use tariff, which penalised use during peak demand hours 9 - 11 and 17 - 19 in weekdays. The power based UT increases linearly with the demand, designed to limit the power usage at any given time and day. While the energy based UT is what is being used as of today, the widespread roll-out of advanced metering systems (AMS) by 2019 in the Norwegian market will enable UT structures such as the time- and power based ones studied in this thesis. The global optimal solution achieved 1. 2 % (energy based UT), 14. 2 % (time based UT) and 8. 6 % (power based UT) of operational savings without a PV-system, illustrating the negligible potential for saving under the energy based UT. The developed SDP-model achieved 75 - 92 and 87 - 94 % of the global optimal savings without a PV-system under the energy- and time based utility tariff, respectively. This is increased to 92 - 99 % and 91 - 96 % with the PV-system installed.  Under the power based utility tariff the model shows less promising results, scoring a maximum of 25 - 44 % of the global optimal solution without a PV-system, and 75 - 90 % with...|$|R

40|$|Background: Lateral {{epicondylitis}} {{is generally}} treated with corticosteroid injections or physiotherapy. Dutch clinical guidelines recommend a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy.</b> We compared {{the efficacy of}} these approaches. Methods: Patients with lateral epicondylitis of at least 6 weeks' duration were recruited by family doctors. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 6 weeks of treatment with corticosteroid injections, physiotherapy, or a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy.</b> Outcome measures included general improvement, severity of the main complaint, pain, elbow disability, and patient satisfaction. Severity of elbow complaints, grip strength, and pressure pain threshold were assessed by a research physiotherapist who was unaware of treatment allocation. We assessed all outcomes at 3, 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The principal analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Findings: We randomly assigned 185 patients. At 6 weeks, corticosteroid injections were significantly better than all other therapy options for all outcome measures. Success rates were 92 % (57) compared with 47 % (30) for physiotherapy and 32 % (19) for <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy.</b> However, recurrence rate in the injection group was high. Long-term differences between injections and physiotherapy were significantly in favour of physiotherapy.

40|$|Objective: Lateral {{epicondylitis}} is {{a common}} complaint, with an annual incidence between 1 % and 3 % in the general population. The Dutch College of General Practitioners in The Netherlands has issued guidelines that recommend a wait- and-see policy. However, these guidelines are not evidence based. Design and setting: This paper {{presents the results of}} an economic evaluation in conjunction with a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of three interventions in primary care for patients with lateral epicondylitis. Patients and interventions: Patients with pain at the lateral side of the elbow were randomised to one of three interventions: a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy,</b> corticosteroid injections or physiotherapy. Main outcome measures and results: Clinical outcomes included general improvement, pain during the day, elbow disability and QOL. The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective. Direct and indirect costs (in 1999 values) were measured by means of cost diaries over a period of 12 months. Differences in mean costs between groups were evaluated by applying non- parametric bootstrap techniques. The mean total costs per patient for corticosteroid injections were € 430, compared with € 631 for the <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> and € 921 for physiotherapy. After 12 months, the success rate in the physiotherapy group (91 %) was significantly higher than in the injection group (69 %), but only slightly higher than in the wait-and-see group (83 %). The differences in costs and effects showed no dominance for any of the three groups. The incremental cost- utility ratios were (approximately) : € 7 000 per utility gain for the <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> versus corticosteroid injections; € 12 000 per utility gain for physiotherapy versus corticosteroid injections, and € 34 500 for physiotherapy versus the wait- and-see policy.

40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} if subgroups {{of patients with}} tennis elbow respond differently in treatment. Methods. This study used individual patient data (n= 383) from two randomized controlled trials that investigated a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy,</b> corticosteroid injections and physiotherapy. Common outcome measures were: pain severity, global improvement, severity assessed by a blinded assessor, elbow disability and pain free grip strength. Subgroup analyses for previous history of elbow pain, baseline pain severity, duration of the current episode and employment status were performed at 6 and 52 weeks. Results. Patients 2 ̆ 7 age, previous elbow symptoms and baseline pain severity were similar between trials, but other characteristics differed between trial populations. Based on individual patient data from both trials, we found that corticosteroid injections were statistically and clinically superior at 6 weeks, but significantly worse at 52 weeks compared with both wait-and-see and physiotherapy. Subgroup effects were scarce and small. Patients with higher baseline pain score showed less benefit on pain outcomes between physiotherapy and a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> at 6 weeks. It also appeared that non-manual workers who had an injection were the only work subgroup to follow the general trend that injections were significantly worse than a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> on global improvement at 52 weeks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{operated}} {{on for the}} most common benign pathologies of the orbital cavity-optic nerve glioma, sheath meningioma and neurinoma-should be surgically treated. However, postoperative visual impairment is frequently inevitable. A <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> due to a slow {{rate of growth of}} these lesions is criticized. METHODS: Collecting data from three series of patients operated, we compare the surgical procedures and long-term results. RESULTS: "En bloc" removal in patients with optic nerve glioma led to complete visual deficit but ensures excellent long-term prognosis. Because optic nerve meningiomas are typically circumferential to the optic nerve and adhere tightly to the perineural pial microvascular structures, it is impossible to avoid trauma to the optic nerve and recurrences. Patients with neurinoma of the orbital cavity have the most favourable prognosis both in terms of visual function as well as long-term quality of life. Due to its slow rate of growth, a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> can be adopted for optic nerve glioma before deciding on surgical removal, whereas surgical treatment of meningioma may be postponed if symptoms are slight and steady. Removal of orbital cavity neurinoma should not be postponed since surgical outcome is excellent...|$|E
40|$|Pleural lipomas are benign tumours {{that develop}} {{at the expense}} of adipose tissues, and they never evolve towards liposarcoma. Located usually at the mediastinal, {{bronchial}} and pulmonary levels, a pleural situation is extremely rare. Chest X-rays usually detect them and computed tomography scans confirm the diagnosis. As complications occur, a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> is common. We report our pleural lipoma surgical exeresis experience since 1999. We have operated on five cases of pleural lipomas among nearly 1800 cases of thoracic exeresis: three male and two female patients, without obesity (in all cases, body mass index (BMI) < 28). The mean age was 54. 6 years (range 35 – 72 years). Four patients were electively operated and one in emergency, three with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) procedure and two with open chest surgery, without recurrent cases. Advancements in VATS have greatly reduced the morbidity rate of these benign tumours especially if exeresis is performed early on a small, uncomplicated adhesion-free tumour. On the other hand, the operation may be deleterious, complicated by the presence of a large lipoma or in a complicating situation. In our opinion, we should revise the <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> when facing these lesions considering their evolutionary potential. We should advise VATS in pleural lipomas...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the new L 95 P mutation of the paraganglioma 1 gene for glomus tumors in a Dutch paraganglioma 1 family with six affected {{family members and}} to report the clinical findings and results of treatment in nine glomus tumors with a maximum follow-up of 34 years. SETTING: Tertiary referral centers. RESULTS: Mutation analysis of the SDHD gene of paraganglioma 1 showed the L 95 P mutation in six affected family members and two nonaffected carriers protected from becoming affected by genomic imprinting. In six affected family members, nine glomus tumors (five glomus caroticum tumors, two glomus vagale tumors, and two glomus jugulare tumors) were traced. The ages at presentation varied from 25 to 61 years. In two of six affected family members {{with a total of}} four tumors, all the tumors were traced in the extended family study, using magnetic resonance imaging; at that time these tumors were silent. After radiotherapy in one patient at the age of 34 years, a T 4 planocellular carcinoma of the tongue occurred within the previous radiation field 27 years later, when the patient was 61 years old. Volume measurements of three untreated glomus tumors (two glomus vagale tumors, one glomus caroticum tumor) during 25 months showed an increase in two tumors (left glomus caroticum, left glomus vagale tumor) and a decrease in one tumor (right glomus vagale tumor). Surgery to remove two bilateral and one unilateral glomus caroticum tumors was successful. A <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> is being applied to two glomus vagale tumors.

40|$|Background Patients who undergo {{endoscopic}} sphincterotomy {{for common}} bile-duct stones, who have residual gallbladder stones, are referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, only 10 % {{of patients who}} do not have this operation are reported to develop recurrent biliary symptoms. We aimed to assess whether a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> is justified. Methods We did a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial in 120 patients (age 18 - 80 years) who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction, with proven gallbladder stones. Patients were randomly allocated to wait and see (n= 64) or laparoscopic cholecystectomy (56). Primary outcome was reoccurrence of at least one biliary event during 2 -year follow-up, and secondary outcomes were complications of cholecystectomy and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings 12 patients were lost to follow-up immediately. Of 59 patients allocated to wait and see, 27 (47 %) had recurrent biliary symptoms compared with one (2 %) of 49 patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (relative risk 22 - 42, 95 % CI 3. 16 - 159. 14, p < 0. 0001). 22 (81 %) of 27 patients underwent cholecystectomy, mainly for biliary pain (n= 13) or acute cholecystitis (7). Conversion rate to open surgery was 55 % in patients allocated to wait and see who underwent cholecystectomy compared with 23 % in those who were allocated laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p= 0. 0104). Morbidity was 32 % versus 14 % (p= 0. 1048), and median hospital stay was 9 versus 7 days. Quality of life returned to normal within 3 months after either treatment policy. Interpretation A <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> after endoscopic sphincterotomy in. combined cholecystodocholithiasis cannot be recommended as standard treatment, since 47 % of expectantly managed patients developed at least one recurrent biliary event and 37 % needed cholecystectomy. No major biliary complications arose, but conversion rate was hig...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> for {{patients}} with stage I nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (NSTGCT) was evaluated in a prospective study. The frequency and time of recurrence, detection of recurrence, and presence of unfavorable prognostic factors were investigated. Patients and Methods: During the period 1982 to 1992, 154 patients with stage I NSTGCT (median age, 29 years) underwent orchidectomy and were monitored at follow-up evaluation with physical examinations, alfafetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human choriogonadotropin (hCG) levels, chest x-rays (CXR), and computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and chest. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Results: During a median follow-up period of 7 years (range, 2 to 12), recurrence was found in 42 patients (27. 3 %). All cases of recurrence were detected within 2 years, 90 % {{in the first year}} after orchidectomy. In 29 patients (69. 0 %), recurrence was detected in the abdominal lymph nodes. Nine patients (21. 4 %) had metastases in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum and/or lungs, and four patients (9. 6 %) had metastases only in the mediastinum or lungs. The majority of recurrences (97. 6 %) were detected by tumor markers and CT scans. Recurrence was related to the presence of vascular invasion, embryonal carcinoma (E), elevated preoperative hCG level, and absence of mature teratoma (M). Only vascular invasion was an independent risk factor. After polychemotherapy treatment for recurrence, the survival rate of the total group was 98. 7 %. Conclusion: The <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> is a reliable method for follow-up monitoring of patients with stage I NSTGCT. Even in patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, it is justified to await the possible appearance of metastases. For the future, it is recommended that CXR be omitted from the schedule, and it might be feasible to discontinue follow-up evaluations after 5 years...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryotherapy is {{effective}} for common warts, but for plantar warts available treatments often fail. OBJECTIVES: Within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we examined whether subgroups of common and plantar warts have a favourable natural course or response to treatment based on wart-associated HPV type. STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients with new common or plantar warts were recruited in 30 Dutch family practices. Patients (n= 250) were randomly allocated to liquid-nitrogen cryotherapy, 40 % salicylic acid self-application, or <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy.</b> Before treatment, swabs {{were taken from}} all separate warts and analysed by a broad spectrum HPV genotyping assay. At 13 weeks, cure rates with 95 % confidence intervals of common and plantar warts on intention to treat basis were compared between treatment arms for the different wart-associated HPV types. RESULTS: In total, 7 % of swabs tested negative for HPV DNA and 16 % contained multiple types, leaving 278 of 371 common swabs (75 %) and 299 of 373 plantar swabs (80 %) with a single type for analysis. After <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy,</b> cure rates were 2 / 70 (3 %, 95 % confidence interval 1 - 10) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated common warts, 4 / 58 (7 %, 3 - 16) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated plantar warts, and 21 / 36 (58 %, 42 - 73) for HPV 1 -associated plantar warts. After cryotherapy, cure rates were 30 / 44 (68 %, 53 - 80), 6 / 56 (11 %, 5 - 21), and 15 / 23 (65 %, 45 - 81); after salicylic acid 16 / 87 (18 %, 12 - 28), 15 / 60 (25 %, 16 - 37), and 24 / 26 (92 %, 76 - 98), respectively.

40|$|We examine empirically whether {{financial}} asset prices may be admitted into the ECB interest rate rule. A correctly specified monetary policy rule {{implying that the}} ECB reacts to stock prices movements must include some measure of the gap between actual stock prices and fundamental values. We develop an original methodology to measure such a deviation, and we employed it as argument in an augmented interest rate rule. The empirical evidence suggests the following description of the European central banker: he significantly reacts to {{financial asset}} prices, by raising (lowering) the ECB main interest rate when stock prices are over(under) -evaluated; he is partisan of a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy,</b> reacting only when the price gap is quite important; and he seems rather little conservative, believing that asset prices are driven mainly by nonfundamental factors...|$|E
40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} a unilateral testicular granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma. Because {{of the relatively}} immature nature of the tumor cells, the histological diagnosis can be difficult. Granulocytic sarcomas are well known in patients with systemic leukemia and can sometimes precede a systemic leukemic outcome. A solitary granulocytic sarcoma not followed by a hematological proliferation of the myelocytic stem cells is very rare. No prognostic factors {{that are able to}} predict a systemic outcome are known. Therefore, in this case with no signs of systemic disease, we adopted a <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy</b> after radical orchidectomy. Up to now, after a follow-up period of 7 years, the patient is still free of disease. Diagnosis and therapy of this urologic disease are discussed and the literature is reviewed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} an accurate predictive model and a nomogram for pathologic complete response (pCR) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for rectal cancer based on clinical and sequential PET-CT data. Accurate prediction could enable more individualised surgical approaches, including less extensive resection {{or even a}} <b>wait-and-see</b> <b>policy.</b> METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population based databases from 953 patients were collected from four different institutes and divided into three groups: clinical factors (training: 677 patients, validation: 85 patients), pre-CRT PET-CT (training: 114 patients, validation: 37 patients) and post-CRT PET-CT (training: 107 patients, validation: 55 patients). A pCR was defined as ypT 0 N 0 reported by pathology after surgery. The data were analysed using a linear multivariate classification model (support vector machine), and the model's performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
