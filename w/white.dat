5|$|A <b>white</b> dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A <b>white</b> dwarf is very dense: its mass {{is comparable to}} that of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. A <b>white</b> dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a <b>white</b> dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known <b>white</b> dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight <b>white</b> dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of <b>white</b> dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name <b>white</b> dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E
5|$|According to Taylor, Russell {{discounted}} {{the fact}} that his career was facilitated by <b>white</b> people who were proven anti-racists, namely his <b>white</b> high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his <b>white</b> college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), <b>white</b> Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and <b>white</b> Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E

50|$|However, {{according}} to a study from the University of California at Berkeley, using data from over 1 million profiles of singles from online dating websites, <b>whites</b> were far more reluctant to date outside their race than non-whites. The study found that over 80% of <b>whites,</b> including <b>whites</b> who stated no racial preference, contacted other <b>whites,</b> whereas about 3% of <b>whites</b> contacted blacks, a result that held for younger and older participants. Only 5% of <b>whites</b> responded to inquiries from blacks.

5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} <b>white</b> dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a <b>white</b> dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a <b>white</b> dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a <b>white</b> dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The <b>white</b> dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Bethune also courted wealthy <b>white</b> organizations, {{such as the}} ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited {{influential}} <b>white</b> men to sit on {{her school}} board of trustees, gaining participation by James Gamble (of Procter & Gamble) and Thomas H. <b>White</b> (of <b>White</b> Sewing Machines). When Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute visited in 1912, he advised her {{of the importance of}} gaining support by <b>white</b> benefactors for funding. Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw <b>white</b> {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the <b>white</b> power structure. He argued that under apartheid, <b>white</b> people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, <b>white</b> people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed <b>white</b> people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that <b>white</b> South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1833 in Romney, Virginia (present-day West Virginia), <b>White</b> {{was the son}} of Hampshire County Court Clerk John Baker <b>White</b> and {{his second}} wife, Frances Ann Streit <b>White.</b> He was educated at the Romney Classical Institute, worked in his father's clerking office for six years, and studied {{jurisprudence}} under John <b>White</b> Brockenbrough at his Lexington Law School. <b>White</b> was admitted to the bar in 1854 and practiced law in Romney.|$|E

His older brother Robert <b>White</b> (1833–1915) later served as Attorney General of West Virginia. He was likely named for his maternal grandfather Reverend Christian Streit, a Lutheran minister of Winchester, Virginia, who was of Swiss descent. <b>White</b> received his education at Potomac Seminary in Romney.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a <b>white</b> dwarf will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this {{will increase}} the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a <b>white</b> dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass <b>white</b> dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass <b>white</b> dwarf and that the radius of a <b>white</b> dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E

The shirt {{bears no}} {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, <b>white</b> shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with a black and <b>white</b> stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a <b>white</b> shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, <b>white</b> shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and <b>white</b> kit. In past seasons <b>white</b> shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a <b>white</b> shirt with a red trim, black shorts and <b>white</b> socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, Adriaan van Maanen {{discovered}} Van Maanen's Star, {{an isolated}} <b>white</b> dwarf. These three <b>white</b> dwarfs, the first discovered, are the so-called classical <b>white</b> dwarfs., p.2 Eventually, many faint <b>white</b> stars were found which had high proper motion, {{indicating that they}} could be suspected to be low-luminosity stars close to the Earth, and hence <b>white</b> dwarfs. Willem Luyten appears to have been the first to use the term <b>white</b> dwarf when he examined this class of stars in 1922; the term was later popularized by Arthur Stanley Eddington. Despite these suspicions, the first non-classical <b>white</b> dwarf was not definitely identified until the 1930s. 18 <b>white</b> dwarfs had been discovered by 1939., p.3 Luyten and others continued to search for <b>white</b> dwarfs in the 1940s.
