2500|$|The {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Moniz's decision to hazard psychosurgery has been clouded by contradictory statements made on the subject by Moniz and others both contemporaneously and retrospectively. The traditional narrative addresses {{the question of why}} Moniz targeted the frontal lobes by way of reference to the work of the Yale neuroscientist John Fulton and, most dramatically, to a presentation Fulton made with his junior colleague Carlyle Jacobsen at the Second International Congress of Neurology held in London in 1935. Fulton's primary area of research was on the cortical function of primates and he had established America's first primate neurophysiology laboratory at Yale in the early 1930s. At the 1935 Congress, with Moniz in attendance, Fulton and Jacobsen presented two chimpanzees, named Becky and Lucy who had had frontal lobectomies and subsequent changes in behaviour and intellectual function. According to Fulton's account of the congress, they explained that prior to surgery, both animals, and especially Becky, the more emotional of the two, exhibited [...] "frustrational behaviour"that is, have tantrums that could include rolling on the floor and defecatingif, because of their poor performance in a set of experimental tasks, they were not rewarded. Following the surgical removal of their frontal lobes, the behaviour of both primates changed markedly and Becky was pacified {{to such a degree that}} Jacobsen apparently stated it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had joined a [...] "happiness cult". During the question and answer section of the paper, Moniz, it is alleged, [...] "startled" [...] Fulton by inquiring if this procedure might be extended to human subjects suffering from mental illness. Fulton stated that he replied that while possible in theory it was surely [...] "too formidable" [...] an intervention for use on humans.|$|E

5000|$|Season five {{introduces}} Buffy's younger [...] "sister", Dawn, {{who suddenly}} appears in Buffy's life. Although she {{is new to}} the series, to the characters it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has always <b>been</b> there.|$|R
2500|$|Chagall {{stayed in}} Saint Petersburg until 1910, often visiting Vitebsk {{where he met}} Bella Rosenfeld. In My Life, Chagall {{described}} his first meeting her: [...] "Her silence is mine, her eyes mine. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knows everything about my childhood, my present, my future, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can see right through me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will only}} <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> at school here," [...] Mr. Covington said. [...] "She {{will no doubt}} be taught to talk German and French, and even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is never able to {{converse}} in these languages, it will add to her pleasures <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can read them." ...|$|R
60|$|And to Birkin it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> killed Gerald, {{with that}} touch.|$|E
60|$|In missing it he was {{assisted}} by Amanda herself, who had at moments an effect upon {{him of a}} priestess confidentially disrobed. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> put aside for him something official, something sincerely maintained, necessary, but at times a little irksome. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was glad to take him into her confidence and unbend. Within the pre-natal Amanda an impish Amanda still lingered.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not pull}} away her hand; it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had not thought}} of it.|$|E
60|$|Margaret's pose <b>was</b> stiff, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> braced herself, but she smiled.|$|R
60|$|Jock was {{sufficiently}} tired to be quiescent in the nursery, where she kept him with her, feeling, in his wistful eyes, {{and even in}} poor little Armine's childish questions, something less like blank desolation than her recent apathy had <b>been,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> waking to thrills of pain after the numbness of a blow.|$|R
60|$|CAMILLE comes doubtfully up to {{the writing}} table. Her {{forehead}} <b>is</b> puckered <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> thinking hard.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had really}} been a little child, wanting the place kissed to make it well.|$|E
60|$|She trembled at his calm assurance. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> almost {{feared that}} what he said might come to pass.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> quite shook {{something}} out of her. [...] "But how will that help him if we--in spite of his liking!--don't stay?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Loveday turned, {{observed}} that Anne was gone, and said, 'What <b>is</b> it?' <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not know.|$|R
60|$|He {{will not}} be called to; he {{will not be}} stirred. Sometimes the intent ear of Isabel in the next room, overhears the {{alternate}} silence, and then the long lonely scratch of his pen. It <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> heard the busy claw of some midnight mole in the ground. Sometimes, she hears a low cough, and sometimes the scrape of his crook-handled cane.|$|R
60|$|She was wriggling {{her body}} in distress. It <b>was</b> quite <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> trying {{to remain on the}} nursery floor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, {{what does}} she mean by that?' he thought. The word was to him extravagant and dangerous--it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had said: [...] "How jolly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{time the}} {{character}} of his fascinated gaze did not change. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had said nothing. Then he whispered, admiringly, [...] "You understand everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her head {{lifted in}} defiance, an adorable gesture. [...] "You know my secret now." [...] It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> said, [...] "Come, {{let us have}} it over." ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{declared}} that [...] "the domicile of {{a married woman}} shall <b>be</b> determined <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> unmarried, and, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a minor, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had attained her majority", with one year's residence in the province where the divorce order was sought, and provided that foreign divorces would <b>be</b> recognized <b>as</b> long as the foreign jurisdiction had similar rules {{with respect to the}} wife's domicile.|$|R
6000|$|... "What say?" [...] Their smiling {{waitress}} {{came forward}} from the wall where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> leaning, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> thought they had spoken to her.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} {{suddenly}} upon the divan; it <b>was</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> collapsed bereft of strength; and as suddenly she fell to weeping softly.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> faced a {{darkness}} in which {{was something very}} beautiful and wonderful as yet unimagined. The little pucker in her brows became more perceptible.|$|E
60|$|During {{this brief}} {{conversation}} the princess's outcries had neither ceased nor diminished in volume, and when Plums had thus unwillingly departed, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> redoubled her efforts.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were {{ashamed of}} her late display of emotion. She spoke abruptly, and her pale eyes were expressionless. Betty thanked her and turned to go.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, no," [...] {{said the}} Countess. [...] "I never take wine." [...] Her tone <b>was</b> inconclusive, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{intended}} {{to take something}} else.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Burton sprang {{forward and}} caught the girl, who <b>was</b> reeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> going to fall. [...] "Katy! Katy! Bring some water here, quick!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked for}} a moment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> really failing him. [...] "Then you won't meet them?" [...] It <b>was</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had {{developed}} an unexpected personal prudence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Into a convent!" [...] Newman {{repeated}} the words with the deepest dismay; it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had said she}} was going into an hospital. [...] "Into a convent--YOU!" ...|$|E
60|$|Larry got no further, for at {{that moment}} came another crash on deck. The Pocastra shivered and heaved, and to those below it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would surely sink.|$|E
60|$|He {{brought her}} {{a strong sense}} of the outer world. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were set on a hill and could feel vaguely the whole world lying spread before her.|$|E
60|$|Sarah Walker at once stopped crying. I don't {{know how}} she did it, but the {{cessation}} <b>was</b> instantaneous, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had turned off a tap somewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, Sir Adrian, I {{understood}} {{that there was}} a young lady, Miss Aurelia, that Master Merrifield <b>was</b> lamenting, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had met with a watery grave." ...|$|R
60|$|But how {{impossible}} it is {{to convey}} the personal charm of a human being. I catalogue these things and it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> moved about silently behind my stumbling enumeration and smiled at me still, with her eyes a little darkened, mocking me. That phantom will never be gone from my mind. It was {{all of these things}} and none of these things that made me hers, as I have never been any other person's....|$|R
