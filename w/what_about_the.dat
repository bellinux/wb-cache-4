In March, in briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the Japanese Imperial Army was planning extensive air attacks, {{including the use of}} kamikaze. The emperor then reportedly asked, [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Navy? What are they doing to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?" [...] Now feeling pressured by the emperor to also mount some kind of attack, Japan's Navy commanders conceived a kamikaze-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship Yamato.|$|E

Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'.

500|$|Sanford wrote several books, including: But <b>What</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> People?, {{where he}} {{describes}} his efforts during the 1960s {{to establish a system}} of quality public education in North Carolina; Storm Over the States, where he lays forth a new groundwork for state government and the federal system by recommending a [...] "creative federalism"; and Outlive Your Enemies: Grow Old Gracefully, where he describes actions that will slow the aging process and rules for prolonging healthy life. He also taught classes in law and political science at Duke University and campaigned {{for the construction of a}} major performing arts center in the Research Triangle area that would provide a permanent home for the American Dance Festival, the North Carolina Symphony and the Carolina Ballet. Sanford practiced law again in his later years and merged his own firm with that of another former governor, James Holshouser. Holshouser continued to practice with Sanford Holshouser LLP until his death (the firm continues under that name), and their economic development consulting firm continued under that name.|$|E
500|$|Leyland {{was noted}} as a humorist in his playing days; many stories are {{associated}} with him, although some are probably apocryphal. He told stories against himself. One story concerned his dismissal during a wartime match, {{in which he was}} out to a terrible delivery from a bowler who was badly out of practice. Leyland hit the ball in the air and was caught. He ruefully commented: [...] "You know, I don't get much practice against that stuff". Another time, he described how he faced an over from O'Reilly, as related in his obituary in The Cricketer: [...] "'First he bowled me an off-break, then he bowled me a leg-break; then his googly, then a bumper, then one that went with his arm...' 'But that's only five, Maurice. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> last one?' 'Oh, that,' said Maurice deprecatingly. 'That was a straight 'un and it bowled me. Among his team-mates, Leyland was known as [...] "Tonnip", or [...] "Turnip", possibly a reference to his country upbringing. Robertson-Glasgow and Cardus wrote prolifically on Leyland; Gibson suggests that these pieces are among their best work. Leyland was popular with team-mates, opponents and spectators around the world. Swanton concluded his obituary of Leyland: [...] "No more courageous or determined cricketer ever buckled on pads for England." ...|$|E

500|$|Citroën was {{confident}} the C4 would be successful yet concerned {{as to whether}} it would beat the , which had won the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers title in 2006 for the BP-Ford World Rally Team. The Focus, in addition had undergone its own developments during the winter break. The tarmac testing of the C4 showed it to be faster than the outgoing Xsara, but Loeb knew that that performance might not show itself in the race. [...] "The car has been good in testing. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rally?" [...] he asked. [...] "I don't know." [...] Marcus Grönholm, the Ford team's number 1 driver, was wary, however. [...] "It's got thousands of k's on the clock. It was running when the Focus WRC 06 was still on the board." [...] Meanwhile, the Subaru World Rally Team were waiting for the [...] to be ready for the 2007 Rally Mexico in March.

500|$|Jacob Acaye, {{the former}} child soldier {{featured}} in the film, supported the video and defended its makers. In response to Ugandans saying that the film was out-of-date, Jacob stated that, [...] "It is not too late, because all this fighting and suffering {{is still going on}} elsewhere. Until now, the war that was going on has been a silent war. People did not really know about it. Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> people who are suffering over there? They are going through what we were going through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-nine crews {{registered}} {{to compete in}} the rally, Of the top-tier drivers entered, Jean-Marie Cuoq was the only WRC rookie, and Chris Atkinson, Henning Solberg, and Matthew Wilson had driven at Monte Carlo only once before, all in 2006. The starting order for Leg 1 was [...] "Priority 1" [...] (P1) and P2 WRC drivers in the order of the final classification of the 2006 season, followed by all other drivers as decided by the ACM. Loeb, the previous season's champion, set off first, followed by Grönholm, then Mikko Hirvonen. Loeb and Grönholm were the favourites to win; Loeb had won the Monte Carlo three times in a row between 2003 and 2005, and Grönholm had won in 2006. Nevertheless, there were worries that Loeb would not be physically fit enough to win. Four months earlier he had broken his left shoulder in a mountain-biking accident, and there was a chance he might not even compete {{in the first part of}} the season. His physiotherapists and consultants told him that because of the operations he had had on his arm, he should definitely have sat out the Monte Carlo Rally. Loeb admitted that he was [...] "really stressed" [...] before the start, and wondered whether his arm would be okay. [...] "It has been okay in testing but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> long stages?" [...] he asked. His answer: [...] "I don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|The debt {{taken on}} by the Glazers to finance the {{takeover}} was split between the club and the family; between £265million and £275million was secured against Manchester United's assets, putting the club into debt {{for the first time}} since James Gibson saved them in 1931. This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders want to invest in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market." [...] The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded, [...] "'The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge... The interest payment is one thing but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> actual £660million? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices, which, as we always suspected, means the fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club." [...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the good things about the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that Not One Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E
