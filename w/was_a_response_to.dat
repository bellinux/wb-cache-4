5|$|Dejection <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys {{feelings}} of dejection, expressed through {{an inability to}} write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Janáček always deeply admired Antonín Dvořák, {{to whom he}} {{dedicated}} some of his works. He rearranged part of Dvořák's Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment. In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Janáček became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers. His opera Destiny <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> another significant and famous work in contemporary Bohemia – Louise, by the French composer Gustave Charpentier. The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Janáček's later works, for example in his opera Káťa Kabanová. Although he carefully observed developments in European music, his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 2016, {{a prison}} officer (Adrian Ismay) {{had a heart}} attack and died in a hospital. He had {{received}} serious wounds following a booby-trap bomb detonating under his van on Hillsborough Drive, East Belfast 11 days earlier. The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him. The 'New' IRA claimed responsibility and said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the alleged mistreatment of republican prisoners at Maghaberry Prison. It added that the officer was targeted because he trained prison officers at Maghaberry.|$|E

5|$|The History of Sir Charles Grandison, {{commonly}} called Sir Charles Grandison, is an epistolary novel by English writer Samuel Richardson {{first published in}} February 1753. The book <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> Henry Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, which parodied the morals presented in Richardson's previous novels. The novel follows the story of Harriet Byron who is pursued by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. After she rejects Pollexfen, he kidnaps her, and she is only freed when Sir Charles Grandison comes to her rescue. After his appearance, the novel focuses on his history and life, and he becomes its central figure.|$|E
5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> Greek {{involvement in}} the Ionian Revolt, when the Eretrians and Athenians had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia {{in their attempt to}} overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king Darius I swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of Israel. In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} 1972. The Fatah subgroup Black September hijacked Sabena Flight 572 {{en route to}} Vienna and forced it to land at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel. The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E
5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the {{criticism}} that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, {{was surprised by the}} way he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players the impressions he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome, considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, {{shortly after}} the {{launching}} of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began against both the Germans and the Aćimović authorities. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed {{a meeting of the}} Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved to shift from sabotage operations to a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed. At {{the end of the first}} week in July, List requested that the Luftwaffe transfer an aircraft training school to the territory, as operational units were not available. Soon after, gendarmerie stations and patrols were being attacked, and German vehicles were fired upon. Armed groups first appeared in the Aranđelovac district, northwest of Topola.|$|E

5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the physical presence of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Hemming was {{the author}} of the second and later part, a {{collection}} of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop Ealdred of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the Enucleatio libelli, where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work. Another section, known as the Prefatio istius libelli, now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the Codicellus, is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection. Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work, but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, Samson. Historian Nicholas Brooks, along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop. The historian Julia Barrow believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the Domesday Book in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the Liber.|$|E
