5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is fairly}} narrow-bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The skin folds {{along the sides}} of the head lack distinct lobes. The eyes are oval and widely spaced; closely behind are crescent-shaped spiracles with large, boxy projections inside their anterior rims. Each nostril is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels; the outer barbel is thin, while the inner barbel has a spoon-like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base. The <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners. There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws, separated by a gap in the middle; the teeth are small, narrow, and pointed. There are five pairs of gill slits located {{on the sides of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|In the Amami Islands, {{in which}} the kiln sites are located, the {{emergence}} of kamuiyaki led to the disappearance of native Kaneku-type earthenwares {{in the first half}} of the 11th century. Only a small number of earthenwares continued to be produced and they imitated soapstone cauldrons. The common vessel forms of kamuiyaki include urns (kame), small mouthed, short necked jars (tsubo), <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> jars (hachi), grating bowls (suribachi) and bowls (wan).|$|E
25|$|In most species, a <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> extends {{all around}} the {{anterior}} circumference of the head, and bands of inwardly inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth. The anglerfish is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to {{twice as large as}} its entire body.|$|E
25|$|Gorshin's slender {{athletic}} build, <b>wide</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{and pale}} eyes under strong brows were ideal characteristics for screen henchmen. In 1957, {{he fell asleep}} at the wheel of his car after driving from Pittsburgh for thirty-nine hours without sleep and subsequently, the vehicle crashed. He {{was on his way to}} a Hollywood screen test for the role of Petty Officer Ruby in Run Silent, Run Deep.

25|$|Approximately 6,000 years ago, Tampa Bay {{formed as}} a {{brackish}} drowned river valley type estuary with a <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> connecting it to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to that time, {{it was a large}} fresh water lake, possibly fed by the Floridan Aquifer through natural springs. Though the exact process of the lake-to-bay transformation is not completely understood, the leading theory is that rising seas levels following the last ice age coupled with the formation of a massive sink hole near the current mouth of the bay created a connection between the lake and the gulf.|$|E
25|$|Kamuiyaki {{found in}} the Okinawa Islands are {{characterized}} by their association with white glazed wares, soapstone cauldrons and locally produced earthenwares. These earthenwares, collectively called gusuku wares, were urns, small mouthed jars, <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> jars, bowls and dishes. They {{were considered to be}} imitations of exotic goods including Amami's kamuiyaki. According to archaeologist Takanashi Osamu, insufficient supply of exotic goods accounts for the production of gusuku wares. Okinawan archaeologists generally argue that gusuku wares replaced earlier flat bottomed pottery. Ikeda Yoshifumi raised doubts and suspected that flat bottomed pottery and gusuku wares had co-existed in the 11th to 12th centuries. In his hypothesis, gusuku wares represented an external power that took time to assimilate indigenous societies that produced flat bottomed pottery.|$|E
25|$|T. longicaudatus is {{the most}} {{widespread}} notostracan species, and {{may be found in}} western North America, South America, Japan, South Korea, and several Pacific Islands. It is most active at a temperature of approximately , and is usually found scratching the mud at the bottom of pools, searching for benthic food. Triops collect food particles by straining the water with hairs on their limbs. Loose food particles are collected in a groove running down the underside of the body lengthwise, and held together by a sticky secretion until they are swallowed by their very small (2mm <b>wide)</b> <b>mouth.</b> The tiny mouth is deep in its underbelly, and while the animal is capable of breaking up plant roots or dead fish, it is incapable of chasing down and eating prey larger than it is.|$|E

500|$|Cosima and Blandine {{remained}} with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer George Marek describes Anna as [...] "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... {{for the first}} time [...] experienced what it was to be touched by love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her long nose and <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> was described as an [...] "ugly duckling". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lyc√©e Bonaparte.|$|E

500|$|The {{inner parts}} of the fjord receive some of the lowest {{precipitation}} of the archipelago. Combined with the exposed basic earth, this results in Europe's only High Arctic steppe. The only other area with this landscape is {{the north of the}} Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The rock bed {{on each side of the}} fjord is different. On the west side there are Devonian deposits, while there is bedrock on the east side, resulting in different vegetation on each side. The fjord has a unique shape; it has a <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> (thus the name), but at Elvetangen there is a shallow section which is [...] deep. This reduces the circulation in the inner {{parts of the}} fjord, which have a cold-water basin [...] deep.|$|E
500|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} reaches [...] {{long and}} has a thin, deep, and firm body.

Its biodiversity is derived in part from the fertile lands and fresh waters of the delta, attracting numerous species to the area, including several migratory birds. The nearby mountains of the peninsula cause a marked temperature difference between the northern and southern faces of the peninsula, producing a corollary variance in the types of species found in the delta region. The area features a trail for visitors and options for canoeing and picnicking.|$|E
500|$|York Island was {{occupied}} principally {{on the southern}} tip (what would now be considered Lower Manhattan) by New York City, on the western tip by Greenwich village, and in the north by the village of Harlem. The sparsely-populated center of the island featured a few low hills, principally Indianburg and Crown Heights. Ferry services connected the island to the surrounding lands, with the primary ferry to the mainland of Westchester County (now the Bronx) crossing the Harlem River at King's Bridge near {{the northern tip of}} the island. The island was bordered by two rivers, on the west by the Hudson River and on the east by the East River, which separated the island from Long Island. [...] Kip's Bay was a cove on the eastern shore of the island, extending roughly from present-day 32nd to 38th Streets, and as far west as Second Avenue. [...] The bay no longer exists as such, having been filled in, but in 1776, it provided an excellent place for an amphibious landing: deep water close to the shore, and a large meadow for mustering landed troops. Opposite the bay on Long Island, the <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> of Newtown Creek, also surrounded by meadowlands, offered an equally excellent staging area.|$|E
500|$|The {{common toad}} can reach about [...] in length. Females are {{normally}} stouter than males and southern specimens {{tend to be}} larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a <b>wide</b> <b>mouth</b> below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, bufotoxin, {{which is used to}} deter potential predators. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops nuptial pads on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic with the females being browner and the males greyer. The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.|$|E
