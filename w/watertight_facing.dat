2500|$|Earth-fill dams, {{also called}} earthen dams, rolled-earth dams or simply earth dams, are {{constructed}} {{as a simple}} embankment of well compacted earth. A [...] rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water. A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight clay core. Modern zoned-earth embankments employ filter and drain zones to collect and remove seep water and preserve {{the integrity of the}} downstream shell zone. An outdated method of zoned earth dam construction utilized a hydraulic fill to produce a watertight core. Rolled-earth dams may also employ a <b>watertight</b> <b>facing</b> or core {{in the manner of a}} rock-fill dam. An interesting type of temporary earth dam occasionally used in high latitudes is the frozen-core dam, in which a coolant is circulated through pipes inside the dam to maintain a watertight region of permafrost within it.|$|E
40|$|Solar cells perform two functions: {{waterproofing}} {{roof and}} generating electricity. Sections through horizontal and slanting joints show overlapping modules sealed by L-section rubber strips and side-by-side modules sealed by P-section strips. Water seeping through seals of slanting joints drains along channels. Rooftop photovoltaic array used <b>watertight</b> south <b>facing</b> roof, replacing shingles, tar, and gravel. Concept reduces cost of residential solar-cell array...|$|R
5000|$|Beyond the compass, Zhu's book {{described}} {{many other}} maritime subjects. Zhu Yu's book described {{the use of}} the for-and-aft lug, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward. Zhu also described bulkhead builds in the hulls of Chinese ships for creating watertight compartments. Therefore, if a ship's hull was heavily damaged, only one compartment would fill with water while the ship could be salvaged without sinking. Zhu Yu wrote that ships springing a leak could hardly be repaired from the inside, though; instead the Chinese employed expert foreign divers (people from the [...] "Kunlun Mountains" [...] region) that would dive into the water with chisels and oakum and mend the damage from the outside. Expert divers were written of by many Chinese authors, including Song Yingxing (1587-1666) who wrote about pearl divers that used <b>watertight</b> leather <b>face</b> masks attached with breathing tubes secured with tin rings that led up to the surface, allowing them to breathe underwater for long periods of time. Since at least the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the Chinese also had a formula for a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes that proved useful for divers.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} {{numerous}} naval battles beforehand, China's first permanent standing navy was established in 1132 during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). Gunpowder warfare at sea was also first known in China, with battles such as the Battle of Caishi and the Battle of Tangdao on the Yangtze River in 1161 AD during the Jin-Song wars. One {{of the most important}} books of medieval maritime literature was Zhu Yu's Pingzhou Table Talks of 1119 AD. Although the Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031-1095) was the first to describe the magnetic-needle compass, Zhu Yu's book was the first to specify its use for navigation at sea. Zhu Yu's book also described watertight bulkhead compartments in the hull of Chinese ships, which prevented sinking when heavily damaged in one compartment. Although the drydock was known, Zhu Yu wrote of expert divers who were often used to repair boats that were damaged and still submersed in water. Divers in China continued to have a maritime significance, as the later Ming Dynasty author Song Yingxing (1587-1666) wrote about pearl divers who used snorkeling gear (a <b>watertight</b> leather <b>face</b> mask and breathing tube secured with tin rings) to breathe underwater while tied by the waist to the ship in order to be secure while hunting for pearls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subject of}} {{maritime}} and nautical {{technology and engineering}} was discussed extensively by Song Yingxing. Song noted that in northern China the chief means of transportation was by carriage and cart, while in southern China it was by ship and boat. [...] He provided various nuances about nautical matters, such as metal anchors for battleships and seagoing vessels weighing up to 30,000 catties. [...] Song noted that {{there were thousands of}} names classifying different boats found in China, which was often named in accordance to their overall shape, cargo capacity, and quality (of material used and construction). [...] For example, he described the layout and construction of the grain tribute boat as a shallow, flat-bottom craft, with the preferred woods of cedar and chestnut being used to construct the bulkhead compartments of the hull. Song also wrote of the methods used by the Chinese in his day for pearl diving in Guangdong. Song wrote that these divers were able to stay underwater for prolonged periods of time since a secure rope was tied around their waists connected to the ship as they breathed through a long curving pipe that led up above the surface of the water. This long breathing tube was strengthened by rings of tin and fastened to a <b>watertight</b> leather <b>face</b> mask. A drawn illustration of this was provided in his book.|$|R
