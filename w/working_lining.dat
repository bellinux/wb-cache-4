40|$|High {{accuracy}} in <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> wear rate measurements of a metallurgical vessel is very essential. If the molten steel burns through the vessel because of excessive lining wear, the consequences may be substantial losses in production, {{damage to the}} instrumentation, and equipment and danger to the staff. Such lining measurements are done with laser scanning equipment. The positioning of the vessel for the laser scanning is done with a CCD-camera. Each vessel contains a positioning plate, which is a planar object containing four rings at the corners. A procedure realised with a special image processing hardware locates the rings on a rectangular plane with known dimensions. With that information {{the position of the}} metallurgical vessel is calculated before each laser scanning. The ring search method is based on cross-correlation, which is a very accurate method in 2 D situations. There is, however, a problem of the perspective projection of the ring at different angles, which causes a [...] ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the second}} {{illustration}} shows, a low pressure ratio fan (such as that {{used on a}} high bypass ratio turbofan) has a range of <b>working</b> <b>lines.</b> At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke. Above the choking condition, the <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> tend to coalesce into a unique steep straight line. When the nozzle unchokes, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> starts to become more curved, reflecting the curvature of the nozzle characteristic. With falling flight Mach number, the cold nozzle pressure ratio decreases. Initially this has no effect upon {{the position of the}} <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> apart from the curved (unchoked) tail, which becomes longer. Eventually, the cold nozzle will become unchoked at lower flight Mach numbers, even at full throttle. The <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> will now become curved, gradually migrating towards surge as flight Mach number decreases. The lowest surge margin <b>working</b> <b>line</b> occurs at static conditions.|$|R
50|$|Because a {{high-pressure}} compressor 'sees' the {{choked flow}} {{capacity of the}} high-pressure turbine, the compressor <b>working</b> <b>line</b> is hardly affected by flight conditions. The slope of the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> approximates to a constant corrected outlet flow.|$|R
50|$|Being a high {{pressure}} ratio device, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> is relatively shallow. If the unit had no variable geometry, {{there would be}} handling problems, because the surge line would be very steep and cross the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> at part-flow.|$|R
40|$|Magnesia-chromite bricks are {{commonly}} used in the <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> in vacuum-oxygen decarburisation ladles. However, they are expensive and potentially environmentally-unfriendly. The possibilities of employing magnesia-carbon refractories were investigated through industrial testing combined with post-mortem assessments, thermodynamic calculations and mechanical considerations. Pitch bonded magnesia materials cannot {{be used in the}} slagline owing to the MgO-C reaction and extrinsic oxidation of carbon by reducible slag components (mainly CrOx), resulting in carbon removal, slag infiltration and direct MgO corrosion. Combined with turbulent slag motion this leads to hot erosion. Direct carbon burnout and the MgO reaction are the main causes for their failure in the freeboard. However, pitch bonded magnesia refractories are able to compete with magnesia-chromite bricks in the ladle bottom and in the lower metal bath region, where levels of turbulence and slag infiltration are limited. Simultaneously, both the MgO-C reaction and the extrinsic oxidation of carbon are restrained by, respectively, the inhibiting effect of a mechanical barrier and the non-wetting behaviour of steel towards the magnesia refractory component. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. February 2014. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Eshan V. Dave. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 95 pages. Northern Minnesota's iron mines are {{the starting point}} {{for the majority of the}} steel that gets produced in the United States. Their taconite processing plants use heat in furnaces to oxidize and indurate iron in the final stage of making a taconite pellet. Facilities can increase efficiencies when refractory service life is maintained. Efficiencies gained include: less fuel used, better quality control, better furnace control, and less mechanical component maintenance. Furnace refractory linings fail when the cracks that develop in them are uncontrolled or too large. These failures allow heat and gases retained by the lining to reach structural or mechanical components. Furnace control and efficiencies are also compromised when heat and gases are allowed to short circuit or escape the system. These failures are primarily the result of thermal of shock and expansion. It is common place to add stainless steel needle reinforcement to a monolithic refractory in an effort to counteract these effects. This study used several standard ASTM testing procedures to test 65 % alumina mullite based refractory samples with 304 and 406 grade stainless steel needles. Mechanical property data gathered was used to analyze performance. The study found that adding reinforcement does not increase initial Compression and Cold Modulus of Ruptures strengths, however, after prolonged heat and thermal shock exposure, needles help maintain integrity and mechanical properties of samples. The study also found that corrosion due to oxidation was a major contributing factor to the way needles performed; and concluded that a concentration of 3 % 406 "Alfa 1 " stainless steel reinforcing needles added to the <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> of a taconite furnace is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnesia}} carbon (MgO-C) refractory is {{a classical}} {{choice for the}} <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> of steel making furnaces because of slag corrosion and thermal shock resistance. However, the poor oxidation resistance of carbon beyond 900 oC eventually damage the brick, and subsequent necessities of reinstallation enhance the cost of steel. Hence, minimization of carbon content without compromising of existence properties of MgO-C brick {{is one of the}} prime research areas. The present investigation aims to replace a part of the carbon (mostly graphite flakes) with graphite-SiC microcomposite (C/SiC). The latter non-oxide SiC is known to have excellent high temperature strength, better oxidation resistance, high abrasion resistance and moderate thermal conductivity. The basic objective of this dissertation is to carry out systematic laboratory and pilot industrial scale preparation of composites and understand the effect of microcomposites on MgO-C refractory properties. The micro-composite has been synthesised by a simple carbothermal reduction of microfine silica (SiO 2) in presence of graphite flakes in the temperature range of 1600 - 1650 oC under a reducing atmosphere created by packing the reactants within petroleum coke in raising hearth furnace (RHF) / tunnel kiln (TK) or either controlled atmospheric furnace (CAF). It has been observed that two different morphologies of the SiC phase namely fibre/rod and ribbon developed based on the specific condition of synthesis. A different grade of MgO-C bricks has been prepared through the addition of a different percentage of synthesized graphite-SiC composites at an optimum processing condition and evaluated their physical, thermo-mechanical, oxidation and slag corrosion behaviour. An optimum content of SiC present in the synthesized graphite – SiC microcomposite exhibits better oxidation resistance, hot modulus of rupture and slag corrosion properties compared to the only graphite content brick or addition of equivalent amount of free commercial grade - SiC containing MgO-C brick...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{a study on}} the thermal state of {{steelmaking}} ladles was undertaken. The transient hot wire method was verified for thermal conductivity measurements on metallurgical slags and applied to ladle slag measurements. Temperature measurements on ladles in an industrial environment were carried out. The emissivities of the outer and inner shells of steelmaking ladles were investigated. Two dynamic models were developed to predict the heat transfer and fluid flow in a preheating and teeming ladle. The gathered thermal conductivity values for ladle slag were used to study the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt on heat transfer and fluid flow in a teeming ladle. In the first stage, the transient hot-wire method was verified to measure the thermal conductivity of metallurgical slags at steelmaking temperatures. A numerical model was developed, cold model experiments were conducted and test measurements using a high temperature experimental setup were carried out. To minimize natural convection and to obtain more reliable measurements, the crucible diameter, the hot-wire diameter, the applied current, the position of the wire in the crucible and the cooling on the upper surface of the crucible were studied. Investigations into the choice of sheathing material of the circuit exposed to the slag were also made. It was found that only certain materials were suitable for slag measurements depending on slag composition and temperature. The electrical resistivity of the hot wire was measured to make the thermal conductivity calculation more reliable. The wire diameter also played a major role due to the heat generation per surface area. The thermal conductivity should be derived from the values measured during the first seconds. In this initial stage, the effect of the natural convection {{as a function of the}} wire position in the crucible, the cooling on the top surface and the diameter of the crucible are negligible. A compromise has to be made in choosing the electrical current, since higher current results in higher sensitivity but at the same time in more natural convection. In the second stage, the thermal conductivities of four different ladle slags were measured at 1773 K, 1823 K, 1873 K and 1923 K using the transient hot wire method. Very good reproducibility was obtained. The thermal conductivity did not vary substantially with the variation of slag composition at 1873 K and 1923 K, at which the slag samples were all entirely liquid. The thermal conductivities were low. It was found that the precipitation of solid phase resulted in a considerable increase of thermal conductivity. In the third stage, a two dimensional model was developed in order to predict the temperature distribution in the ladle wall during the preheating process. The model calculated the heat transfer and the velocity field in the gas phase inside the ladle as well as the heat transfer in the solid walls during the preheating process. Measurements of the temperature profiles in an industrial ladle were carried out using an infrared thermography. The measurements were made both inside and outside the ladle. The model predictions were found to be in reasonably good agreement with the measured temperatures. It was found that the preheating time could be minimized when the <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> became thinner. The effect ofthe distance between the lid and the ladle was also studied by the model. The results indicated that there was no significant temperature change on the upper side wall of the ladle. On the lower side wall and bottom the temperature changed slightly. The temperature difference in the lower part of the ladle could be explained by the larger flame distance from the bottom layer. In the fourth stage, a two dimensional axisymmetric model was developed to predict the heat flux in a steelmaking ladle during the teeming process. The model predicts dynamically the flow fields in both the liquid phase and the gas phase along with the movement of the liquid upper surface. The model also predicts the temperature distributions in the liquid metal, gas phase and all layers in the ladle wall. Again, industrial measurements were performed using an infrared thermography, both inside the ladle after teeming and at the wall outside the ladle during the whole process sequence. The model predictions were found to be in agreement with the measured data. It was found that the heat transfer to the surrounding atmosphere and the conductivity of the highly insulating layer were the most important factors for the heat loss. The decrease of the thickness of the <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> was found to have limited effect on the total heat flux. In the fifth and final stage, the effect of the slag layer on the top surface of the melt, on fluid flow and on heat transfer in a teeming ladle was investigated theoretically. The two dimensional axisymmetric model developed in the fourth stage was used. To predict the effect of the slag layer a stationary heat conduction boundary condition including thermal conductivity and slag layer thickness was employed. Different calculations with differing thermal conductivity values for the slag layer were carried out. The calculations showed that the effect of the slag layer was insignificant. This could be explained by the similarity of the thermal conductivity of slag and gas phase. QC 20121010 </p...|$|E

Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{industrial}} gas turbine systems are designed to operate with conventional fossil fuels. Recently, the use of Low Calorific Value (LCV) fuels gained interest, particularly, Hydrogen rich Syngas resulting from coal and solid waste gasification. When LCV fuels are used the performance and behavior of the engines could significantly change and modifications may be needed. For instance, due to the relatively low heating value the {{fuel mass flow rate}} will be much higher than natural gas, increasing substantially the mass flow through the turbine. This leads to a decrease of demand for air from the compressor, which results in increased back pressure, reduction of stall margin and possible compressor instability. This paper presents a preliminary study to pave the way to the design of a 300 MW industrial gas turbine?s compressor with the objective of operating efficiently with Hydrogen rich syngas, while maintaining the flexibility for a quick switch to natural gas in the event of gasifier failure or breakdown of feedstock supply. NASA Rotor 37 is used as the test vehicle to provide design concepts because of its simplicity in being a single stage compressor and the availability of experimental data for the CFD model validation. Geometric modifications were performed on the rotor to shift the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> towards an estimated lower air mass flow rate <b>working</b> <b>line.</b> Further modifications were investigated {{in order to maintain the}} design point compressor efficiency primarily based on sweep and lean of the blade.
