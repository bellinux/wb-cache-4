Shane told his father that ECW needed {{to be taken care}} of and pointed out that there were ten ECW wrestlers under Heyman's belt. He {{suggested}} that WWF and WCW field five wrestlers each to take out ECW; Vince agreed, but he stubbornly insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|After all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> Our Lady Peace had {{recorded}} 45 songs at ten different studios, twelve {{of which they}} finally felt satisfied with. The album was mixed by Randy Staub at the studios in Maui {{as well as at}} The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, B.C.. Mastering was done by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City. The album's final release date was assured to be August 30, 2005, {{two and a half years}} after recording began.|$|E
25|$|With the NHL {{preparing}} for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, leave for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced {{the cancellation of}} the 2004–05 NHL season. The Flyers {{were one of the}} more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms. When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two-thirds of the roster.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} day of the regular season, the AL East was still up for grabs with both the Rays and New York Yankees tied for first place. For the Rays to clinch the division, they needed either a win, or a loss by the Yankees. When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> both happened, as the Yankees lost to the Boston Red Sox prior to the Rays {{defeating}} the Kansas City Royals in extra innings. In September and October combined, the Rays split 30 games, going 15–15. They finished the regular season 96–66, winning the division by a single game, and finishing one win shy of their franchise record set in 2008. The Rays also had home field advantage through the American League side of the postseason.|$|E
500|$|The Atlus {{version was}} {{directed}} by Kouji Okada, while the scenario's original elements were written by Kazunari Suzuki. Sprite and promotional artwork was designed by Esaki Minoru, and the music was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. During the early phases, the gameplay concept was a near-copy of the gameplay style of the Wizardry series, attributed by Suzuki to their superiors being fans of the series. Suzuki insisted on the inclusion of some new feature which would distinguish it from Wizardry. This resulted {{in the creation of}} the demon negotiation system. Okada later stated that demon negotiation was decided upon from an early stage. Speaking later about the first-person exploration, Okada was highly critical, feeling that after all their efforts [...] "All we had left after everything <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> were lots and lots of long, winding dungeons!". Storage space on the cartridge was a recurring concern for the team, with Suzuki using unspecified programming tricks to include high-quality sprite graphics. Due to the rules of the gaming industry at the time, the teams and studios either went uncredited or had pseudonyms, with Masuko being credited as [...] "Project Satan".|$|E
500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> {{it was another}} tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but that this one ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} blamed Star Wars, {{as well as}} Jaws, for ruining Hollywood by {{shifting}} its focus from [...] "sophisticated" [...] films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy. One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, [...] "When all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass." [...] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg [...] "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged {{it back into the}} grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was [...] "a kind of rebirth".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{never before}} worn prostheses, Cecily Adams found the Ishka makeup [...] "rather daunting" [...] and {{described}} the three to four hour application process {{before moving on to}} costuming. [...] Originally the producers drew lines on Adams' hands to make them appear older, but later decided they didn't look old enough and added fake hands. [...] Once all <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> only the palms of Adams' hands and her upper lip were visible. [...] After begging and pleading with the DS9 staff to see the dailies, Adams realized how much she needed to overexpress to have her facial expressions translate through the makeup. [...] When she came back to DS9 for 's [...] "The Magnificent Ferengi", Adams agreed on the condition she receive her own custom faceplate. [...] Adams praised the other DS9 actors who suffered through similar makeup ordeals saying, [...] "I think it's astonishing that they were all in good cheer, and to be in the makeup all the time is really something." [...] Because Ishka is flouting Ferengi law by wearing clothes, it was decided that she would overdo it, and so Adams was encumbered with [...] "baubles and bangles and beads" [...] that made so much noise on set that Adams estimated she had to loop half her lines. [...] For [...] "Profit and Lace", where Ishka was to leave the Ferengi homeworld of Ferenginar for the first time, Adams was dressed in a [...] "Spandex suit from [...] wrists to the tip of [...] toes". [...] Further, because Ishka was old, the staff padded Adams' costume with , including fake breasts that Adams guessed weighed after watching the dailies, both Adams and Behr agreed that the breasts needed to be reduced as they were too distracting. [...] Adams would later thank both director René Auberjonois and co-star Armin Shimerman for helping her realize that overacting {{was the name of the}} game when working under such protheses.|$|E
