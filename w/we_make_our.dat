500|$|Chris Robinson {{granted that}} the {{experience}} of playing Led Zeppelin songs with Jimmy Page influenced Lions, but not on a song-by-song basis. [...] "Led Zeppelin's music is very dramatic and very dynamic. [...] That's something we've attempted to do with our style also. I think it definitely affected how <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> music." [...] Funk and R were bigger influences than on past albums, and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] was influenced by Nick Drake.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 The Independent {{noted that}} [...] "Tolle's {{theories}} are certainly {{seen by many}} as profoundly non-Christian, even though Tolle often quotes from the Bible," [...] but that [...] "Tolle does have fans in academic, even Christian, circles". It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group is}} notable for its stances against racism (as {{evidenced}} by [...] "Colored People", the second track of Jesus Freak), {{as well as}} the uncompromising Christian message in its music. [...] "We're very open about our Christian faith," [...] says McKeehan, [...] "but when <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> records we want to create a musical experience that anyone can immerse themselves in." [...] But still, he says, [...] "one of our goals is to encourage listeners to question themselves and to seek out truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Zapatistas’ {{movement}} {{was the first}} time a guerrilla movement held women’s liberation as part of the agenda for the uprising. Major Ana Maria—who was not only the woman who lead the EZLN capture of San Cristobal de las Casas during the uprising, but also one of the women who helped create the Women’s Revolutionary Law, [...] ‘A general law was made, but there was no women’s law. And so we protested and said {{that there has to be}} a women’s law when <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>our</b> demands. We also want the government to recognize us as women. The right to have equality, equality of men and women.’ The Women’s Revolutionary Law came about through a woman named Susana and Comandanta Ramona traveling to dozens of communities and to ask the opinions of thousands of women. The Women’s Revolutionary Law was released along with the rest of the Zapatista demands aimed at the government during their public uprising on New Years Day of 1994.|$|E
2500|$|... 23. We {{are fully}} aware of the {{difficulties}} confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and <b>We</b> <b>make</b> <b>Our</b> own his words: [...] "No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values." [...] No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems {{to be the result of}} misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.|$|E
