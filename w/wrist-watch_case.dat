5000|$|Coblentz {{was raised}} in a pacifistic and insular Amish Mennonite {{community}} in Hartville, Ohio. [...] Although {{the community as a whole}} was skeptical of higher education and advanced technology, Coblentz has described his father, Alvin S. Coblentz, as a [...] "self-taught researcher, educator, and 'technologist' of sorts: a watch and clock repairman." [...] A biography of Alvin describes his design of a mechanical device that enabled the operation of an automobile accelerator and brake with a single pedal, compensating for his physical disability and allowing him to get a driverâ€™s license. Coblentz has also spoken of his father's creation, in the mid-1960s, of a functioning radio in a <b>wrist-watch</b> <b>case,</b> an invention that was never brought to market because of Alvin's lack of familiarity with the US patent process. The family of eight subsisted on the $200 per month Alvin earned from publishing a conservative Mennonite periodical, The Fellowship Messenger.|$|E
