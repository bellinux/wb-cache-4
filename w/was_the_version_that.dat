5|$|In a later {{edition of}} his memoirs, Vrba responded that he is certain the {{reference}} to the imminent Hungarian deportations was in the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, but which did not survive. He wrote that he recalled Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council, who translated the report into German, arguing that only actual deaths should be recorded, and not speculation, to lend the report maximum credibility. Vrba speculated {{that this was the}} reason Krasniansky omitted the references to Hungary from the German translation, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> was copied around the world.|$|E
500|$|Several {{days after}} the initial threats of legal action, Powderfinger backed down and {{announced}} they would change the song. The band's lawyers sent Shine {{a copy of the}} new, altered lyrics. It was then reported that an analysis of the new lyrics found they were safe to release. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> would later be used on the album. A statement from Shine's office stated that [...] "Crown Law has examined the lyrics. Crown Law have advised Mr Shine's office the lyrics raise no legal concern." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{his music}} progressed and {{popularity}} grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong {{was not the}} first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, [...] "Heebie Jeebies". At a recording session for Okeh Records, when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor and the music began before he could pick up the pages, Armstrong simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh president E.A. Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue. Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit. Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs. On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out [...] "I done forgot the words" [...] in the middle of recording [...] "I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas." ...|$|E
5000|$|Though <b>the</b> song <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1989 and 1992, the 1997 live release <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> charted.|$|R

50|$|On 2 May 2006, the {{painting}} with the floral background sold at auction at Christie's, New York, {{for more than}} $40million (USD). This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> Vincent gave to Theo.|$|E
50|$|Heidi, a 1968 {{television}} movie which starred Jennifer Edwards with Maximilian Schell and Michael Redgrave. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> became infamous {{for interrupting}} an American football game that was broadcast the same day.|$|E
5000|$|... "Mr Chad" [...] or just [...] "Chad", <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> {{became popular}} in the United Kingdom. The {{character}} of Chad may have derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating [...] "Kilroy was here".|$|E
5|$|Another <b>version</b> of <b>the</b> video {{features}} {{footage from}} past music videos and live performances. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> first aired in the USA.|$|R
50|$|Mostarda di Cremona or mostarda cremonese (from Cremona) is {{made with}} several kinds of {{different}} fruit, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> typifies mostarda di frutta.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> third <b>version,</b> written during <b>the</b> authors time at Via Fondazza 40 in Bologna, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{edited and}} {{published}} by Bompiani in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Lennon {{recorded}} the song at Record Plant East over many takes. Take four <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> was edited for release on Mind Games. The backing track for the released version {{was composed of}} four separate segments spliced together. The production uses echo to compress Lennon's vocal performance.|$|E
50|$|The 1873 version <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> Bruckner sent to Wagner for his approval. It is {{available}} in an edition by Leopold Nowak (published 1977), {{which is based on}} Wagner's fair copy. It was first performed by Hans-Hubert Schönzeler at the Adelaide Festival of Arts in Australia in 1978.|$|E
5000|$|... "You Bring Me Down" [...] is a 2006 single by the two-piece band, Blood Red Shoes. It {{was later}} re-recorded and re-issued by the band as their first CD release in early 2008.

5000|$|... 2.1 (04-10-1987): This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{included}} in most {{copies of the}} King's Quest Collection. It has the disk-based copy protection removed. Uses AGI2.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> second <b>version</b> of <b>the</b> game saw {{release in}} Japan, Europe, and North America. As a result, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> title <b>is</b> {{primarily}} identified with.|$|R
50|$|Time Walker was re-released {{for home}} video {{under a new}} title (and new opening and closing credits) in Spring 1991. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> aired on MST3K.|$|R
5000|$|The {{successive}} resequencings occurred {{largely because}} different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of [...] "Science" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> became {{a hit in}} America and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.|$|E
50|$|The lead vocals were {{provided}} by Wood, a rarity in the band's catalog, as most lead vocals were by Rod Stewart or less often by Ronnie Lane. Stewart and Lane recorded lead vocals for it; however, their producer suggested Wood give it a try, and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> {{was used for the}} track which appeared on the record.|$|E
5000|$|The Cotton MS. {{gives an}} [...] "Incipit prophecia Thome Arseldon" [...] and an [...] " [...] prophetia thome de Arseldoune", thus this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> Walter Scott excerpted as Appendix. The Sloan MS. begins the second fytte with: [...] "Heare begynethe þe ijd fytt I saye / of Sir thomas of Arseldon," [...] and the Thornton MS. gives the [...] " [...] Thomas Of Erseldowne" [...] after the 700th line.|$|E
50|$|Wittkower {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> for library <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now <b>the</b> existing <b>version,</b> although EA Barletta indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> for Santa Trinità dei Convalescenti may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>version.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mark 92 {{modification}} 2 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> originally fit to USN Oliver Hazard Perry-class {{guided missile}} frigates. It was also {{installed on the}} Adelaide-class derivatives built for Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Track 14 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> {{appears on}} <b>the</b> 2011 reissue of [...] "Liverpool". <b>The</b> <b>version</b> on <b>the</b> [...] "Wildlife" [...] {{cassette}} release lasts approximately 15 seconds longer than <b>the</b> original <b>version.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Capcom {{attempted}} {{to address these}} claims with Auto Modellista: US Tuned, containing the new content made for the later North American release plus various tweaks to gameplay. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> would eventually wind up as a GameCube and Xbox game, with the latter due for release in Europe on April 2004. Regardless, the claims still persisted; many distributors predicted that sales of the game {{were going to be}} poor, and generally refused to carry it.|$|E
50|$|The finale {{contains}} four improvisations, two {{each for}} orchestra alone and solo cello, and ends adagio, quietly. Piatigorsky told Walton that the violinist Jascha Heifetz had some {{reservations about the}} ending, so the composer provided an alternative ending, but ultimately his first version <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> was premiered. In 1975 Piatigorsky himself asked Walton to revise the ending. He did so, but Piatigorsky's illness (and death) prevented him from performing that version, and it remains unheard.|$|E
50|$|As was {{the case}} with Shogun, an edited, feature film-length version of the miniseries was made for {{theatrical}} release in other countries under the title The Antagonists. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> became available on home video. The complete Masada miniseries first made it to the video market on four VHS tapes in 2001. A two-disc DVD release titled Masada — The Complete Epic Mini-Series was released on September 11, 2007. A Region 2 UK, two-disc DVD was released on 19 January 2009.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> {{appeared}} on <b>the</b> original single, {{not the one}} on The Smiths. It features a fade-intro, louder bass, and vocals that sound very distant.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> remixed <b>version</b> of <b>the</b> song [...] "Sotsugyou: Sayonara wa Ashita no Tameni" [...] on <b>the</b> album <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> used as {{an insert}} song for the anime series InuYasha.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used in <b>the</b> Sharpe movies, {{written by}} John Tams. Note that each verse {{is from a}} {{different}} movie, as noted {{at the start of}} the verse.|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} this was that the {{interest}} of the JDŽ in the V 200 was awakened, and in 1956 ordered three locomotives; however, on Yugoslav railways the axle load limit was 16 t; so Krauss-Maffei designed the ML 2200 CC, a six axle version of the V 200 with correspondingly lower axle loads. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> the JDŽ procured. Additionally, a more efficient cooling system than in the V 200 was installed, as Yugoslavia has a warmer climate than Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{days after}} the initial threats of legal action, Powderfinger backed down and {{announced}} they would change the song.

50|$|This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> the MS-DOS product emerged from, since, at the time, id Software {{was using}} a NeXTcube for its graphic-engine development. This version is {{sluggish}} on anything below an 040 NeXTstation/cube (though it runs smoother with a higher amount of memory), and is missing sound, which was added on the PC side. With NeXT-Step based on i486 architecture, it ran smoothly under all conditions up to screen sizes of 400% with newer hardware. The version running on NeXT is 1.2, programmed by John Carmack, John Romero, and Dave Taylor.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} section describes the TCAS operation based on TCAS II, since this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> has <b>been</b> adopted {{as an international}} standard (ACAS II) by ICAO and aviation authorities worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Basils financiers {{released}} their {{cut of the}} film, {{complete with}} their choice of sound, design and music. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>version</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> subsequently released on cable, and then in videotape and DVD.|$|R
