In this novel Duteurtre relates some personal experiences from his activities {{as a journalist}} and music critic.

25|$|This {{can occur}} {{even if the}} subject is not {{conscious}} of the priming stimulus. An example of this was done by Bargh et al. in 1996. Subjects were implicitly primed with words related to the stereotype of elderly people (example: Florida, forgetful, wrinkle). While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth {{than those who were}} primed with neutral stimuli. Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words were more likely to interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt. A Yale study showed that something as simple as holding a hot or cold beverage before an interview could result in pleasant or negative opinion of the interviewer. However, there has been a serious lack of replication (see below).|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} ski flying {{can be traced}} {{directly}} to 15 March 1936 in Planica, Slovenia (then {{a part of the}} Kingdom of Yugoslavia), when 18-year-old Austrian Josef [...] "Sepp" [...] Bradl became the first man in history to land a ski jump of over [...] His world record jump of [...] was set at Bloudkova velikanka ("Bloudek giant"), a new hill designed and completed in 1934 by engineers Stanko Bloudek and Ivan Rožman, together with Joso Gorec. With jumps now in the triple digits, Bloudek enthused: [...] "That was no longer ski jumping. That was ski flying!" [...] It was <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> that ski flying took {{on a life of its}} own. Such was the awe and disbelief at these massive jumps, the units of measurement were trivialised by the media, who suggested that the metre used in Yugoslavia was shorter than elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

Of all their designs, the Plastic Chairs come closest to achieving this ideal. They found that the use of plastic in furniture design has several advantages: it has pleasant tactile qualities, it has malleability and static strength combined with a high-degree of flexibility, and it makes feasible, via mass-production, their goal of low-cost furniture.|$|E
2500|$|In what {{historian}} William C. Davis dubbed [...] "the three shortest yet {{perhaps most}} significant resolutions in the document," [...] the delegates agreed that Texas {{would pay for}} the army, would repay any goods purchased by its agents, and would give volunteers public lands. [...] These were powers reserved for states, and under the Constitution of 1824 Texas was not a stand-alone state. [...] <b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>words,</b> delegates violated the very constitution they had sworn to uphold. [...] Davis asserts that this provision signified that the delegates fully intended for Texas to become an independent nation, eventually.|$|E

"The real {{significance}} of Sacchini's work {{is difficult to}} determine aesthetically, although the obvious historical importance of the composer and his activity undoubtedly demands more careful study and more thorough investigation": <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> the editor of Sacchini's article in the Grande Enciclopedia della Musica Lirica begins the section evaluating his music. Any such assessment is made more difficult by the comparative lack of interest the modern operatic world has shown in Sacchini's works, although this has begun to change in the early 21st century: there are now two complete recordings of Œdipe à Colone and one of Renaud.|$|E

2500|$|Ernst vom Rath died of {{his wounds}} on 9 November. Word {{of his death}} reached Hitler that evening while he was with several {{key members of the}} Nazi party at a dinner commemorating the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. After intense discussions, Hitler left the {{assembly}} abruptly without giving his usual address. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels delivered the speech, in his place, and said that [...] "the Führer has decided that... demonstrations should not be prepared or organized by the party, but insofar as they erupt spontaneously, they are not to be hampered." [...] The chief party judge Walter Buch later stated that the message was clear; <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> Goebbels had commanded the party leaders to organize a pogrom.|$|E
2500|$|Moroni is {{associated}} with the [...] "title of liberty", a standard which he raised to rally the Nephites to defend their liberties from a group of dissenters who wanted to establish their leader as a king. Moroni was so angry with Amalickiah's dissention and wicked influence that he tore his coat and wrote upon it, [...] "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children". <b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>words,</b> he rallied his people to defend their families and their freedom and drove out the armies of Amalickiah. Moroni put to death any dissenters who did not flee and who would not support the cause of freedom, and his “title of liberty” was raised over every Nephite tower.|$|E

[...] Rabbi Simeon interpreted the words of [...] "And God give you of the dew of heaven," [...] to mean [...] "the heritage of Jacob" [...] in [...] Rabbi Simeon taught that <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words,</b> Isaac indicated that Jacob's children would rise again from the dead {{at the time to}} come, by means of heavenly dew that shall issue forth from God. Rabbi Abba responded to Rabbi Simeon that there was more significance to Isaac's blessing than he had thought.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] Hakkō ichiu did {{not enter}} general {{circulation}} until 1940, when the second Konoe administration issued a white paper titled [...] "Fundamental National Policy" [...] ( [...] Kihon Kokusaku Yōkō), which opened <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words,</b> and in which Prime Minister Konoe proclaimed that the basic aim of Japan's national policy was [...] "the establishment of world peace in conformity with the very spirit in which our nation was founded" [...] and that {{the first step was}} the proclamation of a [...] "new order in East Asia" [...] ( [...] Tōa Shin Chitsujo), which later took the form of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere". [...] In the most magnanimous form, the term was used to indicate the making of a universal brotherhood implemented by the uniquely virtuous Yamato. [...] Because this would bring people under the emperor's fatherly benevolence, force was justified against those who resisted.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Barbara B. Diefendorf, Professor of History at Boston University, {{wrote that}} Simon Vigor had [...] "said if the King ordered the Admiral (Coligny) killed, 'it would be wicked {{not to kill}} him'. <b>With</b> <b>these</b> <b>words,</b> the most popular preacher in Paris legitimised in advance the events of St. Bartholomew's Day". Diefendorf says that when {{the head of the}} murdered Coligny was shown to the Paris mob {{by a member of the}} nobility, with the claim that it was the King's will, the die was cast. Another {{historian}} Mack P. Holt, Professor at George Mason University, agrees that Vigor, [...] "the best known preacher in Paris," [...] preached sermons that were full of references to the evils that would befall the capital should the Protestants seize control. This view is also partly supported by Cunningham and Grell (2000) who explained that [...] "militant sermons by priests such as Simon Vigor served to raise the religious and eschatological temperature on the eve of the Massacre".|$|E
2500|$|A milder form {{than either}} niddui or herem was the [...] "nezifah" [...] ban. (In modern Hebrew, [...] "nezifah" [...] {{generally}} means [...] "a dressing-down" [...] or [...] "reading (someone) the riot act", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During {{this time the}} offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct {{on the day of}} nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that {{it was a matter of}} proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>words</b> the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah, vii. 13).|$|E
