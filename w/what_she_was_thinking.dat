60|$|He glanced {{quickly at}} Sally, he {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> {{and then looked}} away again.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked down}} at his companion--her eyes were lowered; he could not tell at all <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no--oh no!' exclaimed Mary, {{in great}} confusion, 'Gertrude did not mean--I am sure I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of.' ...|$|E
50|$|Emily Rose Robinson as Jayde Cooper, {{the trait}} {{positive}} {{daughter of a}} Deacon who isn't afraid to say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tetra's {{expression}} {{clearly shows}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking,</b> which the narrator appreciates because it lets him know if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> following his explanations. She uses exaggerated gestures, frequently making the narrator wish {{that she would}} calm down.|$|R
30|$|Dana: During interviews, she has {{no problem}} {{speaking}} up and sharing her opinion. She lets you know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking,</b> and I think it’s an honest opinion. It’s her opinion… and not always his [the president’s opinion].|$|R
60|$|She looked {{round the}} room, vaguely. Birkin could not guess {{what she was}} looking for, nor <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b> Evidently she noticed her sons.|$|E
60|$|Now Sewell was {{not aware}} how matters stood between her and his comrade, but he might have guessed <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> for his next remark was curiously apposite.|$|E
60|$|She {{might have}} been a Countess! she knew she might, but for this cursed barrier between her and her fortune. Wood knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of, and smiled grimly.|$|E
60|$|One {{would know}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wellborn {{to see her}} now. Poor girl, what a burden a life of {{dependence}} must be to a spirit like hers! I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of so intently. And Coventry indulged in another look before he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} plan too," [...] said Marian, laughing; [...] "but I am afraid poor Selina cannot be in such good hands. See, here are the impertinent people writing verses about her, {{as if they had}} any {{business}} to ask her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about. Listen, Gerald; did you ever hear such stuff?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Guess What Her Majesty The Queen Is Thinking: Another {{variation}} of the Big Cash Prize, Ferguson states that they have imagined a scenario where her majesty the queen has been wrongly imprisoned, and the guest must guess <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> He then proceeds to impersonate the queen and tell {{whether or not they}} were correct.|$|R
60|$|Clym {{saw little}} of Thomasin {{for several days}} after this; and when they met she was more silent than usual. At length he asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of so intently.|$|E
60|$|Laura {{glanced down}} at her hands, and Nasmyth guessed <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> for they were hard, and work-roughened. The toil that her hands showed was, as he realized, {{only a part of}} her burden.|$|E
6000|$|Chloe stood {{handling}} {{them over}} abstractedly; {{it was quite}} evident that the chickens were not <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of. At last, with the short laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal, she said, ...|$|E
25|$|Natsuki is {{a friend}} and classmate of Kanade; {{something}} that they both share in common is their shy nature. Because Natsuki barely talks at all, and is usually emotionless, {{it is difficult to}} tell <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> The most important person to her is Kanade, her only friend. In Your Diary +, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> promoted to a heroine from a sub-character.|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta said nothing; and {{the dull}} winter {{atmosphere}} had far from light enough {{in it to}} show by her face <b>what</b> <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Her next inquiry showed <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of. [...] "If Mr. Kirke was not poor, {{why did he}} come to live in that house?" ...|$|R
60|$|They laughed together, and {{she left}} the room, still looking back {{to see if there}} was {{anything}} more she could do for him, while he lay smiling, intelligently for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> and patiently for what she was doing.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> {{because the}} works in {{question}} {{were by no means}} of the kind one would have expected a professional yacht-hirer to own or to appreciate. He also knew that the forecastle slide was open, and that Valentine was probably listening.|$|E
60|$|But she was not. She had no sailor lover. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{was that}} at {{about this time}} they would be {{lighting}} up the shop-windows in London, and {{that of all the}} deadly, depressing spots she had ever visited this village of Millbourne was the deadliest.|$|E
5000|$|Barth {{received}} {{a bachelor of}} arts degree from the University of California, Davis and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles. From 1990 to 2008, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{a professor in the}} Art Department of the University of California, Riverside, where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> currently a professor of art emeritus. After receiving the MacArthur Fellowship in October 2012, she noted that she still plans to teach on a part-time basis because teaching forces her to [...] "put language to" [...] <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aya Kozakai is Hatsuyuki’s senior by one year. She {{works with}} him at a café filled with dolls, while waiting to get into college after failing the college {{entrance}} exam. <b>She</b> used to <b>be</b> the student council president and was the perfect student everyone looked up to but did not dare to get close to. No one knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking,</b> but <b>she</b> has a curious familiarity with Hatsuyuki despite having already graduated and supposedly never spending time with him before working at the café.|$|R
60|$|The {{folly of}} a man is a thing {{sometimes}} outside his own power of control. A second before I had been wondering of whom and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dale read Helen's mind, or else his own {{thoughts}} were in harmony with hers, for he always seemed to speak <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking.</b> And as they rode homeward he asked her in his quiet way if they could not spare {{a few days to}} visit his old camp.|$|E
60|$|We all enjoyed our {{turnovers}} except Sara Ray. She ate hers but {{she knew}} she should not have done so. Her mother did not approve of snacks between meals, or of jam turnovers at any time. Once, when Sara was in a brown study, I asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course," [...] Mrs. March now assented, and {{she waved}} her fan thoughtfully before her face. I knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of, and I looked at Miss Gage, who had involuntarily taken the pose and {{expression}} of the moment when I first saw her at the kiosk in Congress Park. [...] "And Miss Gage?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was exactly}} {{what he might have}} expected, what indeed had been {{at the back of his}} mind all along, and on the whole he <b>was</b> glad. Naturally <b>she</b> hesitated; {{naturally}} she wanted time to think, and as naturally it was impossible for her to tell him <b>what</b> it <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> about.|$|R
50|$|Marcel waits downstairs for Pierre {{to return}} home and shoots him three times. Marcel then flees, but is shot dead by police. Séverine's husband survives, but is left in a coma. The police are {{unable to find a}} motive for the {{attempted}} murder. Sometime later Séverine is at home taking care of Pierre, who is now completely paralyzed and in a wheelchair. Husson visits Pierre to tell him the truth about his wife's secret life; she does not try to stop him. Afterwards, in an ambiguous ending, Séverine is amazed when Pierre suddenly gets out of his wheel chair and pours himself a drink. He asks <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about. <b>She</b> admits that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about him.|$|R
60|$|Randal {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{could possibly}} <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of and acknowledged it {{in so many}} words.|$|R
60|$|Poor Cassy! {{when she}} recovered, {{turned her face}} to the wall, and wept and sobbed like a child,--perhaps, mother, you can tell <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of! Perhaps you cannot,--but she felt as sure, in that hour, that God had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,--as she did, months afterwards,--when--but we anticipate.|$|E
60|$|Little Dorrit was silent; {{sensible}} {{that she}} was not to be heard on any question affecting the family dignity, and unwilling to lose to no purpose her sister's newly and unexpectedly restored favour. She could not concur, but she was silent. Fanny well knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of; so well, that she soon asked her.|$|E
60|$|He {{took two}} {{carefully}} wrapped bottles {{out of the}} bag, and the major's eyes twinkled, while as he spread {{out the rest of}} its contents Grace felt her heart grow very soft towards him. He had, it seemed, thought of everything that could minister to her comfort. Then she saw that he had guessed <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> and his honesty became apparent.|$|E
6000|$|Poor foolish, lovely, happy Olive! <b>She</b> {{scarcely}} understood <b>what</b> {{had happened}} to her. She only knew that <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> born and had lived, and had grown, that he might come to her and say he loved her. <b>What</b> had <b>she</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> of all this time? ...|$|R
6000|$|How nicely {{she spoke}} too! nice {{clear-cut}} words! She {{made him feel}} what slush his own accent was. And that last silly remark. What was it? 'Not being the other gentleman, you know!' No point in it. And 'GENTLEMAN!' <b>What</b> COULD <b>she</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of him? ...|$|R
50|$|Night and Day {{throws up}} themes of colonization, journalism, language, and {{alternate}} or multiple realities. The plot narrative unfolds through the silent or subconscious thoughts of Ruth Carson, {{who is a}} by-stander to the main events taking place around her. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> regularly shown to express conflicting ideas between <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> saying, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> actually <b>thinking.</b>|$|R
