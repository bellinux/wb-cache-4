Jin gives Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) a flower, Charlie talks with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) and Sawyer brings some beer for Kate but finds that she isn't around. Meanwhile, Kate meets up with John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and Sayid on her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), who she hopes to get help from. Locke reveals he has compass readings from Mr. Eko's stick. Kate's recruiting of Rousseau seems to fail until she mentions her suspicions about Alex, who helped Kate escape, being Rousseau's daughter.|$|E

Olivia (Anna Torv) and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) escort him home, discovering his house is in disarray. After they ask why he didn't {{come to them}} for help, Walter replies he needs to learn to care for himself if Peter fails to return. He discovers a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Peter using his unique energy signature, but changes his mind after worrying that Peter will not forgive him. However, Olivia learns Peter's whereabouts from Broyles; they prepare to fly to Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. He thought of an online email directory as an easier to <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth, 1600), in which Gilbert described his experiments which led {{to the conclusion that the}} Earth was magnetic, and introduced the term electricus to describe the phenomenon of static electricity produced by rubbing amber (called ēlectrum in Classical Latin, derived from ήλεκτρον (elektron) in Ancient Greek). According to the mathematician and physician Mark Ridley, chapter 12 of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how astronomical observations could be used to determine the magnetic variation, was actually Wright's work.|$|E

Further, abandoning England as well as their faith was often a way to financial success, as fortunes could be made by attacking Christian shipping. By 1610, the wealth of English renegade pirates had become so famous as to become the object of plays, and the king offered Royal Pardon to those who wished to return.|$|E

25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes {{at the end of a}} very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
25|$|While testing {{an early}} 1.5m set the team failed to detect any aircraft, but easily picked out large objects like cranes and ships at nearby wharves. Further {{experiments}} demonstrated {{the ability to}} pick up ships at sea, leading to a live demonstration where the team was able to track down Royal Navy capital ships in terrible weather. This led to immediate interest on behalf of RAF Coastal Command which saw this as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> enemy ships and U-Boats, and by the British Army, which was interested in using the radars to direct fire against shipping in the English Channel.

25|$|Healthy {{humans have}} two kidneys, a {{redundancy}} that enables living donors (inter vivos) {{to give a}} kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E

25|$|This {{difference}} {{is one of}} the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as Match.com, Yahoo Personals, and eHarmony.com are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like MySpace and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users. The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> dates online.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste {{no time at all}} in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E
25|$|The spathe {{provides}} a safe breeding {{area for the}} beetles. As such, the male beetles are often followed by female beetles {{with the intent of}} mating with the males within the spathe. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process and thus providing philodendrons a means of sexual reproduction. In addition to gaining a safe location to mate, the male beetles may benefit from having a central location, because it allows them to broadcast to females that they are willing and able to mate. Females which see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because {{they do not have to}} produce pheromones to attract females, since the philodendrons do it for them. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females, which is not necessarily certain otherwise. In doing so, the philodendron provides male beetles a more efficient <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> females than what they could achieve on their own. Interestingly, pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. In addition to the reproductive benefits to beetles, the philodendrons provide food in two forms. Pollen from the fertile male flowers is eaten by the beetles throughout the night. Secondly, the sterile male flowers consumed by the beetles are rich in lipids.|$|E
