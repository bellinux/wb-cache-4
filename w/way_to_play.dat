The second book, Arlott wrote, was [...] "to the best of this reviewer's knowledge, the first cricket book to be initially published in the modern paper-back format".

He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, [...] "'I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don't believe there are any.'" [...] Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were [...] "'salesman for professional football [...] we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> football.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} game's accessibility. Calixto of Kill Screen said that Videoball countered {{a trend in}} games culture that relied on {{learning}} professional strategies online in order to play competitively. He cited the affordances for experimentation in the game's controls and saw Videoball as being primarily concerned with awakening [...] "its own brand of DIY metagaming", hence the reviewer's interest in naming his own techniques. Calixto further praised the game for resisting the standardization of one correct <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with its variety of game fields. While Rowen (Destructoid) doubted that Videoball would be the future of eSports, he concluded that the game made for good local multiplayer fun, and vastly preferred the experience of local to online multiplayer. He compared the title to Super Bomberman in how quickly the game escalates from a friendly match to cut-throat competition.|$|E

500|$|Szigeti {{also offers}} a lengthy and {{detailed}} explanation of his approach to violin technique. He believed that a violinist should be concerned primarily with musical goals, rather than simply choosing either the easiest or most impressively virtuosic <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a certain passage. He was particularly concerned with tone color: he advised that [...] "The player should cultivate a seismograph-like sensitivity to brusque changes of tone colour caused by fingerings based on expediency and comfort rather than the composer’s manifest or probable intentions." [...] Other topics prominently discussed include the most effective position of a violinist's left hand, the violin works of Béla Bartók, a cautionary list of widely accepted misprints and editorial inaccuracies in the standard repertoire, and most notably, the vital importance of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas for any violinist's technical and artistic development.|$|E

Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being a good <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it {{was born out of}} the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E
500|$|Game Informers three reviewers {{praised the}} Saturn and PlayStation ports of Command & Conquer.

Andrew Reiner agreed, calling it a [...] "flawless PC port" [...] that [...] "perfectly" [...] recreates the thrills of the original; but he was displeased that it did not feature multiplayer support. Jon Storm summarized it as [...] "an excellent addition to any PlayStation or Saturn library." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation wrote: [...] "Just like the ported Saturn version, PSX [...] C adds little to the existing game." [...] The review's author cited the lower resolution and lack of multiplayer as low points, but noted that the addition of the Covert Operations missions [...] "adds to the overall replay value".|$|E
