[...] As a result, the fortifications in the new sector represent a wide variety of types and degrees of fortification. The Sedan sub-sector comprises two distinct lines, with fortified houses close to the border and a line of blockhouses along the line of the Meuse. The houses were built in 1938 by the Military <b>Works</b> <b>organization</b> (Main d'Oeuvre Militaire (MOM)), while the blockhouses were built primarily by the Army Engineer Service (Service Technique du Génie (STG)), beginning in 1936. The Mouzon sub-sector was organized similarly. A number of blockhouses were built to local designs, such as the FCR or Billotte blocks of the Sedan sub-sector.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} specific contribution of occupation and <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> conditions on psychological distress, {{based on a}} representative sample of 9501 workers in 419 occupations in Quebec, Canada. Multilevel regression models show that occupational structure accounts for 0. 8 % of variation in psychological distress. Among the constraints and resources related to <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> condition, physical and psychological demands, irregular schedules, and workplace harassment emerge as important determinants of psychological distress. The effects of <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> conditions do not vary across occupations. Family situation, support available from social networks outside work, and personal characteristics of individuals are also associated with psychological distress, but these factors do not moderate the effects of <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> conditions. Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that occupation and, to an even greater extent, "pathogenic" <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> conditions contribute independently to the experience of psychological distress. They also support the theoretical model conceptualizing psychological distress as the product of stress caused by constraints and resources brought to bear simultaneously by the agent's personality, structures of daily life, and macrosocial structures.

40|$|New job {{structures}} and qualification requirements with {{computer aided design}} (CAD) systems are not only technologically induced but also {{a result of the}} type of <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> realized in firms. This book describes the trends in <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> in the case of CAD use by collecting representative information from 164 German enterprises. The major findings are the following: There is no spezialization of work places evident as a consequence of CAD use. On the contrary, the job profiles of design ingeneers and especially draughtsmen have become broader. The latter have additional tasks in the specification of designs and the compliation of bill of materials. Despite of these slight changes in <b>work</b> <b>organization</b> the analyses showed no fundamental new organizational concepts in CAD installing firms. Nearly all enterprises keep their old type of <b>work</b> <b>organization.</b> The degreee of division of labour persists whether it is high or low. The new options which the CAD technology offers are con current with an organizational conservatism. The survey shows that, more than the CAD technology, some aspects of the frame conditions in the enterprises are influencing the <b>work</b> <b>organization.</b> Wholistic {{job structures}} can be found especially in small firms, in firms with many CAD stations in relation to the design employees, infirms with "low-cost" CAD-systems, in firms without computer integrated manufacturing concepts and in those with elaborated training concepts for all employees. other aspects like branches, batch size etc. are not significantly interrelated with the type of <b>work</b> <b>organization...</b>|$|R
