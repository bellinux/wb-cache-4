500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all {{had to be done}} and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E

[...] Hamlin, the points leader before the race, described his disappointment by saying, [...] "I’m disappointed. Our car was lightning fast until that last wreck. When we hit the 16 (Biffle) that knocked the toe-in out. It wasn’t as fast after that. It’s just circumstances but we had a great year. We won the most races (8) and we contended like we have never contended before but circumstances took us out of this one. I don’t think the 48 (Johnson) showed the strength this year like they did in the past and that opened the door for the rest of us." [...] Harvick, who finished third in points, stated: ...|$|E

500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E
500|$|The Pumpkins drew {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that [...] "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" [...] and that they [...] "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East. The song [...] "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed [...] "cybermetal." [...] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, [...] "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as [...] "the Pumpkin chord" [...] (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for [...] "Cherub Rock", [...] "Drown", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer.|$|E

500|$|Michigan {{suffered}} an 80–70 overtime loss {{at the hands}} of ten-place Big Ten foe, Iowa, on February 22. Michigan had led 56–52 with 1 minute and 13 seconds remaining in regulation before allowing four straight free throws by Matt Gatens. [...] The game was notable because Harris did not play during the overtime. [...] At the time of the benching, Harris was in a battle with fellow sophomores Talor Battle and Evan Turner for the Big Ten Scoring leadership. [...] Beilein commented on the benching: [...] "That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to make our team better now and in the future.". [...] In the subsequent game against #16-ranked Purdue, Michigan won 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season. Harris was one of Michigan's leaders with 27 points and 8 rebounds, while Sims had a career-high 29 points. [...] On March 1, Michigan lost to Wisconsin 60–55. After taking a 34–32 halftime lead, Michigan opened the second half shooting 1 for 12. Michigan closed the contest to a 52–50 game with 3 minutes and 55 seconds remaining. They stayed close as Wisconsin missed four of eight late free throws. [...] Prior to the final game of the season, the Wolverines adopted the slogan [...] "Queme los barcos," [...] which means [...] "burn the ships" [...] and which had been used by 16th-century Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez as a command to his troops to remind them that there was no turning back in their battle with the Aztec. The team traded in their traditional warmup jersey's for shirts with their adopted slogan. [...] On March 7, they recovered from a 51–39 deficit to win their conference finale against Minnesota. Laval Lucas-Perry scored a career-high 19 points, including three straight three-pointers after Minnesota opened up the 12-point lead. Of the three teams that were ranked at the end of February and that Michigan had played twice (Duke, Illinois and Purdue), Michigan split the two games against each opponent, winning against each at home.|$|E

2500|$|Microsoft {{has made}} an effort to {{maintain}} backward compatibility. To achieve this, when developing new versions of Windows, Microsoft sometimes implemented workarounds to allow compatibility with third-party software that used the prior version in an undocumented or even inadvisable way. Raymond Chen, a Microsoft developer who works on the Windows API, has said: [...] "I could probably write for months solely about bad things apps do and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to get them to work again (often in spite of themselves).

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band.

2500|$|After Jackson {{retired in}} 2011, Buss {{explicitly}} told coaching candidates Brian Shaw and Mike Brown that Bynum needed {{to receive the}} ball inside. Shaw was passed over as Jackson's replacement although the Lakers assistant was openly supported by players. Buss instead hired Brown without consulting their star player, Kobe Bryant. He later {{said it was a}} mistake to not involve Bryant. Shaw was not bitter that the Lakers went with Brown, but he was disappointed that after 12 years of service, they did not contact him until three weeks after their decision. The well-respected Shaw atypically criticized Buss in a radio interview over his treatment during the hiring cycle. The offseason also included the NBA player lockout, during which the Lakers let go of nearly two dozen employees with a combined 100 years of experience from the basketball operations staff. Assistant General Manager Ronnie Lester, whose contract was not renewed after 24 years with the team, said [...] "great organizations don't treat their personnel like they've done." [...] CBSSports.com wrote that NBA executives are typically discreet, and Lester's public criticism [...] "shows how strongly he feels the Lakers were in the wrong here".
