If, therefore, from {{the laws of}} space and number, we were able to deduce uniformities of any other description, this would be conclusive evidence to us that those other uniformities possessed the same rigorous certainty.

60|$|Escaped {{from the}} house of bondage, Israel of old did not follow after {{the ways of the}} Egyptians. To her was given an express dispensation; to her were given new things under the sun. And we Americans are the peculiar, chosen people--the Israel of our time; we bear the ark of the liberties of the world. Seventy years ago we escaped from thrall; and, besides our first birthright--embracing one {{continent}} of earth--God has given to us, for a future inheritance, the broad domains of the political pagans, that shall yet come and lie down under the shade of our ark, without bloody hands being lifted. God has predestinated, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls. The rest of the nations must soon be in our rear. We are the pioneers of the world; the advance-guard, sent on through the wilderness of untried things, to break a new path in the New World that is ours. In our youth is our strength; in our inexperience, our wisdom. At a period when other nations have but lisped, our deep voice is heard afar. Long enough, have we been skeptics with regard to ourselves, and doubted whether, indeed, the political Messiah had come. But he has come in us, if we would but give utterance to his promptings.

60|$|It is, indeed, {{hardly ever}} possible, even after history has {{suggested}} the derivative law, {{to demonstrate a}} priori that such was the only order of succession or of co-existence in which the effects could, consistently with the laws of human nature, have been produced. We can at most make out that there were strong a priori reasons for expecting it, and that no other order of succession or co-existence {{would have been so}} likely to result from the nature of man and the general circumstances of his position. Often <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> even this; we can not even show that what did take place was probable a priori, but only that it was possible. This, however—which, in the Inverse Deductive Method that we are now characterizing, is a real process of verification—is as indispensable, as verification by specific experience has been shown to be, where the conclusion is originally obtained by the direct way of deduction. The empirical laws must be the result of but a few instances, since few nations have ever attained at all, and still fewer by their own independent development, a high stage of social progress. If, therefore, even one or two of these few instances be insufficiently known, or imperfectly analyzed into their elements, and therefore not adequately compared with other instances, nothing is more probable than that a wrong empirical law will emerge instead of the right one. Accordingly, the most erroneous generalizations are continually made from the course of history; not only in this country, where history can not yet be said to be at all cultivated as a science, but in other countries where it is so cultivated, and by persons well versed in it. The only check or corrective is, constant verification by psychological and ethological laws. We may add to this, that no one but a person competently skilled in those laws is capable of preparing the materials for historical generalization, by analyzing the facts of history, or even by observing the social phenomena of his own time. No other will be aware of the comparative importance of different facts, nor consequently know what facts to look for, or to observe; still less will he be capable of estimating the evidence of facts which, {{as is the case with}} most, can not be ascertained by direct observation or learned from testimony, but must be inferred from marks.|$|E

60|$|Although, however, direct {{verification}} is impossible, {{there is}} an indirect verification, which is scarcely of less value, and which is always practicable. The conclusion drawn as to the individual case can only be directly verified in that case; but it is verified indirectly, by the verification of other conclusions, drawn in other individual cases from the same laws. The experience which comes too late to verify the particular proposition to which it refers, is {{not too late to}} help toward verifying the general sufficiency of the theory. The test of the degree in which the science affords safe ground for predicting (and consequently for practically dealing with) what has not yet happened, is the degree in which it would have enabled us to predict what has actually occurred. Before our theory of the influence of a particular cause, in a given state of circumstances, can be entirely trusted, we must be able to explain and account for the existing state of all that portion of the social phenomena which that cause has a tendency to influence. If, for instance, we would apply our speculations in political economy to the prediction or guidance of the phenomena of any country, we must be able to explain all the mercantile or industrial facts of a general character, appertaining to the present state of that country; to point out causes sufficient to account for all of them, and prove, or show good ground for supposing, that these causes have really existed. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> this, it is a proof either that the facts which ought {{to be taken into account}} are not yet completely known to us, or that although we know the facts, we are not masters of a sufficiently perfect theory to enable us to assign their consequences. In either case we are not, in the present state of our knowledge, fully competent to draw conclusions, speculative or practical, for that country. In like manner, if we would attempt to judge of the effect which any political institution would have, supposing that it could be introduced into any given country, we must be able to show that the existing state of the practical government of that country, and of whatever else depends thereon, together with the particular character and tendencies of the people, and their state in respect to the various elements of social well-being, are such as the institutions they have lived under, in conjunction with the other circumstances of their nature or of their position, were calculated to produce.|$|E

Ello se hace poniendo de relieve las relaciones que existen entre las respuestas a las preguntas siguientes: ¿por qué castigar?, ¿cuánto castigar?, ¿a quién castigar?, ¿cómo castigar? Se muestra que respecto a los posibles objetivos de la pena (¿por qué castigar?), sólo cabe una justificación basada en la incapacitación, pero esto supone no poder justificar un tiempo determinado de imposición de pena (¿cuánto castigar?). El examen del problema del determinismo, por su lado, muestra que no podemos prescindir del retribucionismo en la distribución (¿a quién castigar?). Todo lo {{anterior}} llevará, por último, a formular un dilema respecto a la llamada «castración química» (¿cómo castigar?).

It is held that with respect to the possible goals of punishment (the why of punishment), there is only a justification based on the incapacitation, but this implies not being able to justify a determinate time of imposition of punishment (the how much to punish).

40|$|Abstract. A {{fundamental}} goal of computational complexity (and {{foundations of}} cryptography) {{is to find}} a polynomial-time samplable distribution (e. g., the uniform distribution) and a language in NTIME(f(n)) for some polynomial function f, such that the language is hard on the average with respect to this distribution, given that NP is worst-case hard (i. e. NP � = P, or NP � ⊆ BPP). Currently, no such result is known even if we relax the language to be in nondeterministic sub-exponential time. There has been a long line of research trying to explain our failure in proving such worst-case/average-case connections [FF 93,Vio 03,BT 03,AGGM 06]. The bottom line of this research is essentially that (under plausible assumptions) non-adaptive Turing reductions cannot prove such results. In this paper we revisit the problem. Our first observation is that the above mentioned negative arguments extend to a non-standard notion of average-case complexity, in which the distribution on the inputs with respect to which we measure the average-case complexity of the language, is only samplable in super-polynomial time. The significance of this result {{stems from the fact that}} in this non-standard setting, [GSTS 05] did show a worst-case/average-case connection. In other words, their techniques give a way to bypass the impossibility arguments. By taking a closer look at the proof of [GSTS 05], we discover that the worst-case/averagecase connection is proven by a reduction that ”almost ” falls under the category ruled out by the negative result. This gives rise to an intriguing new notion of (almost black-box) reductions. After extending the negative results to the non-standard average-case setting of [GSTS 05], we ask whether their positive result can be extended to the standard setting, to prove some new worst-case/average-case connections. While <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> that unconditionally, we are able to show that under a mild derandomization assumption, the worst-case hardness of NP implies the average-case hardness of NTIME(f(n)) (under the uniform distribution) where f is computable in quasi-polynomial time. ...|$|E

Any extraordinary event can be explained by the action of internal agents unknown to us, and their ability to alter the reality is not necessarily superior to even our own capabilities. The only thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> – is to change the source code of being (e. g., fundamental physical constants). This could make only creatures that are not spelled out in these source codes. However, people have not seen anything like it, and scarcely become witnesses of such events...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} bauxite {{occur in the}} Jajarm Bauxite deposit, {{the first one is}} the hard bauxite and the other is the shaly bauxite or soft bauxite. The Al 2 O 3 content ranges from 30 % to 60 % and SiO 2 varies between 5 % to 39 %. The total tonnage is more than 22 million tons with a mean value of Al 2 O 3 content between 47 % to 48 %, SiO 2 around 10 % and Fe 2 O 3 ranges between 6. 95 to 27 %. The Jajarm bauxite deposit shows high {{concentration}} of active SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 in comparison with other bauxite deposits of the world. Efforts have been made in this research to delineate the characteristics of the Jajarm monohydrate bauxites, consisting of a diaspore and chamosite mixture, to improve their chemistry by different beneficiation techniques and optimize their processing, grinding and digestion conditions for alumina production The Jajarm bauxite shows politomorphic and micro- granular texture with several secondary textural elements. The size of diaspore grains (which is the main mineral component) are generally below 10 microns, with a homogeneous matrix. In addition, for the very hard bauxite <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> any separation between the crystal grains and the matrix because of similar hardness for both with closely packed space filling and in consequence of the absence of well- defined grain boundaries. Based on the above studies, the Jajarm bauxite can be enriched neither by grain analysis nor by magnetic separation. In this research hard bauxite was crushed between 2 to 3 inches and then samples were washed with 5 % HCl. The result of this laboratory studies shows that the silica modulus has improved from 1. 05 to 2. 56 which indicates an increase of 29 % in the Al 2 O 3 content. Jajarm laboratory s study shows that Jajarm bauxite deposit partially can be improved only by water treatment...|$|E
6000|$|... § 5. Proceeding {{with the}} {{enumeration}} of a priori fallacies, and endeavoring to arrange them {{with as much}} reference as possible to their natural affinities, we come to another, which is also nearly allied to the fallacy preceding the last, standing in the same relation to one variety {{of it as the}} fallacy last mentioned does to the other. This, too, represents nature as under incapacities corresponding to those of our intellect; but instead of only asserting that nature <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> a thing because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> conceive it <b>done,</b> goes the still greater length of averring that nature does a particular thing, on the sole ground that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see no reason why she should not. Absurd as this seems when so plainly stated, it is a received principle among scientific authorities for demonstrating a priori the laws of physical phenomena. A phenomenon must follow a certain law, because we see no reason why it should deviate from that law in one way rather than in another. This is called the Principle of the Sufficient Reason;(239) and by means of it philosophers often flatter themselves that they are able to establish, without any appeal to experience, the most general truths of experimental physics.|$|R
60|$|The {{second point}} I {{want to make}} about {{instruction}} {{is the importance of}} youth. In America, where they contemplate a labour shortage of 2,000,000 men on their farms, they are using boys from sixteen to twenty-one, when their military age begins. <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> the same here? Most of our boys from fifteen to eighteen are now on other work. But the work they are doing could surely be done by girls or women. If we could put even a couple of hundred thousand boys of that age on the land it would be the solution of our present agricultural labour shortage, and the very best thing that could happen for the future of farming. The boys would learn at first hand; they would learn slowly and thoroughly; and many of them would stay on the land. They might be given specialised schooling in agriculture, the most important schooling <b>we</b> <b>can</b> give our rising generation, while all of them would gain physically. By employing women on the land, where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> employ boys of from fifteen to eighteen, we are blind-alleying. Women will not stay on the land in any numbers; few will wish that they should. Boys will, and every one would wish that they may.|$|R
40|$|Opinions {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} authors and not Knight-Trimark Securities, the National Association of Security Dealers, or Goldman, Sachs & Co. The Relationship between Market-making Revenue, Payment for Order Flow, and Trading Costs for Market Orders We study the division of market-making revenue among dealer, broker, and trader. When Knight Securities, a major Nasdaq dealer, interacts with market orders in actively-traded stocks during the fourth quarter of 1996, we estimate that market-making revenue is $ 0. 057 per share. Knight pays brokers at least $ 0. 025 per share (44 % of revenue) for orders. To examine whether brokers appear to share these payments with traders, we compare net trading costs (trade price net of commissions) for traders using brokers routing Knight orders to estimated net trading costs for traders using the only discount broker <b>we</b> <b>can</b> determine <b>did</b> <b>not</b> directly receive market-making revenue. We find that many orders routed based on order-flow inducements enjoy lower net trading costs, which suggests that payment for order flow <b>does</b> <b>not</b> unambiguously harm traders and challenges the conclusions of extant studies using only trade prices to assess market quality. 1.
