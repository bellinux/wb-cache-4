40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a {{real-time}} approach for visual self-localisation of mobile platforms in dynamic environments is presented. Vision-based approaches for improving motion estimation recently have gained {{a lot of}} attention. Yet methods banking on vision only suffer from <b>wrong</b> <b>tracking</b> of features between frames as the optical flow resulting from the robot motion cannot be distinguished from the one resulting from robot independent motion in the camera images. In {{the scope of this}} work a method for robust visual self-localisation in dynamic environments on the basis of feature prediction using wheel odometry was developed. ...|$|R
25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... interpretive {{schemes that}} {{dominated}} Canadian historical writing {{through the middle}} {{decades of the twentieth}} century were built on the assumption that history had a discernible direction and flow. Canada was moving towards a goal in the nineteenth century; whether this endpoint was the construction of a transcontinental, commercial, and political union, the development of parliamentary government, or the preservation and resurrection of French Canada, it was certainly a Good Thing. Thus the rebels of 1837 were quite literally on the <b>wrong</b> <b>track.</b> They lost because they had to lose; they were not simply overwhelmed by superior force, they were justly chastised by the God of History.|$|E

Since the trains are in dark territory, it was impossible for the train dispatchers to communicate with the trains' engineers to stop the trains to avoid collision. Casey kills the mercenaries one by one and releases the hostages, but Dane uses his computer skills to locate the stealth bombers and re-targets Grazer to knock them out before they can complete their mission. Meanwhile, Penn had previously captured Sarah and uses her as bait for Casey. Casey confronts Penn and breaks his neck after a fight that spills into the kitchen.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for automatic selection and transfer of corresponding image points in digital video (DV) image sequences. This approach utilizes and extends some well-known techniques and theories (e. g. the optical flow theory) {{as well as a}} designed simple error-detection mechanism to achieve a much better efficiency than the well-known Lucas-Kanade optical flow estimation (LK) method. Our test results use the SONY DCR-PC 115 DV image sequences and show that the trackable range of 3 - 4 pixels in the LK method can apparently be enlarged to 30 pixels in this new approach. The proposed error-detection mechanism simply utilizes the average gradient, normalized cross-correlation, and a simple image registration aided by least squares adjustment. Test results show that it can efficiently detect and delete <b>wrong</b> <b>tracked</b> points, and thus improve the quality of point transfer, and provide accurate coordinates {{of a large number of}} corresponding image points in DV image sequences. This work aims at high precision automatic image triangulation for the automatic real-time mobile mapping vehicle system (MMVS). Some future works need to be done...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{integrated}} tracking and segmentation of 3 D Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. The conventional processing pipeline of object tracking methods performs the segmentation and tracking modules consecutively. They apply a connected component algorithm on a grid for object segmentation. This {{results in an}} under-segmentation and in turn <b>wrong</b> <b>tracking</b> estimates when there are spatially close objects. We present a new approach in which segmentation and tracking modules profit from each other to resolve ambiguities in complex dynamic scenes. A non-parametric Bayesian method, the sequential distance dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (s-ddCRP), enables us to combine segmentation and tracking components. After a pre-processing step which maps measurements to a grid representation, the proposed method tracks each grid cell and segments the environment in an integrated way. A smoothing algorithm {{is applied to the}} estimated grid cell velocities for be tter motion consistency of neighboring dynamic grid cells. Experiments on data obtained with a Velodyne HDL 64 scanner in real traffic scenarios illustrate that the proposed approach has a encouraging detection performance and conclusive motion consistency between consecutive time frames...|$|R
