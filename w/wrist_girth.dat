The {{prevalence}} of morphological asymmetry amongst sport participants and sedentary individuals {{has been well}} documented. The importance of studies in this field is accentuated {{by the fact that}} morphological asymmetry has a negative effect on the health and performance of elite athletes. The purpose of this study was, therefore, firstly to determine whether significant differences for thirty five anthropometrical measurements exist between the dominant and nondominant sides of male (n = 16) and female (n = 11) crawl stroke swimmers. Dependent t-tests were used for this purpose. All of the measurements were taken twice on both the dominant and nondominant sides of the body, according to the methods described by Norton et al. (1996). Amongst the male swimmers, the (relaxed-, tensed- and corrected-) upper arm girths, <b>wrist</b> <b>girth,</b> thigh girth and lower leg length showed statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences. Amongst the female swimmers statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the thigh girth, upper leg length and foot length. The second purpose was to compare the indices of morphological asymmetry of twenty upper body anthropometrical variables of the male swimmers to that of male fast bowlers (n = 27) and aged-matched sedentary males (n = 27). This comparison was done using an ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests. The indices of morphological asymmetry were determined with Wolaiiski's Relative Indices of Asymmetry (RIA). The RIA for the twenty upper body measurements for the three groups in this comparison are also reported. Statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found for the (relaxed, tensed and corrected) upper arm girths and halfchest girth when the fast bowlers were compared to the male swimmers {{as well as for the}} comparison between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. A statistically significant (p < 0. 05) difference was also found for the hand length between the fast bowlers and the sedentary individuals. To conclude, all four of the measured groups showed indices of morphological asymmetry for certain anthropometrical variables, with the fast bowlers showing the highest indices and the swimmers showing the lowest indices of morphological asymmetry. These results support the notion that swimming may have preventive and therapeutic value for athletes who show a high degree of morphological asymmetry due to participation in unilateral sport types. Further research is, however, required. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the anthropometric characteristics of elite Chinese women volleyball players, identify the differences in the anthropometric profile and physical performance between the players at different volleyball positions, and examine the correlations between the anthropometric profile and the physical performance of the players. Thirty-one anthropometric indices and four physical performance (medicine ball throwing, running vertical jump, T shuttle run agility test and timed 20 sit ups) were measured for 100 volleyball players recruited from the top eight teams of 2007 - 2008 national championship. The average age of the players was 22. 3 ± 3. 6 (SD) years and the average training age was 9. 7 ± 4. 0 years. For the elite Chinese women volleyball players, the average values of stature, body mass, sitting height, standing reach height, and BMI were respectively 183. 6 ± 5. 8 cm, 70. 5 ± 7. 6 kg, 95. 7 ± 3. 5 cm, 236. 7 ± 7. 8 cm, and 20. 9 ± 2. 0. The overall anthropometric characteristics of these volleyball players can be described as high stature; relatively longer forearm, palm, calf and Achilles’ tendon lengths but a shorter sitting height; wider femur, biiliocristal and biacromial breadths; larger difference between relaxed and tensed arm <b>girth,</b> smaller <b>wrist</b> and ankle <b>girths,</b> smaller ankle girth / Achilles’ tendon length index; and smaller skinfolds. The results also revealed that most of the anthropometric variables were poorly correlated with the selected physical performance measurements, except that the biepicondylar femur breadth, calf girth and calf length indices were significantly correlated with the running jump height. There were significant differences among the anthropometric profiles of the players at different volleyball positions, especially in the indices of body mass, stature, standing reach height, radiale-stylion length, acromiale-dactylion length, midstylion-dactylion length, iliospinale height, tibiale-laterale height length, biacromial breadth, biiliocristal breadth, transverse chest breadth and gluteal girth (all P 3 ̆c 0. 001). However, the physical performance of the players at different positions showed no significant between-position difference except the running jump height. The average somatoype values of elite Chinese women volleyball players were “ 3. 7 - 2. 9 - 4. 0 ”, belonging to endomorph-ectomorph. Their somatoypes were found mainly in four of the 13 categories, with 29...|$|R
