Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the chowtal songs from the springtime festival phagwa, and Hindi bhajans which are still sung at temples despite there being few people <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that {{was referred to as}} local music.|$|E

25|$|A {{typology}} of academic misconduct has been devised by Perry (2010). Perry's typology presents a two dimensional model of academic misconduct with one dimension measuring {{the degree to}} which rules are understood and the other dimension measuring how closely these rules are followed. According to the typology only those students <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the rules but fail to adhere to the rules are classified as 'cheats'.|$|E
25|$|As with Esperanto, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} for a flag of Interlingua; the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites. It consists of a white four-pointed star extending {{to the edges of}} the flag and dividing it into an upper blue and lower red half. The star is symbolic of the four cardinal directions, and the two halves symbolize Romance and non-Romance speakers of Interlingua <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> each other.|$|E

25|$|Within the United States, social {{location}} {{affects the}} way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.

25|$|Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout {{with the}} QWERTY keyboard, {{is much more}} {{commonly}} used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, {{there is only one}} unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.|$|E
25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The earliest Christians believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the earliest Christian writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic {{some time in the}} early 2nd century.|$|E

25|$|Noting {{that this}} {{economic}} system is firmly entrenched {{and difficult to}} overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation {{of large numbers of}} people <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way. Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened {{as a result of the}} upheaval.|$|E

This paradox has led Icke, who argues that Christian Patriots are the only Americans <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> {{the truth about the}} New World Order (which he believes is controlled by a race of reptilians known as the [...] "Babylonian Brotherhood"), to reportedly tell a Christian Patriot group: ...|$|E

Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as [...] "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E

Although Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the New World Order, he also told a Christian patriot group: [...] "I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with". James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message is hopeful, and that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicholson's {{feud with}} Andros persisted, and Nicholson {{acquired}} a powerful ally in James Blair, {{the founder of}} the College of William and Mary. [...] The two were able to gain the support of the Anglican establishment in England against Andros, and filed a long list of complaints with the Lords of Trade. [...] These efforts were successful in convincing Andros to request permission to resign, and in December 1698, Nicholson was given the governorship of Virginia. [...] Andros angrily refused to give Nicholson his records. [...] During his term, which lasted until 1705, Nicholson was largely at the mercy of his council, which was dominated by a small group of powerful Virginia families. [...] The Andros rule had been so unpopular in Virginia that Nicholson's instructions gave him little leeway in acting without their consent. [...] At one point Nicholson characterized the Virginia council as [...] "mere brutes <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> not manners". [...] Nicholson made a number of unsuccessful attempts to alter the balance of power, including moving the provincial capital from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, which was renamed Williamsburg. [...] Although he was opposed by the upper house, the colonial legislature was generally supportive of him, and he continued to be favored by the London government.|$|E
500|$|Use of the Saltire at sea as a Jack or {{courtesy}} flag has been observed, including as a Jack on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) Jura. [...] The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a Jack on vessels {{which have a}} bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating {{in and around the}} Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a jack or {{courtesy flag}}, may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, [...] "MIKE", which is used to indicate [...] "My vessel is stopped; making no way." [...] Obviously mariners <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> this signal code also understand that the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.|$|E
