40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} {{of different}} cellulosic fibres during acid hydrolysis {{has been investigated}} and the levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) has been determined. The study included a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp (both never-dried and once-dried) and two dissolving pulps (once-dried). Additionally, cotton cellulose from new cotton sheets and sheets discarded after long-time use was studied. Experimental results from the investigation, together with results found in literature, imply that ultrastructural differences between different fibres affect their susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis. Drying of a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp was found to enhance the rate of acid hydrolysis and also result in a decrease in LODP. This implies that the susceptibility of cellulosic fibres towards acid hydrolysis is affected by drying-induced stresses in the cellulose chains. In cotton cellulose, {{it was found that}} use and laundering gave a substantial loss in the degree of polymerisation (DP), but that the LODP was only marginally affected...|$|R

40|$|Fully <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> {{bamboo pulp}} (BPFs), fully <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> {{softwood}} pulp (SPFs), and {{bleached cotton linter}} pulp (CPFs), which have different crystallinities, were oxidized in the TEMPO-NaBr-NaClO system with ultrasonic treatment for producing nanocrystals. The carboxylate content of nanocrystals made from BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were 2. 10, 2. 02, and 1. 66 mmol/g, respectively. Nanocrystals of BPFs and SPFs had widths of 5 to 15 nm and lengths of 400 to 800 nm. The length and width of CPFs nanocrystals were 200 to 400 nm and 15 to 25 nm. The oxidizing rates of BPFs, SPFs, and CPFs were different. These differences {{could be attributed to}} crystallinity. Crystallinity affected microstructures, chemical process, and the efficiency of ultrasonication. Crystallinity also shaped the nanocrystals, since nanocrystals consist of the residual crystalline regions after chemical oxidation and ultrasonication. Fibers of lower crystallinity (such as bamboo) showed a higher reactivity, and the nanocrystals made from low crystallinity materials were longer, thinner, more rapidly formed, and required less energy in their preparation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{compared}} the conventional activated sludge process to the Powdered Activated Carbon Treatment (PACTTM) {{process for the}} treatment of a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> mill effluent. The PACTTM process involves the addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) to the aeration basin of an activated sludge system. Powdered activated carbon has a very high surface area and is able to adsorb large amounts of hydrophobic compounds, such as organochlorines. This process was selected because it was likely to increase the removals of toxins including adsorbable organics halides (AOX) and because it had not been evaluated for this type of wastewater. Bench scale continuous flow reactors, with internal sludge recycle, were used in this study. The design and process control parameters varied included hydraulic retention time, solids retention time and powdered activated carbon dose. PAC doses of 0. 1 - 1. 0 g/L were used. Four feeds were used in this study, which were collected at different times, from a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp mill batch operation.

40|$|The {{transport}} {{between different}} equipment and unit operations {{plays an important}} role in pulp and paper mills because fiber suspensions differ from all other solid-liquid systems, due to the complex interactions between the different pulp and paper components. Poor understanding of the suspensions’ flow dynamics means the industrial equipment design is usually conservative and frequently oversized, thus contributing to excessive energy consumption in the plants. Our study aim was to obtain additional knowledge about the dynamic behavior of industrial pulp suspensions in order to evaluate the relative importance of the factors that influence pressure drop. To obtain mathematical correlations to quantify pressure drop for the transport of pulp suspensions, we studied four different industrial pulp suspensions (recycled pulp, eucalypt <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp, pine unbleached kraft pulp, and eucalypt [90 %] + pine [10 %] <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp) in a pilot rig specially designed and built for the effect.

40|$|Conservation {{of water}} in <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp mills by {{recycling}} the bleach plant effluent directly without treatment will cause accumulation of inorganic ''non-process elements'' (NPEs) and serious operational problems. In this work, an electrodialysis process is being developed for recycling the acidic bleach plant effluent of <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp mills. In this process, electrodialysis functions as a selective kidney to remove inorganic NPEs from bleach plant effluents, {{before they reach the}} recovery cycle. Acidic bleach plant effluents from several mills using bleaching sequences based on chlorine dioxide were characterized. The total dissolved solids were mostly inorganic NPEs. Sodium was the predominant cation and chloride was present at significant levels in all these effluents. In laboratory electrodialysis experiments, selective removal of chloride and potentially harmful cations, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium, were removed efficiently. Rejection of organic compounds was up to 98 %. Electrodialysis was shown to be resistant to membrane fouling and scaling, in a 100 -hour laboratory experiment. Based on a model mill with 1, 000 ton/day pulp production, the economic analysis suggests that the energy cost of electrodialysis is less than $ 200 /day, and the capital cost of the stack is about $ 500, 000...|$|R

40|$|When making paper, {{fibers and}} {{additives}} are suspended in {{water to a}} fiber suspension. The sheet is formed by draining a specific amount of suspension through a wire-cloth. The procedure is well known, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. To understand how the different particles such as fines, fibers, retention aids and other additives interact with each other, further research is needed.

In this study fluorescence microscopy was used to study fines from <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp which were labeled with fluorophores. When the fines exhibit fluorescence we can study their individual trajectories and understand more about the interactions between fibers, fines and additives in different chemical environments. Fines from <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp have no fluorescent properties and therefore it is necessary to bind a fluorophore to the material.

40|$|Xylan {{is known}} to adsorb irreversibly on {{cellulose}} and on <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> pulp fibres. This investigation shows that adsorption of birch glucuronoxylan (GX) reduces the degree of drying-induced property changes of <b>bleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> pulp fibres. GX was adsorbed at different amounts on never-dried fibres, which provided pulps with xylan contents ranging from 67 to 126 mg/g. By fluorescent labelling of the GX, followed by adsorption and subsequent imaging using confocal laser scanning microscopy, {{it was concluded that}} GX adsorbs on fibril surfaces throughout the fibre wall with enrichment on the outer fibre surface. Adsorption of GX before drying preserved a considerable part of the fibre-swelling (water retention value and fibre saturation point), specific fibre surface area, and wet fibre flexibility observed in the never-dried state. It is therefore suggested that GX adsorption reduces the degree of drying-induced fibre wall cross-linking.

The efficiency of degradation and {{the survival of}} strain JMP 134 and indigenous microorganisms in short-term batch or long-term semicontinuous incubations performed in microcosms were assessed. After 6 days of incubation, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetate (400 ppm) or 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (40 to 100 ppm) were extensively degraded (70 to 100 %). In short-term batch incubations, indigenous microorganisms were unable to degrade such of compounds. Degradation of 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol by strain JMP 134 was significantly lower at 200 to 400 ppm of compound. This strain was also able to degrade 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetate, 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol, 4 -chlorophenol, and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol when <b>bleached</b> <b>Kraft</b> mill effluent was amended with mixtures of these compounds.

Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) revealed a gradient of stations on both shorelines which was strongly correlated with distance from effluent outfall and hence exposure to the efflu-ent plume. Within this gradient were two distinct clusters of stations. The first cluster contained all but one station on both shores 90 %) by tubificids (Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Tubifex tubifex, T. ignotus and Spirosperma ferox) and the naidid Chaetogaster diaphanus. The second cluster contained all stations on both shores> 300 m from the outfall; community struc-ture at these stations was generally comparable to that at the reference site and was characterized by several species of Chironomidae, C. diaphanus and Nais barbata, and low numbers of several insect taxa. The results of this study show that benthic community structure in nearshore environments can be signifi-cantly impacted by pulp mill effluent and should be considered in monitoring assessments.
