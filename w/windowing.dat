5|$|Unlike Unix, Plan 9 was {{designed}} with graphics in mind. After booting, a Plan 9 terminal {{will run the}} rio <b>windowing</b> system, in which the user can create new windows displaying rc. Graphical programs invoked from this shell replace it in its window.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties. Examples include: <b>windowing</b> systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be {{represented as a}} set of files—could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs. The 9wm window manager was inspired by 8½, the older <b>windowing</b> system of Plan 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to being language-independent, OpenGL is also cross-platform. The specification says nothing {{on the subject of}} obtaining, and managing an OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying <b>windowing</b> system. For the same reason, OpenGL is purely concerned with rendering, providing no APIs related to input, audio, or <b>windowing.</b>|$|E
25|$|When an {{operating}} {{system with a}} native <b>windowing</b> system hosts X in addition, the X system can either use its own normal desktop in a separate host window or it can run rootless, meaning the X desktop is hidden and the host <b>windowing</b> environment manages the geometry and appearance of the hosted X windows within the host screen.|$|E

50|$|In the X <b>Window</b> System, every <b>window</b> has {{a parent}} <b>window,</b> {{which may be}} either the root <b>window</b> or another <b>window.</b> <b>Windows</b> that are {{children}} of the root <b>window</b> are called top-level <b>windows.</b> When a top-level <b>window</b> is created, a re-parenting <b>window</b> manager changes that <b>window's</b> parent to be a second new <b>window</b> created by the <b>window</b> manager for this purpose. This allows the <b>window</b> manager to decorate the <b>windows</b> with <b>window</b> decorations and title bars as well as allows advanced control over the windows' operation required, for example, by virtual <b>window</b> managers.|$|R

Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the pointing device. A window manager facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the <b>windowing</b> system.

25|$|OpenGL 3.0 {{introduced}} a deprecation mechanism to simplify future {{revisions of the}} API.

OpenGL 3.0 features could still be accessed alongside these deprecated features, however, by requesting a full context.|$|E

25|$|GUIs were a {{hot topic}} in the early 1980s. The Apple Lisa was {{released}} in 1983, and various <b>windowing</b> systems existed for DOS operating systems (including PC GEM and PC/GEOS).
