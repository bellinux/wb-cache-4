He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> What You Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E
500|$|Conspiracy Encyclopedia {{was listed}} as {{required}} reading in a 2008 course on conspiracy at Harvard University. Writing in Conspiracy Theories & Secret Societies For Dummies, authors Christopher Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon comment that Burnett asserts [...] "the spirit of our times has had the crap kicked out of it by global domination". The encyclopedia is recommended for further reading by David Southwell and Sean Twist in their book Unsolved Political Mysteries. Writing for The Star, James Mitchell observed, [...] "There's a huge amount packed in here, simply presented." [...] Mitchell concluded, [...] "Read the Conspiracy Encyclopedia, and you'll either have your worst fears confirmed that there's a grand, unified conspiracy affecting everything... or less exciting, {{that most of the}} time, vanilla rules: <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what you get!" ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 24, 2014, until October 8, 2014. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Glen Winter, and Arrows by Jesse Warn. The fight scene between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode was shot over three nights. Because {{this was the first}} time Stephen Amell's character fought someone with superpowers, he had to change the way he performed stunts to accommodate the special effects. Comparing the filming of both series, Grant Gustin described The Flash shooting as [...] "really tedious," [...] working with [...] "a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we are going to be in" [...] and later added in post-production, as opposed to Arrow where [...] "they shoot it from the perfect angles and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what you get". Gustin also recalled at times it got confusing on set because they were shooting both episodes at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Perry Como {{made the}} move to {{television}} when NBC initially televised the Chesterfield Supper Club radio program on December 24, 1948. A very special guest on that first television show was Como's eight-year-old son, Ronnie, {{as part of a}} boys' choir singing [...] "Silent Night" [...] with his father. The show was the usual Friday night Chesterfield Supper Club with an important exception—it was also being broadcast on television. The experimental simulcast was to continue for three Friday [...] "Supper Club" [...] shows, but had gone so well, NBC decided to extend the televised version through August 1949. Years later, Como admitted to being scared and feeling awkward initially, but somehow managed to just be himself. Said Como, [...] "You can't act on TV. With me, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what you get." [...] While still in its experimental phase, Como and the television show survived an on location broadcast in Durham, North Carolina, on April 15, 1949.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't {{have much in common}} with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

2500|$|Boam {{lived in}} the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Paula, a {{photographer}} and daughter of a Paramount Pictures vice president. They had three children, Tessa, Mia, and Dashiell. USA Today described Boam as [...] "low-key", and The New York Times called him [...] "a polite, soft-spoken family man {{without a trace of}} the frenzied energy of his films." [...] Film critic Christopher Hicks said that Boam could be unusually candid, but that [...] "Boam is simply Boam [...] a reclusive writer rather than a celebrity worried about his image. And <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> what you get, if perhaps a bit outspoken and opinionated." [...] He died on January 24, 2000.|$|E

The following year's Aretha album nearly matched this success with the hit singles [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash", [...] "Jimmy Lee" [...] and [...] "I Knew You Were Waiting for Me", her international number-one duet with George Michael. During that period, Franklin provided vocals to the theme songs of the shows, A Different World and Together. In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, which was recorded at her late father's New Bethel church, followed by Through the Storm in 1989. Franklin's 1991 album, <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>is</b> What You Sweat, flopped on the charts.

5000|$|Movement {{is another}} {{key element in}} Wilson's work. As a dancer, he sees the {{importance}} of the way an actor moves onstage and knows the weight their movement bears. When speaking of his [...] "play without words" [...] rendition of Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken, Wilson says:I do movement before we work on the text. Later we'll put text and movement together. I do movement first to make sure it's strong enough to stand on its own two feet without words. The movement must have a rhythm and structure of its own. It must not follow the text. It can reinforce a text without illustrating it. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> hear and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>are</b> two different layers.
