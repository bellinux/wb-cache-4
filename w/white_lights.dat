5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted nighttime photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> above their heads, and other small <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
40|$|Background: Bright light therapy, an {{effective}} therapeutic option for depressive adults, could provide safe, economic, and effective rapid recovery also in adolescents. Method: This was a randomized cross-over trial, i. e. that 14 patients received first dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> (50 lux) one {{hour a day}} for one week and then Bright light therapy (2500 Lux) for one week. 14 patients received first Bright light therapy and then dim <b>white</b> <b>light.</b> For assessment of depressive symptoms, Beck depression inventory scales were administered 1 week before and one day before dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, on the day between dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> and bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, {{on the day after}} bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment and one week after bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment. Saliva melatonin and cortisol samples were collected at 08 : 00 a. m. and 08 : 00 p. m., 1 week before and one day before dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, on the day between dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> and bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment, on the day after bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment and one week after bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> treatment and assayed for melatonin and cortisol to observe any change in circadian timing. Results: 28 volunteers, between 14 and 17 years old, completed the study. Beck depression inventory scores improved significantly. The assays of morning saliva melatonin showed significant differences between Bright <b>white</b> <b>light</b> and dim <b>white</b> <b>light</b> (p = 0. 005), those of evening saliva melatonin and saliva cortisol did not show significant differences. No significant adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion: Antidepressant response to bright light treatment in this age group was statistically superior to dim white ligh...|$|R

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, that <b>white</b> <b>lights,</b> such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding <b>white</b> <b>lights.</b> Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E

25|$|Signals, however, {{are used}} to give {{indications}} to tram drivers when running on-street and at street crossings. As trams have priority at many places, {{it was necessary to}} give them different traffic light phases from motor traffic and therefore different types of indication have to be used from those applicable to motor vehicles. Signal phases for the tramway are specifically modified to account for the length of the tram. The tram signals are usually operated alongside and in conjunction with traffic signals. Signals consist of <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> arranged vertically (for go), horizontally (for stop) and a cross (for caution). Two other light arrangement indicate a point direction at junctions. The five <b>white</b> <b>lights</b> are distinct from those of the standard road traffic lights or railway line-side signals.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of two photoreceptors regulating chloroplast orientation {{was found in}} the centric diatom Pleurosira laevis.

But it would have been impossible for him to have seen the flagman if the flagman had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to believe that an engineer of Jones' experience would have ignored a flagman and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.|$|E
