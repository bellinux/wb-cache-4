For welds made by the three <b>weld</b> <b>tools</b> under identical processing conditions, failure loads were approximately proportional to tool size.

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic welding is {{conducted}} using pure aluminum sheets to investigate {{effect of the}} transitional welding processes comprised of three transitional stages on {{the formation of the}} weld microstructure. In the first stage of ultrasonic welding, the relative motion mainly occurred between the workpieces, and a partially bonded region was observed in the weld interface. In the second stage, the relative motion at the weld interface was suppressed by the formation of the partially bonded region, while relative motion between the <b>weld</b> <b>tool</b> and the workpiece in contact with the <b>weld</b> <b>tool.</b> The relative motion at the weld tool/workpiece caused weld temperature rise with a penetration the <b>weld</b> <b>tool</b> edge. In the third stage, a plastic deformation zone generated by the relative motion at the weld tool/workpiece spread into the lower side of weld part as the welding time increased. It is proposed that the formation of weld microstructure in ultrasonic welding is attributed to the thermo-mechanically effect of the relative motion of the <b>weld</b> <b>tool</b> and workpiece...|$|R

The interaction of energetic electrons with metal produces x-rays. The radiation exposure to astronauts performing the in-vacuum {{electron beam}} welding must be characterized and minimized to insure safe operating conditions. This investigation characterized the x-ray environment due to operation of an in-vacuum electron beam <b>welding</b> <b>tool.</b> NASA, in {{a joint venture with}} the Russian Space Agency, was scheduled to perform a series of welding in space experiments on board the United States Space Shuttle. This series of experiments was named the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE). The hardware associated with the ISWE was leased to NASA, by the Paton Welding Institute (PWI) in Ukraine, for ground based welding experiments in preparation for flight. Two tests were scheduled, using the ISWE electron beam <b>welding</b> <b>tool,</b> to characterize the radiation exposure to an astronaut during the operation of the ISWE. These radiation exposure tests consisted of Thermoluminescence Dosimeters (TLD's) shielded with material currently used by astronauts during Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) and exposed to x-ray radiation generated by operation of an in-vacuum electron beam <b>welding</b> <b>tool.</b> This investigation was the first known application of TLD's to measure absorbed dose from x-rays of energy less than 10 KeV. The ISWE hardware was returned to Ukraine before the issue of adequate shielding for the astronauts was verified. Therefore, alternate experimental and analytical methods were developed to measure and predict the x-ray spectral and intensity distribution generated by electron impact with metal. These x-ray spectra were used to calculate the absorbed radiation dose to astronauts.

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating <b>weld</b> pin <b>tool</b> that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the <b>weld</b> pin <b>tool</b> against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the <b>weld</b> pin <b>tool</b> by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed.
