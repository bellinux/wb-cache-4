5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{necessary}} condition for the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> concentration to occur is an unequal initial distribution <b>of</b> <b>wealth.</b> The distribution <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> throughout the population is often closely approximated by a Pareto distribution, with tails which decay as a power-law in wealth.

Using SHARE data, our analyses suggest (1) that there is strong variation in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> between European countries, and (2) that patterns <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> inequality differ strongly from patterns of income inequality. Surprisingly high levels <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> disparity were found in the social democratic welfare regimes commonly known as very egalitarian societies. We conclude that Esping-Andersen’s scheme requires reconsideration because it is based on a one-sided understanding of social stratiﬁcation not accounting for the central role <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> in the stratiﬁcation process. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{begins by}} noting the {{scarcity}} {{of information on the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> in Australia, and the many reasons for wanting to have such information. The potential role of the tax system in affecting the composition <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> is noted, and the taxation of savings is briefly described. A number of different methods of estimating the distribution <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> are discussed. Estimates for the distribution and composition <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> in Australia in 1986 are derived from the 1986 Income Distribution Survey, which suggest that the wealthiest ten per cent of income units hold 55 per cent <b>of</b> total <b>wealth.</b> The composition <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> is broadly consistent with the expected impact of the tax system.
