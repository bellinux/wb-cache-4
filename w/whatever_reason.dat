5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E
5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> {{his or her}} seat will be filled by a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, {{will be replaced by}} a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.|$|E

5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E

5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|For <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> Ealdred {{gave up the}} see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates {{arrived in}} England to hold a council {{and make sure that}} Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This {{happened}} at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed Urse d'Abetot's attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for <b>whatever</b> <b>reason,</b> that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
