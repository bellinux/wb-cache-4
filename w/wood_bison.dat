25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, only 300 <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> {{remained}} worldwide, {{almost exclusively in}} Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6000-7000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis, which infected the <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus {{it was thought that}} <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a disease-free, <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> remaining. In 2007, the <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{majority}} of the world's <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> herds are located in Northern Canada: a small herd of bison discovered {{in the northern part of}} Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and 300 remain there today as the most genetically pure <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> remaining. While there are many factors that have contributed to the decline of the <b>wood</b> <b>bison,</b> the most prominent are the over-hunting that took place in the 1800s, inadequate conservation methods that led to hybridization with the plains bison and other species, and the spread of communicable diseases. <b>Wood</b> <b>bison</b> were largely over-hunted in the 1800s, and only a few hundred remained in Northern Alberta by early 20th century. By 1957, <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> were thought to have been finally extinct in Canada due to hybridization with the plains bison, which took place in Wood Buffalo National Park between 1925 and 1928. As <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> species became threatened with the hybridization, relocation and breeding conservation programs specific to <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> were established in 1963, and the population increased steadily. From the 1970s to the 90s, however, the population began to decline again with the spread of bovine tuberculosis which resulted from the transfer of infected plains bison to Wood Buffalo National Park. In the case of Wood Buffalo National Park, the number of <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> declined from 10,000 bison in the late 1960s to 2,200 bison by the late 1990s due to this process. The story of the <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> in North America is largely one of repeated human mistakes that resulted in critical endagerment of an iconic species.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, Buffalo National Park in Alberta was {{established}} with {{a herd of}} 300 plains bison. By 1916 more than 2,000 bison lived in the park, which was now overpopulated. As a result, many were moved to Wood Buffalo National Park in north-eastern Alberta (est. 1922). There, the plains bison and <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> mingled and created a hybridized species of bison. The plains bison also brought new diseases which infected the existing <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> population.|$|E

25|$|The park is {{representative}} of the northern prairies plateau ecosystem and as such, the knob and kettle landscape is a mix of native fescue grassland, aspen parkland and boreal forest. As well, Elk Island plays host to both the largest and the smallest terrestrial mammals in North America, the <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> and pygmy shrew respectively.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{are found}} in every area of Utah. Non-predatory larger mammals include the <b>wood</b> <b>bison,</b> elk, moose, {{mountain}} goat, mule deer, pronghorn, and multiple types of bighorn sheep. Non-predatory small mammals include muskrat, and nutria. Predatory mammals include the brown and black bear, cougar, Canada lynx, bobcat, fox (gray, red, and kit), coyote, badger, gray wolf, black-footed ferret, mink, stoat, long-tailed weasel, raccoon, and otter.|$|E
25|$|In some {{particular}} circumstances the government considers agricultural land to be equivalent to forest land. Oil sands companies have reclaimed mined land {{to use as}} pasture for <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> instead of restoring it to the original boreal forest and muskeg. Syncrude asserts they have reclaimed 22% of their disturbed land, a figure disputed by other sources, who assess Syncrude more accurately reclaimed only 0.2% of its disturbed land.|$|E

25|$|True to its roots, Elk Island National Park still {{maintains}} a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, {{as well as}} around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1949. Reintroduction of traditional species {{has been an important}} focus as well. Besides the success of the <b>wood</b> and plains <b>bison</b> introduction, beaver were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a Trumpeter Swan reintroduction programme which is now seeing mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of high throughput sequencing (HTS) in 2005 caused {{a revolution in}} the field of ancient DNA (aDNA). Using the large sequencing capacity of HTS, researchers have overcome the abundant environmental contamination present in most aDNA extractions to reconstruct the genomes of long extinct organisms, such as an archaic horse that perished > 500, 000 years ago. The proliferation of genomes engendered by HTS has also {{led to the development of}} potential ancillary technologies for aDNA research such as genotyping microarrays. In this thesis, HTS and genotyping techniques were developed or refined to improve the application of aDNA to larger biological questions in evolution. This thesis successfully: a) describes an in-house hybridization capture system that uses RNA probes generated from long-range PCR amplicons, b) demonstrates that recombinase polymerase amplification is a less biased alternative to PCR in hybridization capture of aDNA, c) develops an analytical approach that improves phylogenies generated with data from the Illumina BovineSNP 50 BeadChip (a commercially available genotyping microarray). In contrast, an attempt to determine the identity of modified nucleotides in aDNA with Pacific Bioscience’s Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing prove to be unsuccessful and genotyping of ancient bison aDNA with the BovineSNP 50 BeadChip generated inconsistent results. Furthermore, a hybridization capture probe design was tested and found to be unsuitable for aDNA enrichment. For the larger biological aspect of this thesis, several of the methods developed were used to study bison, because these animals are ideal models of megafauna evolution. Using the in-house hybridization capture system, whole mitochondrial genomes were enriched from aDNA and used to help identify a new extinct species of bison. Furthermore, the new analytical approach for BovineSNP 50 BeadChip data was used to demonstrate a significant genetic split between American <b>woods</b> and plains <b>bison,</b> which supports separating these animals at least at the subspecies level. This genetic split suggests that <b>woods</b> and plains <b>bison</b> should be conserved as separate species, which has considerable economic and political implications. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|The {{preservation}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> in northern Canada was implied by the strict federal control of traditional Aboriginal hunting practices {{through the creation of}} a wildlife sanctuary. The federal government proposed large scale ranching and breeding plans for bison herds. Preservationist approaches to the bison in the north implied the assertion of federal power over the bison which had been under the control of Aboriginal hunters for generations. There was no role for the human use of nature.|$|E
25|$|Elk Island National Park also {{remains a}} seed herd for {{repopulation}} efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and {{the foothills of}} the Rockies. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> were relocated to the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the area}} is {{occupied}} by pine forests and swamps, and {{some parts of the}} Naliboki are rather hilly. Rich fauna include deer, wild boars, elks, beavers, bears, <b>bison,</b> <b>wood</b> grouses, heath cocks, snipes etc. From the 10th to the 11th century, although very scarcely populated, the big forest on the right bank of upper River Neman was strategically important for the pagan Lithuanian tribes. The important Ruthenian towns Minsk and Zaslawye were founded {{on the edge of the}} forest as fortresses to defend the Ruthenian frontier against Lithuanian forays. In the middle of the 13th century, the forest defended the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the south from the attacks of the Golden Horde and its vassal, the principality of Halych-Volhynia, thus helping the newly formed state to survive. The border between Ruthenia (which remained under Tartar power) and Lithuania that was established as a result of this clash, left traces in the local legends about the battles with Tartars at Mahilna and Koydanava and predetermined the long lasting division of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to Lithuania proper and “Lithuanian Russia”. As a result of the Union of Krewo (1385) and subsequent Christianization of Lithuania in 1387, local pagans were converted to Catholicism, and the area stayed predominantly Catholic until today. The long-term clash of Russian Orthodox and Polish-Lithuanian Catholic identities in the Naliboki Forest lasted until recent times, as exemplified in such prominent 20th century figures as Felix Dzerzhinsky, or many heroes of Catholic resistance both to Nazi and Soviet regimes.|$|R
25|$|Early {{conservation}} efforts {{to preserve the}} iconic bison were ultimately undermined by the federal government's goal of domesticating northern bison populations for commercial purposes. The utilitarian, scientific approach to bison management prevented the state from comprehending the complexity of local ecosystems and human cultures. The narrow focus on production resulted in poor federal wildlife management decisions, such as the transfer of thousands of plains bison from the overpopulated range in Buffalo National Park to the supposedly understocked range in Wood Buffalo National. The transfer had disastrous ecological consequences, including hybridization between the plains and <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> species and the infection of the northern herds with tuberculosis and brucellosis.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the plains}} bison and <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> populations were hunted by nomadic {{indigenous}} hunters and white hunters alike. By the 1850s, the bison was nearly extinct, spurring {{a movement to}} save the few herds that remained. Federal government wildlife policy evolved from preservation of wilderness to utilitarian, scientific conservation and management of bison populations. The goals of these policies often contradicted themselves, aiming to simultaneously preserve wildlife, promote recreation, commercialize the bison, and assert state control over Aboriginal peoples. Bison conservation efforts were shaped by the federal government's colonialist and modernist approach to Canada's north, the management of national parks and reserves, {{and the influence of}} scientific knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|A {{separate}} {{study by}} Wilson and Strobeck, published in Genome, {{was done to}} define the relationships between different herds of bison in the United States and Canada, and {{to determine whether the}} bison at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and the Yellowstone Park bison herd were possibly separate subspecies, and not Plains bison. Some people had suggested that the Yellowstone Park bison were actually either of the B. b. athabascae (wood buffalo) subspecies, or else that they were of an unspecified 'mountain' subspecies. In the study, it was determined that the wood buffalo park bison were actually cross breeds between plains bison and <b>wood</b> <b>bison,</b> but that their predominant genetic makeup was in fact that of the expected [...] "wood buffalo" [...] (B. b. athabascae).

2500|$|Wood Buffalo National Park, {{established}} in 1922 in northeastern Alberta {{and the southern}} portion of The Northwest Territories, is North America's largest national park, at 44,800 km2. [...] It served to protect herds of bison that had dropped in numbers from an estimated 40 million in 1830 to less than 1000 by 1900. [...] Despite harboring bovine diseases such as tuberculosis and brucellosis, the introduced and resident population increased to somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 by 1934. [...] The bison population reached 12,500 to 15,000 by the late 1940s and early 1950s but by 1998, Parks Canada documented that the population had decreased to approximately 2,300. [...] This decline was due to {{various factors such as}} slaughters, cessation of wolf poisoning, round-ups for disease control, floods, diseases, predation, and habitat changes. [...] These significant declines, as well as the elimination of existing pure strain bison caused major political debate on the future of bison in the park and the presence of contagious bovine diseases. In August 1990, a review panel supported by the federal government recommended the introduction of disease-free <b>wood</b> <b>bison</b> from Elk Island National Park and potentially elsewhere, but due to a quick and negative public response, no action was taken. [...] From 1996 to 2001, a 5-year Bison Research and Containment Program (BRCP) was conducted to assess the prevalence and impact of brucellosis and tuberculosis on the bison population of Wood Buffalo National Park. To understand the changing dynamics of this particular ecosystem, multiple research studies continue to this day.|$|E
