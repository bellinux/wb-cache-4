5|$|In the Third Round, Queens Park Rangers of the Third Division South {{were beaten}} 1–0 at Loftus Road.

5|$|Among the German claimants was Helmut Lent who was {{credited}} with two victories. After landing at Jever from a patrol, Lent took off to intercept. He engaged Herbie Ruse's Wellington, killing most of the crew. The Wellington <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> black smoke, and Lent broke off believing it about to crash. Lent then pursued Officer Thompson's Wellington, which crashed just {{off the coast of}} Borkum. Lent's third claim was not granted: he attacked and downed Flying Officer Wimberley's aircraft, but because the aircraft was already badly damaged and judged to be about to crash, Lent was refused the victory. Instead, Stab./JG 1's Geschwaderkommodore Schumacher was given the credit. Schumacher also shot down Pilot Officer Lewis's aircraft, close to Borkum. At 13:45, the German fighters—at the limit of their endurance—returned to base. By 14:05, the other bomber formation was beyond interception range and the last shots were fired.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter Steel Company, Inc. was {{incorporated}} on June 7, 1889, and Carpenter became its general manager. He leased the defunct Philadelphia and Reading rail mill in Reading, and eleven weeks later he <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> steel for tools. Within a short time, 3,000 tons of steel had been produced {{and the company}} was receiving orders that exceeded {{the capacity of the}} mill. In November Carpenter acquired the nearby Union Foundry, which he modernized and expanded. The old Union Foundry is now the headquarters of the Carpenter Technology Corporation and is a specialty steel producer.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E
25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's eyebrow and nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not in line of sight to see this. Blood <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor examined it. A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with blood in his eyes {{for the rest of the}} fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as commanding officer of the 3d Assault Battalion Landing Team, 25th Marines, 4th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, from 19 to 22 February 1945. Under a furious barrage of enemy machinegun and small-arms fire from the commanding cliffs on the right, Col. Chambers (then Lt. Col.) landed immediately after the initial assault waves of his battalion on D-day to find the momentum of the assault threatened by heavy casualties from withering Japanese artillery, mortar rocket, machinegun, and rifle fire. Exposed to relentless hostile fire, he coolly reorganized his battle-weary men, inspiring them to heroic efforts by his own valor and leading them in an attack on the critical, impregnable high ground from which the enemy <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> an increasing volume of fire directly onto troops ashore as well as amphibious craft in succeeding waves. Constantly in the front lines encouraging his men to push forward against the enemy's savage resistance, Col. Chambers led the 8-hour battle to carry the flanking ridge top and reduce the enemy's fields of aimed fire, thus protecting the vital foothold gained. In constant defiance of hostile fire while reconnoitering the entire regimental combat team zone of action, he maintained contact with adjacent units and forwarded vital information to the regimental commander. His zealous fighting spirit undiminished despite terrific casualties and the loss of most of his key officers, he again reorganized his troops for renewed attack against the enemy's main line of resistance and was directing the fire of the rocket platoon when he fell, critically wounded. Evacuated under heavy Japanese fire, Col. Chambers, by forceful leadership, courage, and fortitude in the face of staggering odds, was directly instrumental in insuring the success of subsequent operations of the 5th Amphibious Corps on Iwo Jima, thereby sustaining and enhancing the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E

2500|$|Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, {{first tried}} to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's {{immediate}} recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> from his neck: [...] "There {{is no way}} to pay back the emperor's favor. I deserve death with my crime". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless. Sorting out the Mien (the Chinese word for [...] "Burmese") was now a matter of imperial prestige. The Emperor now appointed Yang Yingju, an experienced frontier officer with long service in Xinjiang and Guangzhou.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen.

2500|$|Following Brian's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests were asked a series of {{questions}} about which of two HouseGuests would adhere to certain situations. The object was not to base the answer on personal opinions, but how they thought the majority would answer. The minority of the voters were eliminated each round; if there was a tie, none of the HouseGuests would be eliminated. Jessie was the winner. Jessie expressed interest in nominating Renny that week, however, {{the other members of the}} eight person alliance pressured him to nominate Dan and Steven due to their close friendship with Brian. On Day 10, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Stop Your Wining!" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests split into two teams and were required to fill up wine bottles from wine that <b>was</b> <b>pouring</b> out from barrels suspended in the air; the team with the most wine in their bottles at the end would be the winners. The team of April, Jerry, Keesha, Libra, Memphis, and Renny were the losing team, thus were placed on the slop diet for the week. Later that day, Jessie chose to nominate Dan and Steven for eviction, with Steven being his main target. Realizing that the alliance of eight would soon fall apart, Angie, Jessie, Memphis, and Michelle formed an alliance outside of the group. The other members of the alliance of eight began to fear that Keesha would use the Power of Veto to save Steven, due to their friendship; Keesha later told Steven that she would use the Power of Veto to remove him from the block. On Day 11, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "License to Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were shown various license plates with portions of a phrase on them, and had to determine which three plates made up a specific Big Brother phrase. If a HouseGuests answered incorrectly, they were eliminated; the last remaining HouseGuest would be the winner. Michelle was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following this, Steven attempted to convince Jessie and Michelle to use the Power of Veto and backdoor Libra that week, a plan which they initially were receptive to. On Day 13, however, Michelle chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. On Day 16, Steven became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of nine to zero.|$|E
