[...] "It wasn't until our first family trip together that this very visceral emotional landscape of my past, that I had by now nearly all but forgotten, hit me again like [...] bullet." [...] On the family's first trip to Walt Disney World, the emotions grew stronger. [...] "t <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was there as a ghost. We were going on the same rides I used {{to go on with}} him, but now we're no longer talking anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|A tour of a {{few months}} in Charlie Spivak's band in 1953 preceded Marmarosa being drafted into the army the {{following}} year. This exacerbated his problems: several months in a Veteran Administration hospital preceded his discharge, at which point he was in a poor psychological condition. Back in Pittsburgh, where he played locally from March 1956, Marmarosa continued to be erratic, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time, and giving his money away: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was on the road to self-destruction", commented trumpeter Danny Conn. Amateur recordings from the pianist's concerts in Pittsburgh in 1958 were released four decades later by Uptown Records.|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{accepted}} the role because she likes cartoons {{and was a}} fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, [...] "This is me." [...] He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi: [...] "My first cartoon, I had {{to be carried out}} crying It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'" [...] Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a [...] "phone": [...] "I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in another booth in the studio." ...|$|E
5000|$|Owen also {{references}} Monty Python when {{he tells}} Martha what death <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> tells her [...] "the man at the pearly gates" [...] said to him, [...] "You're a very naughty boy," [...] which is a line from Monty Python's Life of Brian.|$|R

500|$|In 1972, Jerry Claiborne {{took over}} as {{head coach of the}} Terrapins, which had only nine wins in the past five years. In his first season, Maryland {{improved}} to 5–5–1, and the following year, they reached their first bowl game in almost two decades. The team steadily improved until his fifth season, 1976, when they finished the regular season with an 11–0 record, their first perfect mark since Tatum's 1955 squad. Boomer Esiason later described Claiborne's coaching style as [...] "vanilla", and said his strategy was [...] "run right, run left, run up the middle, punt, and play good defense." [...] He went on to say, [...] "But, there's no question he made me a tougher player [...] [...] [...] We'd do drills where the quarterback had to take on a linebacker. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had a sign on our back, 'Hit us, we're stupid'. It made you a tougher player." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1946, Alf visited Mimi's {{house at}} 251 Menlove Avenue {{and took his}} son to Blackpool for a long 'holiday'—but {{secretly}} intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool, and after a heated argument Alf made the five-year-old boy choose between Julia or him. John chose Alf (twice) and then Julia walked away, {{but in the end}} John, crying, followed her, although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and John met again. In 1968, John Lennon told Hunter Davies that he soon forgot his father, saying, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was dead." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the episodes [...] "Basketball" [...] and [...] "The Dundies". [...] "The Client" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who acts on the show as human resources director Toby Flenderson. The idea for Jan and Michael to have a romantic relationship was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. According to writer and producer Greg Daniels [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> (Michael) was turned on by his teacher." [...] Writer and actor Paul Lieberstein said that the first idea that anybody came up for the episode was the final shot, where Jim and Michael look at each other and shake their heads, suggesting that they had been through similar experiences. The rest of the episode was written to lead to that scene. The scene where Oscar tells a story about a date getting a background check on him was based on an actual date that Paul Lieberstein went on.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, when Bowles {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what his social life <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> replied, [...] "I don't know what a social life is...

5000|$|... 'The Wanderers' {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Conor Tannam best sums it up: [...] "...The {{language is}} direct and steers clear of grandiose statements. Price writes about these adolescents <b>like</b> <b>he</b> knows where they’ve <b>been,</b> <b>like</b> <b>he’s</b> just {{stepped out of}} the places and potholes of their childhood. And although his primary focus is on ‘The Wanderers’, the eponymous youth gang, his peripheral vision is so sharp it allows him to cast a critical eye over the greater American urban landscape.|$|R
2500|$|From mid-1996 Skunkhour {{created a}} new sound, abandoning spoken-word content and {{focusing}} more on melody. Aya described the re-defining moment when Dean provided the bass guitar for [...] "Foam": [...] "It really turned things around. That bassline is just out of control, and I was like, 'God, I {{want to get on}} this'. When Deano pulled out that bassline it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was leading us into battle." [...] By that time Chris Simms had been added to live gigs as a percussionist. Their third album, Chin Chin, which was co-produced by the group with Magoo (Regurgitator), was preceded by its lead single, [...] "Breathing Through My Eyes" [...] in April. Chin Chin was released in July 1997 to critical acclaim and peaked at No.34. The Sun-Heralds Peter Holmes described it as [...] "a massive leap forward" [...] from the [...] "cliched, choppy funk material" [...] of their first two albums, concluding: [...] "Skunkhour's overall feel is heavier, the grooves are deeper and the arrangements a little rockier".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe the}} police covered up what happened. On January 1, Liston's wife called Johnny Tocco {{and said she}} hadn't heard from her husband in three days and was worried. A few years before Tocco died, he {{allegedly}} told his good friend, Tony Davi, {{that he went to}} Liston's house and found the door locked and his car in the driveway. Tocco called the police, and they broke into the house. Tocco said that the living room furniture was in disarray, but the house did not yet smell of death. He said they found Sonny lying on his bed with a needle sticking out of his arm. Johnny left the house before the police did. [...] "Johnny wasn't a braggart," [...] Davi told Liston biographer Paul Gallender. [...] "He told me in the strictest confidence, but it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> wanted to get it off his chest." [...] Gallender claims, [...] "A lot of officers knew Sonny was dead before Geraldine returned home on January 5, but they chose to let him rot." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>he</b> totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} has made numerous brief {{returns to the}} serial as a guest character. In 1993, she was featured in a special week of episodes, filmed on-location in Paris, France, where Frank discovered, to his horror, that Diane was pregnant with an unknown foreign man's baby. In June 1994, Diane returned to Walford {{as part of a}} storyline involving her father's disappearance. In 1997, another week's worth of episodes set in Paris reunited Ricky and Diane. Shortly after, the character returned to the soap's setting of Walford, but Lawrence reportedly quit weeks after making her comeback. She had since commented on her reasons for quitting so soon: [...] "Going back to EastEnders was like going back to school and none of your friends are there. I was [...] there with people like Nick Berry (Simon Wicks) and Letitia Dean (Sharon Watts) and they'd all gone. One of the young actors, who will remain nameless, made me a coffee and started telling me all about what it <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> had no idea I'd been in the soap before." [...] In addition, Lawrence was suffering physically as she was still getting over injuries she sustained from a car accident and was forced to remove a neck brace for filming purposes. On-screen, the character departed to travel with her musician boyfriend, abandoning her young son in her brother's care. Bosses at EastEnders had reportedly been keen for Lawrence to remain on the show, as they were hoping for an on-screen reunion of the Butcher family; Mike Reid had agreed to reprise his role as Frank, though Diane departed before his reintroduction.|$|E
