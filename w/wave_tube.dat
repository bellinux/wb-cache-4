5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling <b>wave</b> <b>tube</b> (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
25|$|Traveling <b>wave</b> <b>tube</b> {{amplifiers}} (TWTAs) {{are used}} for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across {{a broad spectrum of}} frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons.|$|E
2500|$|Vacuum-tube {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling <b>wave</b> <b>tube,</b> and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|E

These applications require high signal quality. The optimization of the amplifier characteristics enables the ideal use of available power and leads to energy savings of up to 50%.|$|R
50|$|Another {{change from}} {{existing}} satellites is using solid-state transmitters {{rather than the}} traveling <b>wave</b> <b>tubes</b> used in most high-power military SHF/EHF applications.

50|$|Three {{modes of}} {{propagation}} could be used; Tropospheric scatter, Obstacle Gain Diffraction, and line-of-sight. Tropospheric Scatter and Obstacle Gain Diffraction typically used the 1 kW klystron while the line-of-sight mode used the 1W Traveling <b>Wave</b> <b>Tube</b> (TWT).

40|$|THz {{applications}} require {{sources and}} amplifiers compact, lightweight and powerful. Vacuum electron devices are the candidate solution. Among others, the Corrugated Waveguide Slow-Wave Structure seems particularly suitable for Traveling <b>Wave</b> <b>Tubes</b> in the THz region. THz vacuum electron devices require high precision technological processes with high aspect ratio such as SU- 8 process. However, fabrication tolerances could highly affect the overall performances.

40|$|Conventional crosswell {{surveys are}} {{expensive}} because a source {{must be placed}} downhole, {{which means that the}} hole must be prepped and placed o-line for a number of days. We suggest an interesting but unproven alternative: place a source on the surface, drop a simple obstruction-like device downhole that scatters <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> arrivals from the surface source, and use the scattered <b>tube</b> <b>waves</b> energy as a seismic source in that borehole. We test this idea by computing the <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> responses from a synthetic crosswell data set and use these tube-wave responses to construct a well-resolved velocity image between the wells. The <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> responses are also computed from eld data recorded with a conventional crosswell survey. The processing method is based on stacking of coherent seismic energy that emanates from the location of <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> scattering. Results show that the arrival time of both the transmitted arrivals and reflection events in the <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> responses agree well with those in the real common shot gathers. However, there are fewer reflection events in the <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> responses than in the conventional shot gathers and their bandwidth is not as wide. Nevertheless, this result suggests the possibility that more economical crosswell seismic surveys can be performed using surface seismic sources and <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> scatterers in the source well. The remaining {{question is whether or not}} the <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> scatterer is strong enough to generate reflections with a suciently high signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

At low frequency the excited <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> {{is found to be}} independent of the borehole radius and shows stronger sensitivity to the formation shear velocity contrast across the layer boundary. The sensitivity towards the compressional velocity perturbation is opposite to that of the shear wave and density such that little <b>tube</b> <b>wave</b> can be generated if the compressional and shear velocities are both increased or decreased accordingly.
