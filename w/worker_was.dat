5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> still able to forage with little trouble.|$|E
5|$|Life {{during the}} {{pipeline}} construction project {{was characterized by}} long hours, poor conditions, and limited entertainment compensated by excellent benefits and pay. Each <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> handed a small booklet of 23 camp rules, but the rules (including no alcohol or smoking) were frequently broken and became the target of ribald humor.|$|E
5|$|By his own {{description}} of his early family life, Cody grew up poor. His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care {{for him and his}} seven younger siblings. His parents were not married, but his father, a construction <b>worker,</b> <b>was</b> a big part of his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate.|$|E

5|$|Crop {{damage was}} worst along the Indian River Lagoon; several farms in Stuart {{experienced}} total losses, and statewide, 16% of the citrus crop, or 4million boxes, were destroyed. Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, {{and the local}} chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown. Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465houses and destroyed another 383, causing over $3million in damage. One person, an African American farm <b>worker,</b> <b>was</b> killed when his shack blew down in Gomez, a brakeman died after sevenrailcars derailed, and a child was killed by airborne debris.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains brought {{flooding}} to Oaxaca {{that killed}} two people; a nine-year old was swept {{away in a}} river and a company <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> struck by lightning. Due {{to a combination of}} high waves and storm surge, 69buildings in Acapulco sustained damage, including 18restaurants and a portion of a scenic walkway. Along the beaches of Nayarit and Colima, minor damage was reported. On the beach in Puerto Vallarta, two people were killed due to high waves.|$|E
5|$|November 1917 saw {{the second}} {{turning point in}} the 1917–1918 rivalry for the {{leadership}} of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, polarization between the Social Democrats and Conservatives increased dramatically, including political violence. An agricultural <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> shot during a local strike on 9 August at Ypäjä and a Civil Guard member was killed in aftermath of local political crisis at Malmi on 24 September 1917.|$|E

30|$|Before 1978, the {{construction}} industry used the relative easy production methods with brick and concrete structures, combining semi-industrial and on-site prefabrication. Enterprises <b>were</b> state-owned. <b>Workers</b> <b>were</b> both fixed and temporary workers. The fixed <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> the major part of {{the construction}} industry (Qi, 2011). Temporary <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> recruited from rural masons, carpenters and stunners, usually for tasks.|$|R
5|$|On Saturday night, May 15, the {{observation}} posts reported many vehicles with full lights moving along the Golan ridge {{east of the}} Sea of Galilee. The opening shots were fired by Syrian artillery on kibbutz Ein Gev at approximately 01:00 on May 16. At dawn, Syrian aircraft attacked the Kinarot valley villages. The following day, a Syrian company which split from the main force attacked the water station with heavy weaponry, where every <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> killed except one.|$|E
5|$|As with {{at least}} 4% of Méliès's output (including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies, The Impossible Voyage, and The Barber of Seville), some prints of A Trip to the Moon were {{individually}} hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French <b>worker,</b> <b>was</b> killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get out in time.|$|E
50|$|Workers {{and major}} <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> mostly {{coloured}} orange. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> 5 - 6 mm long; they look after larvae and farm scale bugs for honeydew. Major <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> 8 - 10 mm long, with long strong legs and large mandibles. They forage, assemble {{and expand the}} nest. Queens are typically 20 - 25 mm long, and normally greenish-brown.|$|R

5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather <b>worker,</b> <b>was</b> the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
5|$|Arlene brought strong {{thunderstorms}} and showers to much {{of eastern}} Mexico, with gale-force winds along adjacent coastlines. Upon landfall in Veracruz, Arlene produced wind speeds to 60mph (100km/h) and up to 9.11in (231.5mm) of rainfall. The winds and rain uprooted trees and caused extensive flooding, prompting at least 1,786 people throughout the state to evacuate their homes. A total of 67 landslides {{took place in the}} state; one such landslide collapsed two houses in Tlalnelhuayocan, killing one inhabitant and injuring 10others. Mudslides and rockfall also uprooted trees and damaged eight cars in Banerilla, though no injuries were linked to the incident. In Tihuatlán, a rescue <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> killed during the passage of the storm. Overall, Arlene affected 3,358residences across 50municipalities in Veracruz; about 2,000homes were damaged in El Higo. Continued downpours brought on the overflow of 28rivers, as well as the isolation of 116communities statewide. Other effects in Veracruz included considerable infrastructural failure, localized land subsidence, and three damaged schools in Coacoatzintla. The costs of road reconstructions totaled Mex$126million (US$10.2million). In response to the devastation, the government {{declared a state of emergency}} for 65percent of the state; by July5, 62municipalities remained under alert.|$|E
5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E

5000|$|Wages: In capitalism, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> rewarded {{according}} to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> paid for precisely {{the value of their}} services. In reality, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer. In this sense, all paid employment is exploitation and the <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> [...] "alienated" [...] from their work. Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it <b>is</b> impossible for <b>workers</b> to <b>be</b> paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.|$|R
50|$|More than 300,000 {{plantation}} <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> {{employed in}} Bangladeshi tea gardens. 75% of <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> women. Many are descendants of tribal labourers brought from central India by the British.|$|R
5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|On 23 January the RIRA {{attacked}} Ebrington Army Barracks in Derry for {{a second}} time, firing a mortar over a perimeter fence. A mortar {{similar to the one}} used in the attack was found by Gardaí near Newtowncunningham on 13 February, and British army bomb disposal experts made safe another mortar found between Dungannon and Carrickmore on 12 April. On 1 August a 40lb bomb was discovered in a car at the long-stay car park of Belfast International Airport following a telephone warning, and was made safe with two controlled explosions by bomb disposal experts. In December a six-day security operation ended when a 70lb bomb found under railway tracks at Killeen Bridge near Newry was defused. The operation began following telephone warnings, and the road and railway line connecting Newry to Dundalk were closed due to security alerts. A pipe bomb was discovered at a police officer's home in Annalong, County Down on 3 January 2002, and two teenage boys were injured in County Armagh on 2 March when a bomb hidden in a traffic cone exploded. On 29 March 2002 the RIRA targeted {{a former member of the}} Royal Irish Regiment from Sion Mills, County Tyrone, with a bomb attached to his car that failed to explode. On 1 August 2002 a civilian <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> killed by an explosion at a Territorial Army base in Derry. The man, a 51-year-old former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, was the thirtieth person killed by the RIRA.|$|E

25|$|On 25 August a French aid <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> kidnapped in Chad. The {{kidnapping}} of foreigners along the Chad/Darfur border became more frequent in 2009. A French NGO <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> taken and then murdered on 29 October 2009, and an unidentified Red Cross <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> captured on 10 November 2009. Many NGOs and charities {{have begun to}} restrict the areas covered by their aid work in Niger, Chad, and Sudan due to the ever-present risk of bandits and kidnappers. The organizations are thus pulling out in fear of their workers' lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} ground breaking {{ceremony was}} held June 16, 1961 at {{the construction site}} of the new NORAD Combat Operations Center. Generals Lee (ADC) and Laurence S. Kuter (NORAD) simultaneously set off symbolic dynamite charges. On December 20, 1961, with excavation 53% complete there were 200 workers that walked off on what Cecil Welton, Utah Construction Company project manager, called a wildcat strike after a <b>worker</b> <b>was</b> fired for disobeying safety rules.

50|$|The Trades Union Congress (TUC) {{report on}} {{vulnerable}} <b>workers</b> http://www.vulnerableworkers.org.uk/files/CoVE_full_report.pdf <b>was</b> critical that the Authority's narrow scope failed {{to extend its}} regime for gangmasters to sectors such as construction, hospitality, and care home <b>workers.</b> It <b>was</b> estimated that at least 2 million <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> left out while UCATT, the building workers union, estimating that East European <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> paid as low as £8.80 for a 39-hour week.|$|R
50|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> more {{related to}} their own sons than to the queen's sons. However, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> more related to the queen's sons than sons of other <b>workers.</b> This <b>is</b> because swarm-founding colonies are {{typically}} large and have multiple queens, making workers more related to queens than other workers. Because {{of the difference in}} degree of relatedness, a <b>worker</b> would <b>be</b> more inclined to care for the queen’s sons than to a son of another worker. Worker policing effectively preserves the collective interests of the colony by controlling the production of males within a colony and limiting male production to only the queen. Another situation of <b>worker</b> policing <b>is</b> found in cyclical oligogyny, where males are only produced when there are multiple queens in the colony and <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> equally related to males and females. Workers typically participate in worker policing when the degree of relatedness between <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> relatively low.|$|R
