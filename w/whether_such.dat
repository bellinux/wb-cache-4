5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|Although A Company, 1 RAR {{had been}} mauled, the {{experience}} of the Australians at Gang Toi was relatively minor when compared to that of the Americans. During fierce fighting the US 1/503rd Battalion had suffered 40 killed and 51 wounded, while more than 400 Viet Cong were believed killed. American claims were later raised to over 700 killed when captured documents revealed the losses caused by artillery and air strikes. Yet it was questionable as to <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> battles of attrition would be viable, while equally the American battalion had taken casualties far beyond what would have been politically acceptable for 1 RAR. Indeed, their losses had been significant, and although claimed as a victory, the Americans had failed to secure the area even if the Viet Cong had temporarily surrendered control of the battlefield. Ultimately, the communists continued to use the Bien Hoa area as a major supply route {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Argentina {{approached}} the UK {{with a proposal}} to buy a number of Vulcans. An application, made in September 1981, requested the 'early availability' of a 'suitable aircraft'. With some reluctance, ministers approved the export of a single aircraft but emphasised that clearance had not been given {{for the sale of}} a larger number. A letter from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ministry of Defence in January 1982 stated that little prospect was seen of this happening without ascertaining the Argentine interest and <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> interest was genuine: 'On the face of it, a strike aircraft would be entirely suitable for an attack on the Falklands.' Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands less than three months later.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E

5|$|Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star's {{habitable}} zone, {{some have}} speculated {{on the possibility}} of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system. While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life, simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbor Earth-mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years. Such moons, if they exist, may be able to provide a habitable environment, though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> satellites would form in the first place. Additionally, a small planet in one of the gas giant's Trojan points could survive in a habitable orbit for long periods. The high mass of HD 28185 b, of over six Jupiter masses, actually makes either of these scenarios more likely than if the planet was about Jupiter's mass or less.|$|E
5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> delegation offends the law.

On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied {{that there was no}} point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained <b>whether</b> <b>such</b> a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account.
