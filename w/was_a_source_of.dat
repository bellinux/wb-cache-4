5|$|About 130 {{volcanic}} vents {{belong to}} {{the field and the}} earliest eruptions occurred 1.5 million years ago. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous explosive and effusive components, and volcanic rocks in the field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite. The field <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> obsidian with regional importance.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 {{to cover}} an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{much of the}} {{background}} information in the story. While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.|$|E
25|$|Thionyl {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} confused with sulfuryl chloride, SO2Cl2, but {{the properties of}} these compounds differ significantly.

50|$|Sulfuryl {{chloride}} {{is commonly}} confused with thionyl chloride, SOCl2. The properties {{of these two}} sulfur oxychlorides are quite different: sulfuryl chloride <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> chlorine whereas thionyl chloride <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> chloride ions. An alternative IUPAC name is sulfuroyl dichloride.|$|R
5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> camaraderie and solidarity. His second {{purpose was to}} identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{enduring}} {{symbols of the}} landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large granodiorite boulder that was near their landing site at Plymouth. However, none of the contemporary accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing, not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> fresh water and fish.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I {{at the end of}} July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October 1916; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war. Spetsai was decommissioned in 1920 and used as a naval communications school until 1929, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E

Kilkis {{was reduced to a}} skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed. Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. Kilkis, however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies, and instead was used solely for harbor defense {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|By 1914, Psara {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from active duty {{to serve as}} a training ship for engine room personnel.

5|$|David was {{conceptualized}} {{as a character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to a character directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the hostility}} with which Candaules was met on its exhibition, it {{was bought by}} Robert Vernon, who had made a fortune {{supplying}} horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection. Vernon presented his collection to the nation in 1847, although {{in the case of}} Candaules a painting so controversial becoming government property <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> some embarrassment. In 1929 Candaules was transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929, and married her in April 1945. In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, took her own life with Hitler's gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> deep, lasting pain. Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, {{in what is now}} Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
5|$|Mangalore {{developed}} as a port on the Arabian Sea—remaining, to this day, a major port of India. Mangalore's port handles 75 per cent of India's coffee and cashew exports. Mangalore {{is used as a}} staging point for sea traffic along the Malabar Coast. Mangalore was ruled by several major powers, including the Kadambas, Alupas, Vijayanagar Empire, Keladi Nayaks and the Portuguese. The city <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> contention between the British and the Mysore rulers, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Eventually annexed by the British in 1799, Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947. The city was unified with the state of Mysore (now called Karnataka) in 1956.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, 1970, Wilhelm was {{selected}} off waivers by the Chicago Cubs, {{for whom he}} appeared in three games. He was traded back to the Braves for Hal Breeden after the season. As the Cubs had acquired Wilhelm {{late in the season}} to bolster their playoff contention, the trade back to the Braves <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> controversy. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn investigated the transaction, and in December ruled that he did not find evidence of impropriety associated with the transactions that sent Wilhelm to the Cubs and quickly back to the Braves.|$|E
