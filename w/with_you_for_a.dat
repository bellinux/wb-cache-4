500|$|The {{biography}} is comprehensive, covering {{many different}} aspects of its subject's life. The author discusses Morrison's early life in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how this influenced his perspective of [...] "no surrender", a reference to Ulster Unionism. Rogan writes how, a young boy, Morrison exhibited [...] "poor communication skills, aggressive impatience, and absence of empathy", and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends. The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all. He'd play along <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while until he got bored â€“ he seemed to tire of it quickly. He'd go indoors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you are forced, you say, {{to play a}} craven's part; believe me, sir, I {{would not}} change places <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kingdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I wish to {{be alone}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes. Since what I said to you this morning, you have written to Colonel Osborne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{the devil}} be <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> obstinate and presumptuous fool," [...] muttered the knight, [...] "that cannot be quiet till thou art {{knocked on the}} head!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, Mrs. Hopkins. If {{you were}} asking me into a house of your own, I would go in and see all the rooms and chat <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour; but I don't suppose I shall ever go into this house again unless things change very much indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{shall have}} my fling," [...] said the minx. [...] "I shall begin to-night, <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience. I shall make the doctor look to himself. But {{there is the}} dressing-bell." [...] And as {{we went into the}} house, [...] "I believe my mother is a Whig, Richard. All the Brices are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "American slang," [...] he {{explained}} penitently. [...] "I am sorry. I {{meant that it}} was very pleasant to be here alone <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} her staying <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time until I can make arrangements," [...] {{suggested}} Commander Raffleton. [...] "I'd be awfully obliged if you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will permit}} me, I hope," [...] he said, {{appealing}} {{as much to}} Gerard as to his daughter, [...] "to enter <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Caterina,' he {{answered}} gravely; 'I want you. I have something very particular {{to say to}} you. Will you let me sit down <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would that}} thy father {{would make the}} {{acquaintance}} of Stefano Milano," [...] resumed the gondolier, taking a long breath, after a still longer draught. [...] "'Tis a padrone of Calabria, who oftentimes brings into the port excellent liquors of his country, and who would pass a cask of the red lachryma christi through the Broglio itself, and not a noble of them all should see it. The man is here at present, and, if thou wilt, he shall not be long without coming into terms <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few skins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aren't {{you afraid}} that you'll bore her?" [...] And as her {{companion}} stared at this enquiry Isabel added: [...] "If she can't dance <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour how {{will she be}} able to dance <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} I must {{ask you first}} of all before I stay <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Must I put it into words?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you do not}} object," [...] {{he remarked}} with some stiffness, [...] "I should like to sit here <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little time. There is {{certainly}} a breeze." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come along, {{you very}} lazy people! Arnold, may I walk <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little way? Arthur {{is not at}} all {{brilliant}} this morning, and he does not amuse me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} you were here," [...] said Clarence, much relieved, he knew not why, [...] "but I am glad, for I wanted to speak <b>with</b> <b>you</b> alone <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art {{not just}} to Miantonimoh, child," [...] {{answered}} Ruth, as she glanced her eye rapidly round to seek the boy, who had modestly withdrawn into a remote and shaded corner of the room. [...] "I left him <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guardian, and not as one who would wish to injure. Now think of thy God, child," [...] imprinting {{a kiss on the}} cold, marble-like forehead of her daughter, [...] "and have reliance in his goodness. Miantonimoh, I again leave <b>you</b> <b>with</b> a charge, to be their protector," [...] she added, quitting her daughter and advancing towards the youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes; that's very likely;" [...] and Mr. Lugare bulged out {{his nose}} and cheeks with contempt. [...] "Do you think to make me believe your lies? I've found you out, sir, plainly enough; and I am {{satisfied}} that you are as precious a little villain {{as there is in}} the State. But I will postpone settling <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour yet. I shall then call you up again; and if you don't tell the whole truth then, I will give you something that'll make you remember Mr. Nichols's melons <b>for</b> many <b>a</b> month to come:--go to your seat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean this}} very moment, love. Indeed, I {{want to sit}} <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while," [...] and she put her right arm affectionately round her daughter's waist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{with me in}} {{the pony}} carriage, Jasper. I've not had a drive <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long while, and should enjoy it so much," [...] said my lady, detaining him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Done <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hundred pounds," [...] was the prompt answer--so prompt that Captain Leigh {{realized}} he had driven a fool's bargain which it was incumbent upon him to amend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, hang me if I bid you farewell, man," [...] said Simon, {{striking}} {{the flat of}} his hand against that which the armourer expanded towards him. [...] "I will shake no hands <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour to come at least. Tarry but a moment, man, and I will explain all this; and surely {{a few drops of}} blood from a scratch, and a few silly words from a foolish wench's lips, are not to part father and son when they have been so long without meeting? Stay, then, man, if ever <b>you</b> would wish <b>for</b> <b>a</b> father's blessing and St. Valentine's, whose blessed eve this chances to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thou wilt be {{the death}} of me!" [...] cried the old witch, convulsed with laughter. [...] "That was well said. If an honest man and a gentleman may! Thou playest thy part to perfection. Get along <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smart fellow; and I will wager on thy head, {{as a man of}} pith and substance, with a brain and what they call a heart, and all else that a man should have, against any other thing on two legs. I hold myself a better witch than yesterday, for thy sake. Did not I make thee? And I defy any witch in New England to make such another! Here; take my staff along with thee!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I've promised, Jim, and you wouldn't make me out a liar. She does {{but want}} to talk <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> it is <b>a</b> lonely life she leads." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir?" [...] said Mr. Bucket. [...] "Then {{you will}} be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment while I go and have half a word with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{with their}} pack and their outlooking smiles the Applebys {{prepared}} to start, next day, {{and turned to}} say good-by to Crook, he started, cried, [...] "I will!" [...] and added, [...] "I'm coming <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} in the brougham. But you take a weight off my bosom! I am going to stay <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day or two; and now my {{reputation}} (or Mrs. Lumley's) is safe. Your servants never saw Mrs. Lumley?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! my {{dear friend}} and ingle, Tony Foster!" [...] he exclaimed, seizing upon the unwilling hand, and shaking it with such {{emphasis}} as almost to stagger the sturdy frame of the person whom he addressed, [...] "how fares it <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> many <b>a</b> long year? What! have you altogether forgotten your friend, gossip, and playfellow, Michael Lambourne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, nurse," [...] he said. [...] "I'm off. Take care of {{our young}} friend. He {{is going to be}} very useful to us as soon as he can use his feet and get about. I'll come and sit <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> half <b>an</b> hour next visiting day, if I may?" [...] he added, turning to the patient.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing to father, Cyril?" [...] she asked, in low tones; [...] "he has been quite unlike himself all day. Generally when he is out of temper he rates {{everyone}} heartily, as if we were a mutinous crew, but to-day he has gone about scarcely speaking; he hasn't said a cross word to any of us, but several times when I spoke to him I got no answer, and {{it is easy to see}} that he is terribly put out about something. He was in his usual spirits at breakfast; then, you know, he was talking <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, and it does not take much guessing to see that it must have been something that passed between you that has put him out. Now what was it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "they {{are turning}} {{out the lights}} here. You {{want to know about}} Wenham's property. Let me come upstairs <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little time and I will tell you as much as I can from memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{conclusions}} are vague but disturbing. Lawrence trusted you and, you tell us, started <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place {{he did not}} intend to reach. Since then he has vanished. It is possible that you have deceived both him and us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{out of my}} sight," [...] she said, very low, [...] "and from my father's house! Forth <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mocker and a gangrel loon!"--speaking in {{our common}} Scots,--"and herd with the base thieves from whom you came, coward and mocking malapert!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{coming to}} Melchester on Saturday, {{to get my}} things [...] away from the T. S., &c. I could walk <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> half [...] <b>an</b> hour, if you would like?--Your repentant ...|$|R
50|$|Cornelis Willem (Gordon) Heuckeroth (born 6 July 1968, Amsterdam) is a Dutch {{performer}} and {{radio and television}} personality, better known by his nickname Gordon.

6000|$|... "A conspiracy," [...] he repeated, [...] "in the Hotel Universal.
