5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1851, women in several states <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division was {{selected}} to undertake the task of recapturing Attu Island. The division arrived at Cold Bay on April 30, 1943, and, despite the cold weather prevailing in the region, many of the American troops <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> only regular field clothing as the division had previously been stationed in California. Due to poor weather, the Americans' assault on Attu was delayed twice – first to May 4 and then to May 11. When the operation commenced on May 11, heavy fog shrouded the recapturing force from the Japanese, which hampered the latter's attempts at defending the island.|$|E
5|$|The Laws of the Game specify {{that all}} players, {{regardless}} of gender, must {{wear the same}} kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team FC de Rakt made international headlines by swapping its old strip {{for a new one}} featuring short skirts and tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the KNVB, Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> hot pants under their skirts, and were therefore technically in compliance.|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were {{particularly interested in the}} JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> out; without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} {{collared}} dolman, sometimes {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight breeches of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E

5|$|Monk is briefly {{separated}} from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, {{despite the lack of}} supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1999, Columbine High School {{students}} Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold {{shot dead}} 12 {{students and a}} teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In {{the aftermath of the}} school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

5|$|Scherzinger {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time in Stratford, London at Westfield Stratford City on September 13, 2011. The performance was included in a set of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather coat in red and black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a cutaway black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to reveal an even racier outfit underneath. She than wore a black leather number covered in tassels and chains. Scherzinger's performance was accompanied onstage by several dancers, whom <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> shiny metallic trousers, as she performed in front of thousands of fans. The song was also performed in 2012 on her first solo tour, the Killer Love Tour.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E
5|$|The second {{main event}} match had Bearer's Undertaker {{fighting}} DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker {{walked to the}} ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.|$|E

5|$|Sporadic {{experiments}} with numbered shirts {{took place in}} the 1920s but the idea did not initially catch on. The first major match in which numbers were worn was the 1933 FA Cup Final between Everton and Manchester City. Rather than the numbers being added to the clubs' existing strips, two special sets, one white and one red, were made for the final and allocated to the two teams by the toss of a coin. The Everton players wore numbers 1–11, while the City players wore 12–22. It was not until {{around the time of the}} Second World War that numbering became standard, with teams wearing numbers 1–11. Although there were no regulations on which player should wear which number, specific numbers came to be associated with specific positions on the field of play, a prime example being the number 9 shirt which was usually reserved for the team's main striker. In contrast to the usual practice, Scottish club Celtic wore numbers on their shorts rather than their shirts until 1975 for international matches, and until 1994 for domestic matches. The 1930s also saw great advancements in boot manufacture, with new synthetic materials and softer leathers becoming available. By 1936 players in Europe <b>were</b> <b>wearing</b> boots which weighed only a third of the weight of the rigid boots of a decade earlier, although British clubs did not adopt the new-style boots, with players such as Billy Wright openly pronouncing their disdain for the new footwear and claiming that it was more suited to ballet than football.|$|E
