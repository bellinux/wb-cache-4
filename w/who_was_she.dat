6000|$|... "I cannot tell. I {{only know}} I have a horror of her, a sudden {{shrinking}} whenever {{her name is}} mentioned. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> do you suppose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come {{on to the}} parade-ground, Mulvaney, it's cooler there, {{and tell}} me about Miss McKenna. What <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> and <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> and why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> called 'Jhansi'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O dreamer of dreams, {{interpret}} {{your own}} dream. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> about my throne of whom I should beware, and <b>who</b> <b>is</b> the magician {{with whom she}} made a pact?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The women, {{naturally}} {{curious and}} sympathetic, questioned her {{in one way}} and another. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> {{what had happened to}} her, where were her people or friends? How had she ever escaped robbers and Indians in that awful country? Was she really Durade's daughter? ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to affirm}} it? And {{what was she}} doing with {{unsatisfied}} desires? She was ashamed. She ignored them and left them out of count as much as possible, her underneath yearnings. They angered her. She wanted to be like other people, decently satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you remark her face? A {{very odd}} expression--a sort of--what shall I call it?--Very odd indeed! <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> I saw {{her at the}} grave this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, do tell {{us about}} her. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Does she perform for a living? What kind of a person are we to expect?" [...] volleyed Miss Brush.|$|R
25|$|Sion remembers <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> and <b>she</b> survives.|$|R
60|$|And {{what and}} <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> that had haunted me? She, I had {{actually}} seen three times. Not {{a woman of}} my acquaintance had the stature of that ghost. She was not of a female height. Not to any man I knew could the machination, for a moment, be attributed.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{think this}} is where they are most likely to grow, Uncle," [...] persisted the girl, [...] "just consider. A retired sea captain hides inland, with no companions but a {{grinning}} sailor and his blind housekeeper --except his pale wife, of course; and she is described as sad and unhappy. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> do you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|No one breathed. It {{was as if}} {{they had}} been {{permitted}} to gaze upon one of heaven's angelic choir. How came she there? <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> Before these questions could be framed she disappeared, silently as a bubble on the water, leaving behind only that delicious, subtle, unaccountable odor as of tropic fruits and unknown flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A lady!' {{cried the}} Emperor smiling. 'We {{do not see}} many faces in the camp which have not a {{moustache}} upon them. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> What does she want?' ...|$|R

"Nay, but go on," [...] {{said the}} page, [...] "for {{you will be}} {{presently}} interrupted; the two good dames have been soaring yonder on the balcony, like two old hooded crows, and their croak grows hoarser as night comes on; they will wing to roost presently.--This mistress of yours, fair gentlewoman, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> in God's name?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs Hurtle {{promised that}} she would speak to Ruby, though when making the promise she could not but think of her unfitness for the task. She knew nothing of the country. She had not a single friend in it, but Paul Montague;--and she had run after him with as little {{discretion}} as Ruby Ruggles was showing in running after her lover. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> that she should take upon herself to give advice to any female? ...|$|E

6000|$|But <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> the Lady of the dead, [...] Tombed in a palace? Was she chaste and fair? [...] Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?

60|$|Miss Brewster—we {{had learned}} her {{name from the}} engineer—slept on and on. At supper I {{requested}} the hunters to lower their voices, so she was not disturbed; {{and it was not}} till next morning that she made her appearance. It had been my intention to have her meals served apart, but Wolf Larsen put down his foot. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> that she should be too good for cabin table and cabin society? had been his demand.|$|E
60|$|I ran I {{knew not}} where, {{but it was}} towards the beach. As I went, my head whirled; so strange, so sudden, were these events and insults. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> what, in Heaven's name, the power she wielded over my obedient negroes? Why had she {{addressed}} me as a slave? why spoken of my father's sale? To all these tumultuary questions I could find no answer; and, in the turmoil of my mind, nothing was plain except the hateful, leering image of the woman.|$|E

6000|$|He, when he {{had left}} her, was angry with his own weakness. He had not only promised {{that he would make}} his {{application}} to the Duke, but that he would do so within the period of a week. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> that she should exact terms from him after this fashion, and prescribe days and hours? And now, because this strange woman had spoken to him, he was compelled to make a journey down to the Duke's country house, and seek an interview in which he would surely be snubbed! ...|$|E
60|$|He was there, of course. <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> that {{he danced}} with? Perhaps some unknown woman, far beneath herself in culture, was by that most subtle of lures sealing his fate this very instant. To dance {{with a man}} is to {{concentrate}} a twelve-month's regulation fire upon him in the fragment of an hour. To pass to courtship without acquaintance, to pass to marriage without courtship, is a skipping of terms reserved for those alone who tread this royal road. She would see how his heart lay by keen observation of them all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hastened {{away from}} him to think. My fears had been confirmed. It was not she who had first crossed the plank. Therefore it was not she with whom I had fallen in love. Nothing could be plainer than that I {{was in love with}} the wrong person. All the time I had loved another. But <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> Besides, did I love her? Certainly not. Yes, but why did I love this one? The whole {{foundation}} of my love had been swept away. Yet the love remained. Which is absurd.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Annabel {{who lives}} here, who sings {{every night at}} the 'Unusual'? They call her by your old name. Her hair and voice and figure are as yours used to <b>be.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> I say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{flambeau}} glares still {{within a}} yard, held up in a park-keeper's hand; its long eager tongue of flame almost licks {{the figure of}} the Expected--there--where she stands full in my sight.
