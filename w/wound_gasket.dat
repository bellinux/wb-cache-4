50|$|Spiral wound gaskets {{are also}} used in high {{pressure}} pipelines and are made with stainless steel outer and inner rings and a center filled with spirally wound stainless steel tape wound together with graphite and PTFE, formed in V shape. Internal pressure acts upon {{the faces of the}} V, forcing the gasket to seal against the flange faces. Most spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> applications will use two standard gasket thicknesses: 1/8 inch and 3/16 inch. With 1/8 inch thick gaskets, compression to a 0.100 inch thickness is recommended. For 3/16 inches, compress to a 0.13 inch thickness.|$|E
50|$|Tighten {{the bolts}} on the flange. Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other factors}} such as spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.|$|E

40|$|The {{buckling}} of spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gaskets</b> (SWGs) causes turbulence of {{the fluid}} flow inside flanges and {{may result in}} leakage failure over time due to the unwinding of the spirals. A few limited studies on the lateral forces generated by axial compression of the gasket sealing element which cause this phenomenon {{are available in the}} literature. The lateral forces are generated during initial tightening and are not distributed uniformly in the circumferential direction. Hence there is an introduction of concentrated forces in small areas. The non-uniform gasket contact stress caused by the tightening sequence makes the problem more complex. It is suggested to study experimentally the buckling of spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gaskets</b> by developing a special test bench designed for this purpose. This test bench is able to measure the lateral loads and winding inward displacement during the tightening process. The experimental results are to be compared to those obtained by numerical FE simulation for the purpose of extrapolating for other size gaskets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the research and}} evaluation of the gaskets used in pipe systems. Referring to the title "Failure Analysis of Pipe Joint Gaskets Spiral wound”, this gasket is suitable for use in piping systems Spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> designs are typically used in flat faced pipe flanges. They are also often used in pump applications with recessed flanges. Spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> {{is an important component}} in the pipe system, this is because it functions as an additional component during the installation process pipe. It works to prevent the occurrence of leakage in the pipe connection system. These gaskets also have the distinct advantages that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures because the material used for manufacturing is gasket material that can withstand the high temperatures and pressures. Gasket is made up of several main sections, "inner ring, filler, and outer ring. " Each section has its own features to prevent the leakage occurred. This matter to avoid the accident happened to the workers in this sector. The methodology of this project through the drawing spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> using solid works and convert the drawing into Algor software. The mechanical test like tensile test, hardness test and metallurgical test also conduct in this project. All of the result has been discussed in this project and has been compared with other result. The mechanical test result has been record in this project, this is needed for the comparison between the analysis result. For the Algor analysis, it has been through the simulation to find stress and strain for the spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket.</b> For this analysis pressure (100 kN and 500 kN) has been applied in both directions. This is important to compare the value of the analysis to know the better type of gasket.

The bolt length and flange geometry was measured before and after loading the bolts, and before and after heating the sample {{in order to measure}} changes in the bolt load and flange rotation which would indicate creep/relaxation in the joint.

40|$|Gasketed {{bolted flange}} joints {{are the most}} {{critical}} components in pipelines for their sealing and strength under operating conditions. Most of the work available in literature is under static loading, whereas in industry, cyclic loads are applied due to the vibrating machinery such as motors, pumps, sloshing in offshore applications and in the ships etc. In this study a three dimensional finite element analysis of a gasketed joint is carried out using a spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> under bolt up and dynamic operating conditions (internal pressure, axial and bending) singly and in combination. The cyclic axial loads are concluded relatively more challenging for both the sealing and strength of the joint.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange tightening {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping flange joints are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the bolted flange joints and the workability of flange tightening work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on flange bolts, while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the bolted flanges applying spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gaskets,</b> measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the bolted flanges and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed pipe flange connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gaskets</b> were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter pipe flange connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.

Non-welded part of the equipment where conducting oil flows, usually require sealing gasket to prevent leakage of heat-conducting oil, if seal is not good, oil leakage, can cause serious accidents [2].

30|$|Taking the {{advantages}} of low and high temperatures, low and high pressures and corrosion, the metal sealing gaskets are suitable for oil-gas exploitation, chemical industry and nuclear industry, where rubber seals are prohibited [12]. SPMC is a static metal seal without gasket, and the optimal sealing performance is the key technology. Up to now the researches of the pipeline connection are extensive, but few of them focus {{on the design of}} connector without gasket. In the design of a connector with gasket, the gasket factor and minimum gasket seating stress should be determined according to the design codes [13, 14] subject to gasket material and structural. These codes are based on a series of assumptions and might not define calculation procedures for sealing performance in detail [15]. Persson [16] and Kazeminia et al. [17] revaluated the leakage of metallic seal, which was used to design bolted flanged connections. Zhao et al. [18], established the mathematical relationship between the contact stress of metal sealing ring governing the sealing performance, the structural parameters and operating pressure, but did not consider the plastic deformation of metallic gasket. Sawa et al. [19] and Takaki et al. [20] studied the contact pressure on the sealing surface by elastic-plastic finite element analysis with regard of nonlinearity of gasket and internal pressure. However, the analysis is for the spiral <b>wound</b> <b>gasket</b> only. Nitta et al. [21], analyzed the critical contact pressure to eliminate the radial leakage paths by the quantitative analysis of the leakage, but did not discover the critical contact pressure to fully block the leakage paths. Using a finite element analysis approach, Joshi et al. [22], and Abid et al. [23] studied the flange connection without gasket, which concluded surface profiles, thickness of flange and bolt pre-stress had effects on the stress in the flange and bolts as well as flange rotation and displacement, but the effects on sealing performance wasn’t investigated. Guindani et al. [24], studied the deformation recovery of sealing material and optimized the sealing performance of rubber. Bouzid et al. [25] and Wu et al. [26] proved the mean contact pressure and its distribution on sealing surface took important effects on sealing performance. By finite element analysis and experiment, Noga et al. [27] proved the suitable contact pressure and width of plastic deformation were the key parameters to guarantee the sealing performance of flange connection without gasket. However, the critical values of contact pressure and plastic deformation are not investigated. According to the above researches, the right contact pressure will make the plastic deformation happen on sealing surface and block micro leakage paths. Therefore, the contact pressure is essential for the optimal sealing performance of SPMC.|$|E
