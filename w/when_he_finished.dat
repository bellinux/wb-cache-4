5|$|In 1820 Balzac {{completed}} the five-act verse tragedy Cromwell. Although it pales {{by comparison with}} his later works, some critics consider it a quality text. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished,</b> Balzac went to Villeparisis and read the entire work to his family; they were unimpressed. He followed this effort by starting (but never finishing) three novels: Sténie, Falthurne, and Corsino.|$|E
5|$|In the London Chess Classic, played 3–12 December, Carlsen's {{streak of}} tournament {{victories}} ended <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> third, behind Kramnik and Nakamura. Carlsen won three games and drew five. Although {{he did not}} win the tournament, Carlsen gained rating points, rising to a new personal record of 2835.|$|E

5|$|The August 15 quarterfinals saw Thompson in {{the second}} heat, where he again took first place <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> the race in 9.99seconds. Thompson {{defeated}} the United States' Tyson Gay (10.09seconds) and France's Mbandjock (10.16seconds). This time, out of the forty quarterfinalists, Thompson tied the Netherlands Antilles' Martina for second place behind only Usain Bolt. Thompson advanced to semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Until 1295, Nicholas was {{referred}} to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea). It is probable that he adopted de Sancto Andrea <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back.|$|E
5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

5|$|Isa Phillips participated on Jamaica's behalf in the men's 400meters hurdles race. Born in {{the capital}} city of Kingston, Phillips was 24 years old when he participated in the Beijing Olympics. He had not {{previously}} taken part in any Olympic games. During the August 15 qualification round, Phillips competed in the fourth heat. During the course of the events, Phillips placed third out of a heat of six people <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> the race in 49.55seconds. Periklis Iakovakis of Greece placed ahead of him (49.50seconds) in second place, while Kerron Clement of the United States placed first in the heat (49.42seconds). Japan's Dai Tamesue placed behind Phillips (49.82seconds). Out of the 25 finishing athletes, Phillips placed 14th. He progressed to the semifinal round.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1819 at York, Blacklock {{finished}} second of seven in a two-mile sweepstakes of 20 guineas each. The race was won by The Marshall. On 18 May he started as the evens favourite for the two-mile Gold Cup. He {{won the race}}, with Paulowitz finishing second, Torch-bearer third and Otho fourth. At the York August Meeting, Blacklock faced three rivals in the four-mile Great Subscription Purse for five-year-olds and older. The Duchess started as the 5/2 favourite, with Blacklock and St. Helena both at 3/1 and Magistrate at 4/1. Blacklock won the race from Magistrate, with The Duchess finishing in third place. Blacklock's final race came two days later, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> second to St. Helena in a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over two miles. During his racing career Blacklock had twenty-three races, winning seventeen of those, placing second four times and third once.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> {{third in a}} five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year {{he earned his}} second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At {{the time of his}} retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties). In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Cielo led the Brazilian 4×100-metre {{freestyle}} relay {{team to a}} 4th-place finish, along with Nicolas Oliveira, Guilherme Roth and Fernando Silva. In this event, he opened {{with a time of}} 47.39 seconds in the heats (a South American and Championship record) and a time of 47.09 seconds in the final, only 0.04 seconds from beating Eamon Sullivan's world record, and earning the second fastest {{time in the history of}} the 100-metre freestyle. In the 100-metre freestyle final, the Brazilian swimmer won the gold medal, defeating the Olympic champion Alain Bernard and breaking the world record with a time of 46.91 seconds, entering into the select pantheon of swimmers who won an Olympic gold, a World Championships gold, and a World Record. In the 50-metre freestyle final, Cielo defeated world record holder Frédérick Bousquet and won the gold medal with a time of 21.08 seconds, beating the competition record and the Americas record. Cielo became the third swimmer to achieve this feat in a single World Championship, after Anthony Ervin and Alexander Popov. Popov, Ervin, and Cielo each won Olympic and World Championship gold medals in the 50-metre freestyle in succession. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>finished</b> the 4×100-metre medley, a contest where the first four relays in the race beat the US world record from the 2008 Summer Olympics, Cielo led Brazil to fourth place, along with Guilherme Guido, Henrique Barbosa and Gabriel Mangabeira, very close to winning the event's bronze and silver medals. His two gold medals at the World Championships led Brazil to the best performance in the history of the competition.|$|E
