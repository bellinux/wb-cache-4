5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi trying to come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was {{not in the business of}} making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

25|$|While Turing's bombe {{worked in}} theory, it {{required}} impractically long cribs {{to rule out}} sufficiently large numbers of settings.

25|$|Boron and Graphite rods {{came around}} in the 1960s and 1970s when the United States and United Kingdom {{invested}} considerable research into developing the new technologies.

25|$|In California, {{measures}} {{were taken to}} first define and then ban assault weapons, resulting in the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989. On the Federal level, Congressional legislators struggled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to ban weapons such as military-style rifles without banning sporting-type rifles. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush signed an executive order (the Semi-Automatic Assault Rifle Ban) banning importation of assault weapons. The federal assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994, and expired in 2004. President Bill Clinton signed another executive order in 1994 which banned importation of most firearms and ammunition from China.|$|E

25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E
500|$|As {{the player}} accomplishes objectives, the player {{character}} is rewarded with [...] "skill points". Skill points {{are used to}} enhance a character's abilities in eleven different areas, and were designed to provide players <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to customize their characters; a player might create a combat-focused character by increasing proficiency with pistols or rifles, while a more furtive character can be created by focusing on lock picking and computer hacking abilities. There are four different levels of proficiency in each skill, with the skill point cost increasing for each successive level.|$|E
500|$|Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson {{were busy}} adding the {{finishing}} touches to their own episodes—"Hollywood A.D." [...] and [...] "All Things", respectively—the writers struggled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to create a convincing story, but not force Mulder and Scully to be in every scene. The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to get sick in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, [...] "Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being {{in a hospital bed}} for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time. It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be {{in a lot of different}} locations." ...|$|E

500|$|Shifgrethor is {{a fictional}} concept in the Hainish universe, first {{introduced}} in The Left Hand of Darkness. It is first mentioned by Genly Ai, {{when he thinks}} to himself [...] "shifgrethor—prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority in Karhide and all civilizations of Gethen". It derives from an old Gethenian word for shadow. George Slusser describes shifgrethor as [...] "not rank, but its opposite, the ability to maintain equality in any relationship, {{and to do so}} by respecting the person of the other". According to University of West Georgia Professor Carrie B. McWhorter, shifgrethor can be defined simply as [...] "a sense of honor and respect that provides the Gethenians <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to save face in a time of crisis".|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech {{professor}} and Persuasive Games CEO Ian Bogost defended {{the use of}} Manchester Cathedral in the game. He described Sony's apology as [...] "self-defeating" [...] and criticised Sony and Insomniac Games for not explaining their goals {{with the use of}} the cathedral. He wrote that the cathedral was [...] "one of the only significant experiences in the whole game", where he otherwise described it as [...] "not a game richly imbued with wisdom." [...] He wrote that video games provided players <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to experience war time situations and called the use of the cathedral [...] "the most powerful of these moments" [...] and the [...] "subtlest" [...] in Resistance. He argued that the use of an accurate depiction of the monument instead of an anonymous location encourages players to pay attention to it as a structure that [...] "demands respect." [...] He wrote that Resistance [...] "adds a fictional homage to the church’s resolve".|$|E
500|$|Treves's {{depiction}} of Tom Norman, the showman who had exhibited Merrick, {{was that of}} a cruel drunk who had ruthlessly exploited his charge. In a letter to the World's Fair newspaper, and later in his own memoirs, Norman denied this characterisation and said that he provided his show attractions <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of earning a living, and that at the London Hospital, Merrick was still on display, but with no control over how or when he was viewed. According to Nadja Durbach, author of The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture, Norman's view gives an insight into the Victorian freak show's function as a means of survival for poor people with deformities, as well as the attitude of medical professionals of the time. Durbach cautions that both Treves's and Norman's memoirs must be understood as [...] "narrative reconstructions ... that reflect personal and professional prejudices and cater to the demands and expectations of their very different audiences".|$|E

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, {{the first thing he did}} was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{discover}} that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) {{has agreed to}} return with his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble), to his own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible {{for the end of}} the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team—composed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James—successfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.|$|E

He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by [...] "MKNZ") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an [...] "exact digital copy" [...] of himself who calls himself [...] "Teddy" [...] (for unknown reasons). [...] "Teddy", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host {{for the remainder of the}} program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his [...] "wife".|$|E
