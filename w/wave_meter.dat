50|$|The {{gameplay}} in Endless Mode differs {{slightly from}} Stages Mode, as goobugs as introduced progressively in waves. While some waves may manifest as goobugs spawning at random positions within the ooze, other waves {{will appear in}} a more structured manner, like chains of goobugs slowly approaching the rotozoan, or rows of goobugs aggressively running across the screen from both sides. The <b>wave</b> <b>meter,</b> indicated {{by a series of}} white dots in the upper right corner of the screen, will indicate how many goobugs that are needed to be absorbed, before the next wave emerges. The scoring system is another important aspect of Endless Mode, that allows the player to play for a high score. The points earned are determined by the length of each tentacle, so for every goobug that is matched, the player will earn a number of points reflecting the number of cells that the tentacle was extended to. For instance, if the yellow tentacle has four cells, the next yellow goobug absorbed will reward 5 points. If the player is also able to make matches rapidly, a multiplier bonus can be achieved for each match. This bonus will then increase for each successive match, until it peaks at ×5. When the game is over, the highest score achieved will be displayed on the title screen, when Endless Mode is selected.|$|E

In 1905, he {{constructed}} {{a set of}} radio-controlled naval torpedoes, which, after unsuccessfully trying to interest the U.S. government, were sold to the Japanese navy. By the end of 1906, the U.S. Navy had purchased three land and eighteen shipboard transmitters from the firm, and the company's equipment was [...] "regarded as the best of its time by naval radio operators".

5000|$|The FPS-16 system {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Project Mercury tracking network did not have adequate displays and controls for reliably acquiring the spacecraft in the acquisition time available. Consequently, a contract was negotiated with a manufacturer to provide the instrumentation radar acquisition (IRACQ)RAnge Acquisition modifications. For the near earth spacecraft involved a major limitation of the FPS-16 was its mechanical range gear box, a wonderful piece of engineering. However, for a target at a range typically, say, [...] at acquisition of signal AOS, the radar was tracking second time around, that is, the pulse received in this interpulse period was that due to the previously transmitted pulse, {{and it would be}} indicating a range of [...] As the range closed the return pulse became {{closer and closer to the}} time at which the next transmitter pulse should occur. If they were allowed to coincide, remembering that the transmit-receive switch disconnected the receive (Rx) and connected the transmit (Tx) to the antenna at that instant, track would be lost. So, IRACQ provided an electronic ranging system, the function of which was to provide the necessary gating pulses to the Az and El receiver channels so that the system would maintain angle track. The system utilized a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO as the clock generator for the range counters. An early/late gate system derived an error voltage which either increased a closing target or decreased an opening target the clock frequency, thus causing the gates to be generated so as to track the target. It also, when the target reached an indicated range of less than 16000 yd, took over the generation of transmitter trigger pulses and delayed these by 16000 yd, thus enabling the received pulses to pass through the Big Bang, as it was called, of normally timed Tx pulses. The radar operator, would, while IRACQ maintained angle track be slewing the range system from minimum range to maximum so as to regain track of the target at its true range of <500 nmi (900 km). As the target passed through point of closest approach (PCA) and increased in range the process was repeated at maximum range indication. The most difficult passes were those in which the orbit was such that the target came to PCA at a range of, say 470 nmi. That pass required the radar operator to work very hard as the radar closed, and then opened in range through the Big Bang in short order. The IRACQ Console contained a C-scope associated with which was a small joy stick which gave C-scope operator control of the antenna angle servo systems so that he could adjust the pointing angle to acquire the signal. IRACQ included a scan generator which drove the antenna in one of several pre-determined search patterns around the nominal pointing position, it being desirable that IRACQ acquire the target as early as possible. An essential feature of this modification is that it allows examination of all incoming video signals and allows establishment of angle-only track. Once the spacecraft has been acquired, in angle range. Other features of the IRACQ system included additional angle scan modes and radar phasing controls to permit multiple radar interrogation of the spacecraft beacon. The addition of a beacon local oscillator <b>wave</b> <b>meter</b> permitted the determination of spacecraft-transmitter frequency drift.|$|E

Two study areas have been selected along this coastal tract: Calafuria (Livorno) and Lerici-Tellaro (La Spezia), located ca. 120 km apart, the first being shaped in sandstone and the second in dolomite bedrock. Propagation of waves in the nearshore has been simulated by numerical modeling. From wave model results, validated with data from an offshore <b>wave</b> <b>meter</b> buoy, it is inferred that waves break directly on the coast or very close to it at Calafuria, whereas for Lerici-Tellaro shores, waves mostly break up to 150 m seaward of the shore platform.

Given breaking depths and the height of breakers, maximum pressure and shear stress released at the breaking point were calculated for both areas.

40|$|An all-solid-state fast-tuning lidar {{transmitter}} for range- and temporally resolved atmospheric {{gas concentration}} measurements {{has been developed}} and thoroughly tested. The instrument {{is based on a}} commercial optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser system, which has been redesigned with piezoelectric transducers mounted on the wavelength-tuning mirror and on the crystal angle tuning element in the OPO. Piezoelectric transducers similarly control a frequency-mixing stage and doubling stage, which have been incorporated to extend system capabilities to the mid-IR and UV regions. The construction allows the system to be tuned to any wavelength, in any order, in the range of the piezoelectric transducers on a shot-to-shot basis. This extends the measurement capabilities far beyond the two-wavelength differential absorption lidar method and enables simultaneous measurements of several gases. The system performance in terms of wavelength, linewidth, and power stability is monitored in real time by an etalon-based <b>wave</b> <b>meter</b> and gas cells. The tests showed that the system was able to produce radiation in the 220 - 4300 -nm-wavelength region, with an average linewidth better than 0. 2 cm(- 1) and a shot-to-shot tunability up to 160 cm(- 1) within 20 ms. The utility of real-time linewidth and wavelength measurements is demonstrated by the ability to identify occasional poor quality laser shots and disregard these measurements.
