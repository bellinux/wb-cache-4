50|$|Wollaton is {{also noted}} for the {{existence}} of one of the earliest recorded railway lines in the world, the Wollaton Wagonway. The wagonway ran between nearby Strelley and Wollaton. Horse-drawn coal <b>wagons</b> <b>travelled</b> to their destination on wooden railway lines.|$|R

50|$|The gully {{to which}} the city name refers {{actually}} exists and {{is known to be}} sizable as it provided a gradient negotiable only by bullock <b>wagons</b> <b>travelling</b> through the Mt.

50|$|The {{automobile}} {{was introduced}} to the city in 1900 through a local street fair; in 1903, the first car dealership opened, and the year after, twenty-seven Sacramentans owned cars. The number of automobile owners increased exponentially from that point. The advent of the automobile obsoleted careers involving horseback and overland <b>wagon</b> <b>travel</b> and decreased the importance of the steamboat and railroad industries.|$|R
60|$|The Ship Island {{region was}} as woodsy and tenantless as ever.

40|$|Photograph of the {{intersection}} of Sixth Street and Spurgeon Street in Santa Ana, ca. 1910. There is a large church {{at the right of}} the picture with a very tall brick steeple or bell tower. The streets are not paved, but are lined with trees and utility poles. Aside from the church, there seem to be only residential buildings on the streets.

50|$|The road {{built by}} the party was {{inadequate}} for <b>wagon</b> <b>travel</b> and required the first group {{to take it to}} make many improvements, slowing their progress. Some emigrants, including the Thorntons, were forced to abandon their wagons and possessions along the way. On November 30, 1846, Thornton arrived at Salt Creek in Yamhill District and soon after {{wrote a letter to the}} editor of the Oregon Spectator pleading for the settlers to send relief parties to the Umpqua Valley to save the belated emigrants.|$|R
50|$|An old quarry {{is located}} in the north west corner of the park, remains of the {{associated}} tramway and crusher foundations are still visible. The tramway was known as the Scoresby Tramway. The tramway was used to transport crushed rock from the quarry, it was constructed by the Dandenong Shire Council in 1912. The <b>wagons</b> <b>travelled</b> by gravity for most of the distance, when the topography leveled out, horses were used to draw the waggons. The quarry operated for approximately three years, the tramway was removed after the cessation of quarrying.|$|R
50|$|Centerville's {{cobblestone}} {{street was}} a major stop along the trail to the West. During {{the height of the}} Gold Rush, 49,000 <b>wagons</b> would <b>travel</b> along the street each year.|$|R

5000|$|Low Cocklaw is {{situated}} {{close to the}} ancient borough boundary of Berwick-upon-Tweed, which ran north-south at this point, and now forms part of the border between England and Scotland. A road or track runs along this part and, in the past, was a route allowing horse-drawn <b>wagons</b> <b>travelling</b> between England and Scotland to by-pass the tolls through Berwick. There were fords at the crossings of the rivers Tweed and Whiteadder and the wagons would need extra pulling-power to haul them up the hill north of the Whiteadder. Local tradition is that Low Cocklaw derives its name from this; a [...] "law" [...] being the local word for a hill and a [...] "cock-horse" [...] being a heavy draught horse. Hence the farm nearest the river, from which a draught horse could be hired, was Low Cocklaw and, for {{the next stage of}} the haul, the farm higher up the hill to the north was High Cocklaw. Further north again, {{on the other side of}} the hill on the same route, there is a Cocklaw Farm above Ayton village, which would have provided the same service for <b>wagons</b> <b>travelling</b> south from Scotland to England.Low Cocklaw is no longer a farm. It was converted into housing in the 1980s. On 8 December 2013 it had a population of 20, made up of 9 households.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1832 Winnsboro was {{incorporated}} as a town {{to be governed}} by an intendant and wardens.The most prominent architectural feature of Fairfield County is the Town Clock in Winnsboro. South Carolina's General Assembly authorized Winnsboro's town fathers to build a market house that [...] "shall not be of greater width than 30 ft" [...] to allow 30 ft of <b>wagon</b> <b>travel</b> on either side. The narrow building was modeled after Independence Hall in Philadelphia and built {{on the site of}} a duck pond. A clock was added in 1837, and the building has since been known as the Town Clock.|$|R
50|$|At Port Natal, Dick King who {{was there}} and could speak Zulu, was sent by Uys to uMgungundlovu to {{investigate}} with King Dingaan the possibility of granting them land to settle, when Dick King returned to Port Natal some weeks later, he reported that King Dingaan insisted they visit him in person. Johannes Uys, brother of Piet Uys {{and a number of}} comrades with a few <b>wagons,</b> <b>travelled</b> toward King Dingaanâ€™s capital at uMgungundlovu, and making a laager of wagons {{at the mouth of the}} Mvoti River, they proceeded on horseback, but were halted by a full flooded Tugela River and forced to return to the laager.|$|R
40|$|Track {{geometry}} recording {{vehicles are}} the main way of detecting track surface problems. While these vehicles locate track surface problems they may not identify track locations that produce wagon-track interaction problems. The repeated traffic of similar type in heavy haul operation may create a series of wagon-specific track irregularities. If evenly spaced these irregularities can excite severe reactions in a <b>wagon</b> <b>travelling</b> at a critical speed. The size of irregularities "seen" by a heavily loaded wagon can be significantly greater than seen by a track recording vehicle. This paper presents an on-wagon, monitoring and reporting system for wagon-track interaction during routine heavy coal haulage operations...|$|R

50|$|Kiruna Wagonâ€™s largest {{order to}} date is the {{manufacture}} of Bottom Dumper FAMMOORR050 for Swedish mining company LKAB which commenced in 2005. The new-generation ore wagon is built for a 30-tonne axle load and carries up to 100 tonnes, which is 25 per cent more than the previous generation wagons. When in operation, the ore <b>wagons</b> <b>travel</b> in pairs - two short-coupled Fanoo040 making up one Fammoorr050. The Bottom Dumpers for LKAB are manufactured in collaboration with K Industrier in MalmÃ¶, which builds the chassis while Kiruna Wagon {{is responsible for the}} manufacture of the body and hatch system and for final assembly. In September 2012, Kiruna Wagon delivered the 1000th wagon to LKAB.|$|R
50|$|Strelley is also {{notable for}} being the upper {{terminus}} {{of one of the}} earliest recorded railway lines in the world, the Wollaton Waggonway. The railway ran to Wollaton. Horse-drawn coal <b>wagons</b> <b>travelled</b> to their destination on wooden railway lines. This type of railway is known as a wagonway and it was completed during 1604. It was built by Huntingdon Beaumont working in partnership with the second occupier of Wollaton Hall, Sir Percival Willoughby. Coal mining was a significant industry in Strelley during Elizabethan and Stuart times. Notable families involved in the early mining of Strelley included the Strelleys and the Byrons; it was a Byron who sub-leased the pits to Huntingdon Beaumont.|$|R
