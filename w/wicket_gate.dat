5|$|Cricket was {{probably}} devised by children and survived for many generations as essentially a children's game. Possibly it {{was derived from}} bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman {{trying to stop the}} ball reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a gate (e.g., a <b>wicket</b> <b>gate),</b> a stool or a tree stump as the wicket. The invention of the game could have happened in Norman or Plantagenet times anytime before 1300; or even in Saxon times before 1066.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a <b>wicket</b> <b>gate</b> that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

25|$|It is the allegory The Pilgrim's Progress, written during Bunyan's twelve-year {{imprisonment}} {{although not}} published until 1678 {{six years after}} his release, that made Bunyan's name as an author with its immediate success. It remains the book for which Bunyan is best remembered. The images Bunyan uses in The Pilgrim's Progress are reflections of images from his own world; the strait gate is {{a version of the}} <b>wicket</b> <b>gate</b> at Elstow Abbey church, the Slough of Despond is a reflection of Squitch Fen, a wet and mossy area near his cottage in Harrowden, the Delectable Mountains are an image of the Chiltern Hills surrounding Bedfordshire.

25|$|Many {{theories}} exist {{about the}} origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the <b>wicket</b> <b>gate</b> into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon 'cricce', a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a 'cricket' in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used {{in the early days of}} the game (originally from the Flemish 'krickstoel', a low stool on which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages.|$|E

The shooting occurred as she was walking past a <b>wicket</b> <b>gate</b> guarded by Satwant and Beant. She was to have been interviewed by the British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television. Beant Singh shot her three times using his side-arm and Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the wicket {{is one of the}} two sets of three stumps and two bails {{at either end of the}} pitch. [...] The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat, {{attempts}} to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket. The origin of the word is from <b>wicket</b> <b>gate,</b> a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate. [...] The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775.|$|E
2500|$|The yett was {{frequently}} used as cheaper {{alternative to the}} portcullis, [...] since it was simpler in concept, less cumbersome and more practical. However, it was also used within more complex defensive arrangements. [...] The 14th-century castle at Doune, in Perthshire, had a portcullis in the main gateway supplemented by a yett, with a second yett at the far bailey end of the passage. The yetts each had two leaves, with a <b>wicket</b> <b>gate</b> inserted within one of the leaves. Commonly, the yett would be placed behind a wooden door, providing additional security should the outer door be burned.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A proper seal on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past worn wear plates allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the <b>wicket</b> <b>gates</b> are closed, water leakage past worn plates wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the <b>wicket</b> <b>gates</b> also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and proper seal. Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, wear plates, and <b>wicket</b> <b>gates,</b> improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit. The wholesale market value of this increase in energy and capacity, roughly equates to about 290, 000 per unit per year [1]. Engineering design, calculations, and performance test were conducted to improve the parameters of the seal rings, wear plates, and <b>wicket</b> <b>gates.</b> MATLAB 2 ̆ 2 ® 2 ̆ 2 and MS Excel computer software was used to analyze testing results and provide data and calculation results. This study focuses mainly on the seal rings, wear plates, and <b>wicket</b> <b>gates.</b> In order to achieve a 2...|$|R

40|$|Rotor Stator Interaction (RSI) is an {{important}} source of pressure pulsations in hydro-machinery. RSI pressure pulsa-tions induce vibrations in both stationary and rotating com-ponents.

A reversible pump-turbine with 20 <b>wicket</b> <b>gates</b> was tested with runners having six and nine blades. Numerous pressure transducers located in the prim-ing chamber, between the runner and <b>wicket</b> <b>gates,</b> and be-tween the runner crown and head cover were recorded.
