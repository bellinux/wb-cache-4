40|$|Spline {{couplings}} {{are often}} over dimensioned concerning fatigue life, {{but they are}} subjected to wear phenomena. For as concerns fatigue life, standard design methods consider {{only a part of}} the spline teeth to be in contact and this brings to underestimate the components life, so a better understanding about component fatigue behavior may allow to a weight reduction and a consequent increasing of machine efficiency. On the other hand, <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> may cause spline coupling run outs; this phenomenon is generally caused by the relative sliding between engaging teeth; the sliding may be due to kinematic conditions (angular misalignment between shafts) of teeth deflection. In order to obtain component optimization, both fatigue and wear behavior have to be taken into account. Standard spline coupling design methods do not properly consider <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> and they evaluate fatigue life with big approximations. In this work fatigue damage are experimentally and numerically investigated while <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> has been experimentally evaluated. Experimental results have been obtained by a dedicated test rig. Fatigue tests have been performed by means of a special device connected to a standard fatigue machine. Tests have been done by varying the most important working parameters (torque and misalignment angle). Experimental results have been compared with standard design methods to evaluate if and how they may over dimension the components. Results show that concerning the fatigue life, the actual component life is higher respect to that calculated by standard methods. Regarding wear behavior, results shows that whenever a relative motion between engaging teeth is present, <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> appears...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wear is {{the main}} problem in gas turbine {{combustor}} components. The mating surfaces experience surface degradation affected by <b>wear</b> <b>damage.</b> The main mechanisms of wear occurred on combustor components could be adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and fretting wear. Wear resistant materials such as Haynes 25 (L 605) and Stelitte 6 were selected {{to be used in}} reducing <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> especially on bull horn, transition piece and flow sleeve of combustor components. The reduction of wear on combustor components can be described as the extension of combustion inspection interval of a gas turbine.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the morphological texture (flat and structured) of a polyester based paint coating on the low <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> is characterised by means of roughness and gloss measurements. Using statistical methods, {{the aim of the}} investigation is to determine, among about 60 surface roughness parameters, the most relevant of them with regard to the morphological texture and the wear behaviour of polymer coatings. The level of relevance of each roughness is quantitatively assessed through the calculation of a statistical index of performance determined by combining the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the computer based Bootstrap method (CBBM). For the experimental conditions related to the present investigation, the fractal dimension and a roughness parameter directly related to the number of inflexion points of the profiles are shown to be the most relevant parameters for discriminating the different morphological textures of studied coatings and for characterising the low <b>wear</b> <b>damage,</b> respectively. Even if the gloss reduction related to the low <b>wear</b> <b>damage</b> is more visually perceptible at a macroscopic scale for the flat products than for the structured ones, the magnitude of this damage is shown to be however very similar at a microscopic scale whatever the morphological texture of the paint coatings...|$|E

The process of quantifying the <b>wear</b> or <b>damage</b> of gear teeth requires a set of measured vibration data and a model of the gear mesh dynamics. An optimization problem is formulated to determine the profile of a time-varying mesh stiffness parameter for which the model output approximates the measured data.
