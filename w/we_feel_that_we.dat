500|$|The Upper Peninsula press {{continued}} {{to report on}} Heikkinen’s every move, as he returned home shortly before Christmas, before heading west {{to play in the}} East-West Shrine Game. On his departure for California, The Bessemer Herald said: “Ralph has made every major All America team in the nation this year[...] [...] [...] Our nation has had many great men to emulate. The children of the Ramsay school not only have these in common with all others, but we have our own local hero who has gained national repute as a gentleman, scholar and last, but not least, a great athlete. To say that we are proud of Ralph is putting it mild. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very honored to have had him as a student of the Ramsay school.” ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the {{slackness}} of Congress for not {{picking up}} on the bill's perceived dangers: [...] "Those {{of us who have}} been in the study and research work of the United Nations, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." [...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E

"We {{have been}} {{influenced}} by no prejudice against the college or its objects, but <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have best done our duty both to it and our readers, by unsparingly denouncing what we consider an erroneous and inefficient system of education, and a certain delusion to those who have the misfortune to be its victims." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; he is so,--so awfully clever! <b>We</b> all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{could not}} get on without him. When you were in, {{he was one of}} your party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not; but <b>we</b> all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't disown our leader," [...] Broadwood answered. [...] "I {{dare say}} you can {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a hard row to hoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure don't I know me own feelin's best?" [...] remarked Larry, {{addressing}} Ned Sinton. [...] "It's {{all very}} well at the diggin's; {{but when it comes}} to drawin'-rooms and parlours, I feels--an' so does Bill Jones here--that we're out 'o place. In the matter o' diggin' we're all equals, no doubt; but <b>we</b> <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ain't gintlemen born, and that it's a'k'ard to the lady to be havin' sich rough customers at her table, so Bill an' me has agreed to make the most o' ourselves in the kitchen." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 9 October 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that the second series of Life on Mars would be the last. Matthew Graham stated: [...] "We decided that Sam's journey should have a finite life span and a clear-cut ending and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have now reached that point after two series". Graham's claim that two endings had been filmed was later revealed to be a ruse.|$|E
2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". The real self is who and what we {{actually}} are. [...] The ideal self {{is the type of}} person <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be. The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The ideal self is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization. (Engler 125) But {{it is important to know}} the differences between our ideal and real self.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters {{of the ban}} {{state that}} boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing {{spokesman}} for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: [...] "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must have a total ban on boxing." [...] Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for [...] "injury". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note {{that there are many}} other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.|$|E
60|$|JOANNA (coaxingly). Dear Mrs. Coade, {{whoever he}} is, and {{whatever}} he does, I beg {{you not to}} be surprised. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> though <b>we</b> had no unusual experiences in the wood, others {{may not have been}} so fortunate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{live in the}} most {{interesting}} days? There are such a lot of movements going on. It's quite exciting. <b>We</b> all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't shut our eyes any longer to social questions. I mean {{the condition of the}} people alone is enough to give one nightmare!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hence arose the saying, [...] "If I love you, {{what is that}} to you?" [...] We say {{so because}} <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> love is not in your will, but above it. It is not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in {{yourself}} and can never know.|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist Wacław [...] "Vogg" [...] Kiełtyka {{commented on}} the album, [...] "Extreme and groove — I think that's {{the best way to}} {{describe}} our new album. This time <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have something totally crushing and huge. Blood Mantra is the most heavy and mature album we ever did in our career. I cannot wait to start to play songs live because riffs are soo deep and powerful." [...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where we return to the climate of Organic Hallucinosis album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, isn’t it annoying,” went on Mrs. Peter; “seven of them. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{must live}} on cream {{for the rest}} of our lives. Of course, some of them can be changed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, don't you know? It {{seems as}} if {{it must be like}} a fine sunset, and would pass in a few minutes. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't endure sublimity long, and want it to pass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, exactly; <b>we</b> all <b>feel</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>we</b> think <b>that</b> you,--if I {{were to say}} {{take too}} much upon yourself, I should say, perhaps, more than we mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{suspected}} that," [...] said J. P. Huddle, [...] "and I think {{it gives us}} even more cause for annoyance. <b>We</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want a change of thrush at our time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt." ...|$|R
40|$|Whenever a postmortem is {{conducted}} {{we always have}} to opine about postmortem interval and when we do so <b>we</b> always <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have some better data so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can be more precise in answering this query. With this feeling in our minds we conducted this study and some interesting and important findings will be presented in this paper...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{unexpected}} {{sight of}} a face <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know, and yet cannot immediately recognise, is extremely annoying; it is almost agitating. They are English. The lady in black is Lady Madeleine Trevor; I knew her in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{she herself}} had no doubts, and was mollified by Mary's plea on her return. 'He is quite good now, but you see, {{there is so much}} danger of our spoiling him, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot begin too soon to make him obedient.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seems as}} if the awful nature of the place presses down upon the soul and hushes the {{beholder}} into noiseless reverence. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are surrounded by the congregated bones of the great men of past times, who have filled history with their deeds and the earth with their renown.|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{church is}} consecrated here to-day to duty and service, to {{the worship of}} the Creator, and to an earnest effort on our part so to shape our lives among {{ourselves}} and {{in relation to the}} outside world <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have done our part in ringing a little nearer the day when there shall be on this earth a genuine brotherhood of man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I can quite {{understand}} that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like <b>that,</b> I daresay. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> in England <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.|$|R
50|$|We {{were here}} at the very beginning, {{a group of people}} who had no {{experience}} dealing with this kind of a crisis, and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> rewarded <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have assisted so many people, in this difficult ‘journey’, with a great resilience and dedication. We take pride in our ongoing humanitarian work, especially our current involvement with the unaccompanied children and the families in need.|$|R
6000|$|... “Certainly,” said Elizabeth, whose earnestness was {{a little}} checked by female reserve. “The unfortunate would be welcome at any time, but doubly so when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have occasioned the evil ourselves,” “Yes,” said Richard, “and if you relish turkey, young man, there are plenty in the coops, and of the best kind, I can assure you.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No trouble now," [...] said Fortescue. [...] "We did have. But {{the public}} is getting educated up to it. Our law now allows us to knock the side out of a house when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would really like to}} see what is in it. We are not allowed, of course, to build it up again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{unless we}} see and know some one like Mr. Bentley," [...] he went on, {{choosing}} his words, [...] "or discover for ourselves what Christ was, and what he tried to tell us, we go on 'suffering, because we don't see any way out. We suffer because <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are useless, that other persons are doing our work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{can hardly}} be that, Macdonald," [...] the colonel said, [...] "though it is {{certainly}} curious <b>that</b> <b>we</b> seemed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew his face, {{when he came up}} before us. The young scamp could never have played such an audacious trick upon us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chua K'a Bodywork {{divides the}} body into 27 regions called zones of karma, {{each of which}} is {{associated}} with a particular fear or other psychic manifestation, whose memory is stored in these zones. For example, the fear of death may manifest as [...] "feeling weak in the knees"; our cheeks may go red with shame; our jaw may be clenched in revulsion; or <b>we</b> may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are carrying {{the weight of the world}} on our shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|Forrest and his wife, Nicola, made The Giving Pledge in 2013, stating: [...] "We hope to help empower {{individuals}} and families currently suffering the despair of poverty, slavery {{and the lack of}} opportunity for themselves and their children. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> all do whatever we can with whatever we have, large or small, then each of us will help make our world a more equitable and positive environment for others to thrive in." [...] Andrew and Nicola Forrest, February 2013 ...|$|R
60|$|Examine these similar {{actions as}} we will, we shall find them {{resulting}} solely from {{the spirit of}} the Perverse. We perpetrate them because <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct instigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you have}} an object; your aims are {{definite}} and you know, more or less, how to carry them out. We others, who have no purpose in life, spend our time in amusements that leave us dissatisfied. When we stop to think, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might do something better, but we don't know what it is. The outlook is blank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Boches are {{watching}} {{us like a}} cat watches a mouse, and we are equally on the alert," [...] wrote Dick Rover. [...] "There have been no big battles, but sniping is going on constantly, and several of our men have been killed or wounded. We are all anxious to have the cold weather break up, {{so that we can}} go forward and finish this war. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can wallop the enemy, if only {{we have a chance to}} get at them." ...|$|E
30|$|To date, {{our studies}} and the {{literature}} have not unambiguously identified a particular suture that will withstand both the vertical and the circumferential traction forces which normally occur within the knee, but <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the characteristics <b>we</b> have suggested and tested scientifically could provide {{the foundation for a}} successful technique.|$|R
5000|$|A week later, {{the group}} {{performed}} at G-A-Y, along with Diana Vickers. On {{the future as}} a band, Geneva said [...] "'We want to keep ourselves busy, we don’t want to fade. We hope to progress and become stronger. We are definitely staying together {{and are going to}} move in together at some point, we’re looking already. We want to experiment and really find ourselves, because <b>we</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to find our identity, so {{this is going to be}} good for us.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm always psyched {{and proud}} {{when we have}} {{finished}} an album recording, and this is no exception!" [...] said singer Grutle Kjellson. [...] "It was a really exciting process this time, with the line-up change and everything, so although it wasn't a dramatic change, the band dynamics were suddenly different. But, {{it was like a}} little re-boot, a fresh start so to speak. The studio sessions were great, and <b>we</b> all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have done something truly amazing. We hope you'll enjoy it." ...|$|R
