5|$|The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) {{reports in}} 2005, 2007, and 2008 found the {{reported}} outpatient waiting {{times to be}} unreliable because of data integrity concerns associated with VHA’s scheduling system., The discrepancies found by the OIG between requested appointment times documented in medical records and in the databases, and incomplete <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> are attributed to patient preference or the scheduler’s use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. Veterans Affairs officials warned the Obama-Biden transition team {{in the weeks after}} the 2008 presidential election that the department should not trust the wait times that its facilities were reporting.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Kerala {{became the}} first state in India to offer free cancer {{treatment}} to the poor, via a program called Sukrutham. People in Kerala experience elevated incidence of cancers, liver and kidney diseases. In April 2016, the Economic Times reported that 250,000 residents undergo treatment for cancer. It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region's hospitals annually. Approximately 42,000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually.

5000|$|<b>Wait</b> <b>lists</b> {{tend to be}} used by {{elite and}} {{selective}} universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, Stanford and Yale put 1,000 students on their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> and Duke put 3,000 on their <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> according to one report in 2010. Amherst takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> And as a general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> Of the students on a <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> at a highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission - [...] - as an average of all students <b>wait</b> <b>listed</b> in a given year - [...] - was 30%, but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades. <b>Wait</b> <b>listed</b> students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public.|$|R
5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} how {{the composition of}} the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for postmortem kidney transplant has developed, and whether the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> reflects actual demand. DESIGN: Retrospective research and cohort study. METHOD: We used data from the period 2000 - 2014 from the Dutch Transplant Foundation, 'RENINE' and Eurotransplant. This concerned data on postmortem kidney donation, live donor transplants, the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> and kidney transplantation. RESULTS: The postmortem kidney transplant <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> included transplantable (T) and non-transplantable (NT) patients. The number of T-patients declined from 1271 in 2000 to 650 in 2014, and the median waiting time between the start of dialysis and postmortem kidney transplant decreased from 4. 1 years in 2006 to 3. 1 years in 2014. The total number of patients on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> however, increased from 2263 in 2000 to 2560 in 2014 and in the same period the number of new patient registrations increased from 772 to 1212. In about 80 % of the NT-patients the reason for their NT status was not registered. A cohort analysis showed that NT-patients have a 2 -times lower chance of a postmortem kidney transplant and a 2 -times higher chance of leaving the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> without transplantation or of live-donor transplantation. CONCLUSION: The demand for donor kidneys remains high. The increased number of transplants resulted in a declining <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for T-patients while the total <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is getting longer. <b>Waiting</b> <b>list</b> registration and maintenance need to be improved, to give better insight into the real demand...|$|R

40|$|Background: In lung {{transplantation}} (LTx), {{allocation of}} donor lungs is usually based on blood group, height and waiting time. Long waiting times favor {{patients with a}} slowly progressive end-stage lung disease and make the current allocation system the subject of discussion. In an attempt to equalize the chances for transplantation for every patient, irrespective of diagnosis, we investigated the effect of diagnosis-dependent prioritization on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> using a simulation model. Methods: For the main disease categories on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> the relative risks of dying while on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were calculated using empirical data from the Dutch LTx program gathered {{over a period of}} 10 years. In a microsimulation model of the Dutch LTx program based on data from the actual situation, patients with diagnoses associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death while on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were prioritized by multiplying the time on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> by the relative risk. Results: Relative risks of death on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> were increased significantly in patients with cystic fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. Prioritization resulted in an increased chance of transplantation for the prioritized diagnoses and a decreased chance for the non-prioritized diagnoses. The distribution of diagnoses after LTx was almost equal to the distribution of diagnoses on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> Conclusion: The simulated method of prioritization on the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is a step forward to a more equitable allocation of donor lungs. Moreover, this method is clinically feasible, as long as the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> is updated frequently...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{assessment}} of pre and posttransplant {{quality of life}} is a current scientific target; it has not yet been carried out throughout the entire transplant process. Aims: 1) To analyze differences in mental health and quality of life at prewaiting <b>list</b> study, <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> and post transplant phases; 2) to analyze correlation between these quality of life and affective variables and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Methods: Two liver patient groups were recruited: 51 cirrhotic patients, who were assessed at two different stages (at pre <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> study and <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> phases), and 51 cadaveric liver transplant recipients; groups were homogeneous in gender and age variables by matching. Anxiety depressive symptomatology and quality of life were assessed by HADS and SF- 36 Health Survey, respectively. Results: Pre <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> study patients self perceived their global health status much worse than transplant recipients. <b>Waiting</b> <b>list</b> patients displayed much higher anxiety, more role limitations due to physical problems, worse physical functioning, as well as perceiving their global health status much worse than transplant recipients.

40|$|Background: One {{proposal}} to increase kidney transplantation is to exchange kidneys between pairs of ABO-incompatible (or crossmatch -incompatible) living donors and their recipients. One variation that has greater potential exchanges living donor kidneys for cadaveric donor kidneys (indirect exchanges). A primary concern with indirect exchanges {{is the potential}} to disadvantage blood group O <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. Using <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> modeling, we examine whether this proposal would disadvantage cadaveric kidney blood group O <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates, and present an approach for minimizing these negative effects. Methods: A probability model estimated the total number and blood type frequencies of donor-recipient pairs that would participate in indirect exchanges. A supply-to-demand model for the cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> estimated the mean wait time under different allocation policies and donor selection mechanisms for candidates on the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> classified according to the candidates' race and blood type. Results: Indirect exchanges will reduce the mean wait time for cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. The mean wait time of blood group O cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates increases when the participating living donors self-select and when kidney allocation is determined by efficiency. This is neutralized when the transplant team preferentially selects blood group O living donors and cadaveric kidney allocation is determined by need. Conclusion: Indirect exchange programs will significantly shorten the wait times for cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. The <b>wait</b> times of blood group O candidates will not be affected adversely if blood group O living donors are selected preferentially and if allocation is based on need. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypochondriasis is a {{distressing}} disorder {{for which}} there is no adequate established treatment. This study evaluates the effect of cognitive-behavioural treatment of hypochondriasis, compared with a <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> control. METHOD: Thirty-two patients were randomly assigned to either cognitive-behavioural therapy or a no treatment <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> control. Cognitive-behavioural treatment consisted of 16 individual treatment sessions over a four-month period.
