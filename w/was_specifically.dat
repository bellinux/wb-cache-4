His jersey number 9 was retired on January 18, 2009, by the Oilers, before a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. The date for Anderson's number retirement <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> selected because his former Oilers teammates, Wayne Gretzky and Grant Fuhr, were serving as the Coyotes' head coach and goaltending coach respectively at the time.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{had long}} {{intended}} to architecturally reconstruct the German capital Berlin {{into a new}} imperial metropolis, which he decided in 1942 to rename Germania upon its scheduled completion in 1950. The name <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> chosen {{to make it the}} clear central point of the envisioned Germanic empire, and to re-enforce the notion of a united Germanic-Nordic state upon the Germanic peoples of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it had its}} own {{branch line}} into Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route of the}} London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Tools entered {{development}} in August 2005 under the code name White Engine. It {{was intended for}} the then PlayStation 3-exclusive role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII. The decision to expand Crystal Tools' compatibility to other game projects and systems marked the official project start for a company-wide engine. Development {{was carried out by}} the Research and Development Division headed by Taku Murata, which <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> established for this purpose. As Square Enix's biggest project to date, the creation of Crystal Tools caused substantial problems in the simultaneous production of several flagship titles; various critics cited the engine as the primary cause of significant delays in the release of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E
5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned floor tiles.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recently}} signed a two-year extension to his BBC staff writer's contract, Nigel Kneale <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> commissioned {{to write a}} sequel to The Quatermass Experiment in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the Official Secrets Act. As with The Quatermass Experiment, Quatermass II was produced and directed by Rudolph Cartier; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first Quatermass serial, {{the two men had}} collaborated on the literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954), and on Kneale's abominable snowman play The Creature (1955).|$|E

5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, {{performed}} four dives in two days. Its key aims were {{to assess the}} current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic were also a key focus of investigation. The second expedition, from 27 May– 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and stereoscopic still images.|$|E
5|$|Led by Wing Commander Lou Spence, No.77 Squadron was {{committed}} to action over Korea as part of United Nations Command, and came under the operational control of the US Fifth Air Force. The Australian unit <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> requested by General Douglas MacArthur, commander of UN forces; the Mustang was considered the best long-range ground-attack aircraft in the theatre, and Stratemeyer contended that No.77 Squadron was the best Mustang outfit in Japan. The squadron flew its initial escort and patrol sorties from Iwakuni on 2July 1950, becoming the first non-American UN unit to commence operations. Several Australian families were still living at Iwakuni pending their repatriation from what had become an operational theatre, and could watch the Mustangs depart for missions over Korea.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1791, he had {{to resign}} his {{position}} in the Commission of National Education to take an appointment (Minister of Police) in the newly created government, the Guard of Laws. From March 1792 he also held the position of Minister of War. During the War in the Defence of the Constitution in 1792 he went on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to Berlin to request assistance from the Prussian government. On 4 July 1792 a sudden depression made him resign his ministerial positions. A vocal opponent of the Targowica Confederation and likely an author of an anonymous anti-Targowica brochure, he <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> requested by the Russian government to not {{be involved in the}} negotiations; he also refused to join the Targowica Confederation, even after Poniatowski's accession to it.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is {{also one}} of the first games that uses the Havok's HydraCore physics engine, which <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> {{designed}} for multi-core video game systems such as the Xbox 360. The game's renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the previous console generation, including parallax mapping, ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, and high dynamic range. The soundtrack of the game was primarily composed by David Clynick, who worked with Grant Kirkhope on the original Nintendo 64 game's score. New York based group MorissonPoe contributed two songs to the score, while DJs Kepi and Kat composed the game's nightclub theme.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{fighting}} in ice hockey, fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse. Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection, but incur a five-minute major penalty. In CLA (Canadian Lacrosse Association) play, players are assessed a five-minute major penalty plus a game misconduct. Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions. In 1990, when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league, fighting <b>was</b> <b>specifically</b> targeted as unacceptable. Violators were {{ejected from the}} game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension.|$|E
