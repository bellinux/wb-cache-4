5|$|Rodriguez and Tarantino each {{acted as}} cinematographer on their segments. Although Rodriguez had {{previously}} worked as the cinematographer on {{six of his}} own feature films, Death Proof marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the SS was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked <b>with</b> <b>on</b> The Devil's Rejects.

5|$|After {{leaving his}} former label Flying Dutchman Records, Gil Scott-Heron {{signed with the}} New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, {{accompanied}} by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, {{with whom he had}} worked <b>with</b> <b>on</b> his previous studio albums, Pieces of a Man (1971) and Free Will (1972). While some sources allege this may have been over financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintained the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R and soul music listeners, particularly for the political and social nature of their music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time.|$|E

In McAfee, CR 517 intersects with Route 94 and the two routes head east for a short wrong way concurrency, crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway before CR 517 turns to the south.

5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found {{the opportunity to do}} so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated <b>with</b> <b>on</b> her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of the}} musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked <b>with</b> <b>on</b> his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E

In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989.

However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector.

5|$|In 2009, Microsoft Studios {{launched}} Halo Wars, a real-time strategy spin-off to {{the first-person}} shooter video game series Halo. The game {{was developed by}} Microsoft subsidiary Ensemble Studios. While Halo Wars was a commercial success, Ensemble Studios was shut down upon completion of its development. Prior to its closure, Ensemble had started writing a script and laying the narrative groundwork for a sequel. According to Halo Wars lead writer Graeme Devine, this original script explored {{the history of the}} Forerunners and involved the Spirit of Fire arriving at a Forerunner station that Anders had tracked. In 2007, Microsoft formed an internal division named 343 Industries to oversee and develop products in the Halo franchise. While the division had intentions of creating a follow-up to Halo Wars, they refrained from doing so until they found the right developer to partner <b>with</b> <b>on</b> the project. They viewed working with other developers and using external experience as a significant part of maintaining quality across their numerous projects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping the clocks in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline for the end of the session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin <b>with.</b> <b>On</b> July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E
