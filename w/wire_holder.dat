6000|$|That evening, as Janet was {{wiping the}} dishes handed {{her by her}} mother, she was repeating to herself [...] "Shall I go--or shan't I?"--just as if the matter were in doubt. But in her heart she was {{convinced}} of its predetermination by some power other than her own volition. With this feeling, that she really had no choice, {{that she was being}} guided and impelled, she went to her bedroom after finishing her task. The hands of the old dining-room clock pointed to quarter of eight, and Lise had already made her toilet and departed. Janet opened the wardrobe, looked at the new blue suit hanging so neatly on its <b>wire</b> <b>holder,</b> hesitated, and closed the door again. Here, at any rate, seemed a choice. She would not wear that, to-night. She tidied her hair, put on her hat and coat, and went out; but once in the street she did not hurry, though she knew the calmness she apparently experienced to be false: the calmness of fatality, because she was obeying a complicated impulse stronger than herself--an impulse that at times seemed mere curiosity. Somewhere, removed from her immediate consciousness, a storm was raging; she was aware of a disturbance that reached her faintly, like the distant throbbing of the looms she heard when she turned from Faber into West Street She {{had not been able to}} eat any supper. That throbbing of the looms in the night! As it grew louder and louder the tension within her increased, broke its bounds, set her heart to throbbing too--throbbing wildly. She halted, and went on again, precipitately, but once more slowed her steps as she came to West Street and the glare of light at the end of the bridge; at a little distance, under the chequered shadows of the bare branches, she saw something move--a man, Ditmar. She stood motionless as he hurried toward her.|$|E

30|$|The {{deployment}} unit {{consists of}} two parts: a sphere holder and a motor box. The sphere holder keeps the sphere using a launch lock with three latching arms. The motor box contains a <b>wire</b> <b>holder,</b> a stepping motor, a gear box, and a latch-release mechanism, and is driven by MWE (MAST-WPT-E, MAST, and WPT Electronics) in PWE-E. As {{the first step of}} the deployment operation, the launch lock is released by the initial rotation of the <b>wire</b> <b>holder</b> driven by the stepping motor. Next, the wire is deployed in three steps, i.e., 5, 10  m, and full (15  m).|$|E
50|$|In {{high voltage}} systems {{containing}} transformers and capacitors, liquid insulator oil is the typical method used for preventing arcs. The oil replaces air in spaces that must support significant voltage without electrical breakdown. Other high voltage system insulation materials include ceramic or glass <b>wire</b> <b>holders,</b> gas, vacuum, and simply placing wires far enough apart to use air as insulation.|$|R
50|$|The board-style {{cheese slicer}} has been {{expanded}} to include marble, stainless steel, and plastic cutting boards. Several other designs of handles and <b>wire</b> <b>holders</b> have also been invented to hold the cutting wires of cheese slicing boards. Many of these wires have loops on the ends like the Prodyne models; others have small rings or knots that fit into a slot on the handle and cutting arm.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{corrugated}} hoses can {{be manufactured}} {{by a special}} method that {{is closely related to}} the manufacture of stripwound hoses. In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a braided sheath (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has circumferential <b>wire</b> coil <b>holders,</b> or so-called bobbins.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWire {{electrical}} discharge turning (WEDT) {{is suitable}} for machining of precise cylindrical forms on hard and difficult-to-cut materials. In WEDT electrical discharge takes place between the traveling wire and the rotating workpiece to be machined. However, {{in many cases the}} machining efficiency of WEDT is considered to be rather low. One of the methods to enlarge the application envelope of WEDT and to improve its machining performance on difficult-to-machine materials is introduction of ultrasonic vibration to the wire electrode. An investigation has been made to combine ultrasonic vibration and wire electrical discharge turning. Design of a submerged, precise, flexible and corrosion-resistant rotary spindle is introduced. The spindle was mounted on a five-axis wire EDM machine to rotate the workpiece in order to generate free form cylindrical geometries. An auxiliary device which produces ultrasonic vibration was installed between the two wire-guides. The ultrasonic system consists of an ultrasonic generator, a transducer and a <b>wire</b> <b>holder.</b> When the wire is being driven, the transducer together with the <b>wire</b> <b>holder</b> vibrate under the resonance condition. Material removal rate (MRR) indicates efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process. Experimental results show that wire vibration induced by ultrasonic action has a significant effect on material removal rate. This study has been to evaluate the influence of four design factors: power, pulse off time, spindle rotational speed and ultrasonic vibration over material removal rate. This has been done by means of design of experiments (DOE) technique. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant effective factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{transverse}} {{profile of the}} circulating beam of the CERN PS is obtained from {{the interaction between the}} particles and a thin wire rapidly moving throuqh It. The slqnal from a secondary particles monitor or the secondary emission current of the wire is sampled against the wire position every four beam revolutions in the macblne. A stand-alone desk compu-ter performs the real-time control of the wire displa-cement as well as the acqulsit,ions and calculations necessary to display the profiles and the corres-pondlnc ~ emlttances. A traversing speed of 20 m/s in the measurement area is reached, using a high torque motor riqldly lilked to a II shaped <b>wire</b> <b>holder.</b> All elements are carefully designed and chosen for low inertia and minimum load on the wire.

5|$|The Joseph F. Glidden House {{is located}} in the United States in the DeKalb County, Illinois city of DeKalb. It was the home to the famed {{inventor}} of barbed wire Joseph Glidden. The barn, still located on the property near several commercial buildings, is said to be where Glidden perfected his improved version of barbed wire which would eventually transform him into a successful entrepreneur. The Glidden House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The home was designed by another barbed <b>wire</b> patent <b>holder</b> in DeKalb, Jacob Haish.|$|R

Cast iron hymnal racks with hoops to hold walking canes are {{on the backs of}} the pews; and original <b>wire</b> hat <b>holders</b> for gentlemen’s hat can be found under certain pews. A balcony was added in 1911, which was larger than the present balcony. About that same time, the level floor of the church was made to slope to give people in the back of the sanctuary a better view.|$|R

A resistance-heating tungsten <b>wire</b> sample <b>holder</b> of a TEM was used to heat the nanowire encapsulated within MWCNTs up to 1, 550 °C in vacuum with an accuracy of ± 50 °C depending on the sample position [15].|$|R
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or <b>wire)</b> into the <b>holder</b> (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|R
3000|$|... 2 −. Therefore, our {{measurements}} reflected {{changes in}} the ‘anionic’ concentration rather than in Cl− fluctuations. An Ag/AgCl <b>wire</b> electrode <b>holder</b> (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was inserted {{into the back of}} the microelectrode in order to establish electrical contact with the bathing solution. The ground electrode was a dry reference (DRIREF- 2, World Precision Instruments) that was inserted into the sample bath. In order to obtain a calibration line, microelectrodes were calibrated at the beginning and end of each experiment using standard solutions covering the experimental range of each ion. Both the slope and intercept of the calibration line were used to calculate the respective ion concentration from the mV values measured during the experiment near and distant from the root surface. A detailed description of the ion-selective vibrating probe system was reported by Feijó et al. [8] and Ramos et al [25, 26]. The vibrating-electrode system was attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE- 300 inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) and housed inside a copper-sheet Faraday cage over a vibration-free platform. For routine experiments, an X 20 Plan Apo objective under differential interference contrast (DIC) was used.|$|R
40|$|Meter Company's N- 2 ARPS-A 6, Style D power {{supplies}}. When manufactured, {{the power}} supplies utilized Thomas and Betts TC 105 A aluminum <b>wire</b> tie <b>holders</b> in random numbers and placements. As the power supplies age, the tie wrap holder adhesive degrades and the tie wraps embrittle {{resulting in the}} separation of the tie wraps and loss of holder adhesion to the power supply enclosure. This causes the wraps and holders to fall {{to the bottom of the}} enclosure which could result in shorts when the aluminum comes in contact with electronic components. In one particular power supply, all tie wrap holders in use failed and separated from the enclosure. The power supplies are used in Foxboro SPEC- 200 cabinetry that are used throughout the industry. At the time of this notification, Integrated Resources has one power supply from Three Mile Island and two power supplies from Ft. Calhoun undergoing refurbishment. Integrated Resources will be following up this telephonic notification with a written report once their internal investigation is done. * Recommended corrective actions are for affected facilities to open and inspect all power supplies and remove the aluminum tie wrap holders and replace the tie wraps and holders with Teflon types...|$|R
5000|$|Wire is versatile, {{and wire}} clothes hangers {{are often used}} as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more {{available}} than baling wire {{for all sorts of}} home projects. The use of wire clothes hangers for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years. Similarly, many similar do-it-yourself and children's projects use <b>wire</b> hangers as <b>holders</b> of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work, to securing a gate on a bird cage. The much-loved 'Advent Crown' made for children's TV programme Blue Peter was made from four wire coathangers. Coathangers {{can be used to make}} dowsing rods. After sanding, wire hangers also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot wiring cars to games [...] to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat hangers as replacement car radio antennas. Clothes hangers are also commonly used as an implement for roasting marshmallows or hot dogs at camp-outs.|$|R
40|$|Superconducting magnets {{based on}} Nb- 3 Sn {{technology}} {{are being developed}} for the LHC high luminosity upgrade. In this context, irradiation induced changes of the superconducting properties of state-of-the-art Ti and Ta doped Nb- 3 Sn wires are presently studied. During irradiation tests with protons of 65 MeV at the cyclotron of Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), 1. 4 GeV at the CERN ISOLDE facility, and 24 GeV at the CERN IRRAD 1 facility, the superconductor samples become radioactive and their handling must follow the legal specifications for radioactive materials. We have estimated the activation and the resulting ambient dose equivalent rate up to a fluence of 10 17 p/cm 2 with the Monte-Carlo Code FLUKA. The estimates were verified with experimental activation spectra. Samples for magnetization measurements with a mass of approximately 20 mg {{have to be considered}} as radioactive, but {{they do not have the}} potential to harm the operators handling them at radiation levels below 1 μSv/h. Larger samples (longer <b>wires</b> and sample <b>holder</b> materials like Cu and TiAl 6 V 4) show correspondingly higher ambient dose equivalent rates and activation levels and they must be handled by radiation workers in designated areas, taking into account the standard precautions for work with radioactive materials. The use of radiation shielding during handling is recommended. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|The {{growth of}} {{tungsten}} oxide nanorods {{was conducted by}} heating a tungsten wire in an oxygen atmosphere inside an environmental TEM. The commercially obtained pure tungsten wire (wire diameter, 25 μm; purity, 99.99 %; The Nilaco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) {{was used as the}} primary material for the tungsten oxide nanorods, and the heater, for the wire-heated environmental TEM sample holder, which enabled the introduction of gas into the environmental TEM. The holder was equipped with electrodes and the gas-introducing nozzle; the tungsten wire was connected between the electrodes and heated by current being applied to the wire. The measurement of the temperature of the heated wire was attempted using both a thermocouple and radiation thermometer. However, due to the small size of the wire, the thermocouple could not touch the wire. Furthermore, the measurement area of a radiation thermometer is larger than the wire diameter; therefore, space and material other than the wire was included in the measurement area. As a result, the wire temperature could not be measured by either the thermocouple or the radiation thermometer. Consequently, the wire temperature was measured using the following method. First, a pure metal powder with a known melting point was set on the connected <b>wire.</b> Secondly, the <b>holder</b> was introduced into the environmental TEM and the wire was heated. Then, the current was recorded when the metal powder melted; the same procedure was repeated with other metal powders. Finally, the temperature at which each metal melted was plotted on a current-temperature graph. This graph allowed us to determine the wire temperature without a thermocouple or radiation thermometer. The sample-heating holder was inserted in the environmental TEM, and the pressure in the environmental TEM was regulated by flow-rate control of the injected oxygen gas through the nozzle. The tungsten oxide nanorods grew after the current flowed through the tungsten wire. The environmental TEM {{used in the present study}} was made by HITACHI (H- 9000 NAR, Tokyo, Japan) and was equipped with a Gatan imaging filter [GIF] (Tokyo, Japan), a CCD, and a camera. This machine was operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. The GIF was used to determine the elemental maps and electron energy loss spectra of the samples, and the dynamic growth behavior of the samples was recorded by the camera. The growth conditions used were as follows: the wire temperature was 800 °C, and the oxygen pressure in the environmental TEM was 1.0 × 10 - 4 Pa. These growth conditions were applied for all the samples grown. Moreover, the existence and shape of the grown material on the wire were observed by scanning electron microscopy [SEM] (HITACHI, S- 4300). The wire was removed from the TEM holder for the SEM observations. In thick crystalline tungsten, it is difficult to observe the natural surface oxide layer on the wire and the behavior of the interface between the nanorods and wire due to the difficulty of the transmission of electrons for TEM analyses. In this case, a part of the tungsten wire was fabricated into a thin film, in which electrons can transmit through, by a focused ion beam [FIB] (JEM- 9320 FIB, JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). The FIB was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.|$|R
