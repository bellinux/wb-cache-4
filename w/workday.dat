40|$|OBJECTIVES: Back pain is {{the most}} common reason for filing workers' {{compensation}} claims and often causes lost <b>workdays.</b> Data from the 1988 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed to identify high-risk industries and to estimate the prevalence of work-related back pain and number of <b>workdays</b> lost. METHODS: Analyses included 30074 respondents who worked during the 12 months before the interview. A case patient was defined as a respondent who had back pain every day for a week or more during that period. RESULTS: The prevalence of lost-workday back pain was 4. 6 %, and individuals with work-related cases lost 101. 8 million <b>workdays</b> owing to back pain. Male and female case patients lost about the same number of <b>workdays.</b> Industries in high-risk categories were also identified for future research and intervention, including those seldom studied. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides statistically reliable national estimates of the prevalence of back pain among workers and the enormous effect of this condition on American industry in terms of lost <b>workdays...</b>|$|R

Methods: Data are from the Brazilian Institute of Social Insurance, for 2006. The study population is comprised of all insured workers of age 16 – 24. Descriptive statistics reflect <b>workdays</b> lost due to health-related disability, according to sex, age group, wage, and trade. Results: Out of 4. 8 million insured workers ages 16 – 24 years, we estimated 1, 282, 940 <b>workdays</b> lost. We observed {{a larger number of}} median <b>workdays</b> lost among males age 20 – 24 in retail and service trades (83 days) and among 16 – 19 -year-old females in the agriculture/fish/forestry/cattle (142 days).

The present study was designed to assess the short term effects of smoking on hospitalisation and lost <b>workdays.</b>  DESIGN—Retrospective cohort study.  SETTING—Military population.  SUBJECTS— 87   991 men and women serving on active duty in the US Army during 1987  to 1998  who took a health risk appraisal two or more times and were followed for an average of 2. 4  years.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Rate ratios for hospitalisations and lost <b>workdays,</b> and fraction of hospitalisations and lost <b>workdays</b> attributable to current smoking (population attributable fraction).  RESULTS—Compared with never smokers, men and women who were current smokers had higher short term rates of hospitalisation and lost <b>workdays</b> for a broad range of conditions. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for outcomes not related to injury or pregnancy were 7. 5 % (men) and 5. 0 % (women) for hospitalisation, and 14. 1 % (men) and 3. 0 % (women) for lost <b>workdays.</b> Evidence suggests that current smoking may have been under reported in this cohort, in which case the true PAFs would be higher than those reported.  CONCLUSIONS—In this young healthy population, substantial fractions of hospitalisations and lost <b>workdays</b> were attributable to current smoking, particularly among men.    Keywords: young men; hospitalisation; lost workdays; employer...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{determine}} day-to-day differences in cortisol levels and the molar cortisol-to-dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ratio (molar C/D ratio) in working subjects. Materials and Methods: The cortisol and DHEA levels were measured from saliva samples collected 30 minutes after awakening for 7 consecutive days in full-time working subjects that worked Monday through Saturday. To determine the day-to-day differences within subjects, the collected data was analyzed using variance (ANOVA) for a randomized complete block design (RCBD). Results: The cortisol levels from samples collected 30 minutes after awakening on <b>workdays</b> were similar to each other, but were {{significantly different from the}} cortisol levels on Sunday. The DHEA levels were not significantly different between the days of week. The DHEA levels on Monday and Tuesday were relatively lower than the levels on the other weekdays. The DHEA levels on Thursday and Friday were relatively higher than the other days. The molar C/D ratios on Sunday were significantly lower than those on <b>workdays.</b> The molar C/D ratios on Monday and Tuesday were significantly higher than those on Wednesday or other <b>workdays.</b> Conclusion: The cortisol levels and the molar C/D ratios demonstrate differences in adrenocortical activities between <b>workdays</b> and non-workdays, but the molar C/D ratio additionally represents differences in adrenocortical status between the first two <b>workdays</b> and other <b>workdays.</b> Thus, {{it is possible that the}} day-to-day differences in the cortisol levels and the molar C/D ratio represent the adrenal response to upcoming work-related stress...|$|R
