40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{conducted}} {{a detailed analysis of}} protocols used for connecting to wireless networks. <b>First</b> <b>we</b> studies the procedure of registering to open networks and then to networks protected with various algorithms. With all procedures we examined the messages that are exchanged when registering to a certain network and we checked the security risks involved. The main emphasis was given to open networks with subsequent requests for registering. <b>First</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to know these networks; we examined what they are like, what they have to offer and where we could find them. Next we checked the security. We tried to intercept a password and avoid registering. In some cases we succeeded, which proves that such networks do not provide a high level of security and that one should be careful when using them...|$|R
60|$|It was in {{watching}} {{the movements of}} Le Cerf, that <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> a glimpse of La Désirée. This ship reappeared almost in a line with her consort; and, like her, steering off before the wind. Their common object seemed to be, to get within close supporting distance of each other, and to increase the space between them and their enemies. Both these vessels had the tri-colored flag flying at the stumps of their masts. As respects the last, however, La Désirée was a little better off than her consort--having her foremast and main-mast standing entire;--though her mizen-mast was gone, close to the deck. What was a very bad affair for her, her fore-yard had been shot away in the slings, the two inner ends lying on the forecastle, while the yard-arms were loosely sustained by the lifts. This ship kept off under her main-sail and fore-stay-sail.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{occasion}} when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> on speaking terms on the road by the quarry, I {{had to admit that}} she presented some points of a problematic appearance. I don't know why I imagined Captain Anthony as the sort of man who would not be likely to take the initiative; not perhaps from indifference but from that peculiar timidity before women which often enough is found in conjunction with chivalrous instincts, with a great need for affection and great stability of feelings. Such men are easily moved. At the least encouragement they go forward with the eagerness, with the recklessness of starvation. This accounted for the suddenness of the affair. No! With all her inexperience this girl could not have found any great difficulty in her conquering enterprise. She must have begun it. And yet there she was, patient, almost unmoved, almost pitiful, waiting outside like a beggar, without a right to anything but compassion, for a promised dole.|$|E

He was called Lopez, and he was descended from the ancient Mexicans and was very black. He was a cowherd in the ranges beyond Carmel, and his wife was a maidservant in the great Del Monte Hotel. It was seven years before <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> {{in touch with the}} Los Ange-litos. They have a good country down there, but it is too warm. I {{estimate}} the present population of the world at between three hundred and fifty and four hundred--provided, of course, that there are no scattered little tribes elsewhere in the world. If there be such, we have not heard from them. Since Johnson crossed the desert from Utah, no word nor sign has come from the East or anywhere else. The great world which I knew in my boyhood and early manhood is gone. It has ceased to be. I am the last man who was alive {{in the days of the}} plague and who knows the wonders of that far-off time. We, who mastered the planet--its earth, and sea, and sky--and who were as very gods, now live in primitive savagery along the water courses of this California country.|$|E
5000|$|The Adolescents' Blue Album lineup reunited in 2001 {{to play a}} {{birthday}} party for Reflex's wife. Over {{the next few years}} the band played sporadically, including opening for Bad Religion at a benefit for Flipside and a headlining slot at Los Angeles' Galaxy Theater, but always as a revival act. Royer soon left and was replaced by Derek O'Brien, formerly of Social Distortion, D.I., and Agent Orange. Encouraged by the response to their reunion shows, Reflex suggested that the band start writing new material. Frank Agnew remarked that [...] "When we were in Soto's apartment, it reminded me a lot of when <b>we</b> very <b>first</b> <b>got</b> together. The three of us—the three original members who were putting songs together in Tony's garage—it almost had the same nostalgic vibe, sitting around and throwing out ideas." [...] The Adolescents issued an EP titled Unwrap and Blow Me! in 2003, limited to 100 copies and consisting of six new songs: [...] "Hawks and Doves", [...] "Where the Children Play", [...] "California Son", [...] "OC Confidential", [...] "Pointless Teenage Anthem", and [...] "Within These Walls". A live album and concert film, Live at the House of Blues, was recorded that October and featured performances of [...] "OC Confidential", [...] "California Son", [...] "Hawks and Doves", [...] "Within These Walls", and another new song, [...] "Lockdown America".|$|R
40|$|A Markov chain based {{classification}} {{model is}} employed in out program, called SUMMs (Spectrogram Unit Markov Models system). <b>First,</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{a set of}} cluster models by doing cluster analysis on a corpus of spectrogram feature vectors extracted from a large collection of unlabeled songs, and build a codebook from these models. Then, for labeled songs, we extract their feature vectors and map the vectors to appropriate codes according to the codebook, thus converting songs into code sequences. Later we use code sequences of songs to train Markov chains for each song. The models are used to evaluate distances between songs. 1. Datasets There are two datasets need to be specified. The first dataset, called CBDS, is used to generate the codebook. The audio tracks of this dataset are gathered from the Internet, hopefully covering all the main genres and moods of western music...|$|R

"No, {{there was}} not much light left; besides, as I have not seen him for the last eight years, I should {{certainly}} not be able to recognize him unless I had time to have a good look at him. Had it only been last night's affair it might have been anyone; but the shooting through the window was not the act of a thief, but of an assassin, who could only have been influenced by private enmity. I quite see that at present I have no legal evidence against. Bastow; I am not even in a position to prove that he is in the country, for it cannot be said that my father's belief that he recognized the voice of the man who said 'Stand and deliver!' is proof. I doubt if anyone could swear that, when he only heard three words, he was absolutely sure that it was the voice of a man he had not seen for some years. However, fortunately, that will make no difference; the man is, as I told you, wanted for his heading the mutiny in the convict prison at Sydney, which will be quite sufficient to hang him without this business. But I own that I should prefer that he were hung for my father's murder if we could secure sufficient evidence. Moreover, there is the attack upon us three or four months ago, and with the evidence of the surgeon who attended him as to his wound, that would be enough to hang him. But <b>we</b> have <b>first</b> <b>got</b> to catch him, and that I mean to make my business, however long the search may take me." ...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding my misanthropy I {{had to see}} a {{few people}} on account of all these Royalist affairs which I couldn’t very well drop, and in truth {{did not wish to}} drop. They were my excuse for {{remaining}} in Europe, which somehow I had not the strength of mind to leave for the West Indies, or elsewhere. On the other hand, my adventurous pursuit kept me in contact with the sea where I found occupation, protection, consolation, the mental relief of grappling with concrete problems, the sanity one acquires from close contact with simple mankind, a little self-confidence born from the dealings with the elemental powers of nature. I couldn’t give all that up. And besides all this was related to Doña Rita. I had, as it were, received it all from her own hand, from that hand the clasp of which was as frank as a man’s and yet conveyed a unique sensation. The very memory of it would go through me like a wave of heat. It was over that hand that <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> into the habit of quarrelling, with the irritability of sufferers from some obscure pain and yet half unconscious of their disease. Rita’s own spirit hovered over the troubled waters of Legitimity. But as {{to the sound of the}} four magic letters of her name I was not very likely to hear it fall sweetly on my ear. For instance, the distinguished personality in the world of finance with whom I had to confer several times, alluded to the irresistible seduction of the power which reigned over my heart and my mind; which had a mysterious and unforgettable face, the brilliance of sunshine together with the unfathomable splendour of the night as—Madame de Lastaola. That’s how that steel-grey man called the greatest mystery of the universe. When uttering that assumed name he would make for himself a guardedly solemn and reserved face as though he were afraid lest I should presume to smile, lest he himself should venture to smile, and the sacred formality of our relations should be outraged beyond mending.|$|E
