500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, London trained at several wrestling schools, {{including}} a trailer park in West Memphis, Arkansas and a school run by Ivan Putski in North Austin, Texas. He debuted in 2000.. London made his first appearance at WCW Greed on March 18 2001 as an audience member during the Diamond Dallas Page and Scott Steiner WCW World Heavyweight Championship match. He later enrolled in Shawn Michaels' wrestling school, the Texas Wrestling Academy, where he was trained by Rudy Gonzales. Early in his career, London made brief appearances in Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Zero-One (Zero1) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). London competed in Zero1 for several months on a match-by-match basis, beginning in January 2003, before turning down a contract. London was contacted by TNA after ROH's one-year anniversary show, and told that {{they were interested in}} him doing some matches on a try-out basis. On February 12, 2003, he made his TNA debut in a Gauntlet match against Jerry Lynn, which he lost. London competed mainly in the company's X Division, even earning shots at the NWA TNA X Division Championship. His last appearance in TNA was on June 18, 2003, at the TNA Anniversary show.

500|$|In August 1996, {{the band}} {{performed}} two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates {{were to be}} the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised {{it would not be}} possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an MTV Unplugged performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, The Sun led with the front page headline [...] "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." [...] Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted [...] "If the truth be known, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> anyway. I wasn't prepared to be in the band if people were being like that to each other." ...|$|E

The band ceased being active following the 1999-2000 tour {{in support of the}} California record, although their disbandment was only officially confirmed in November of 2004. Patton explained to Rolling Stone [...] "I'm at a point now where I crave healthy musical environments, where there is a genuine exchange of ideas without repressed envy or resentment, and where people in the band <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> regardless of what public accolades may come their way.

He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
