50|$|The lake {{is known}} for the large <b>wels</b> <b>catfishes.</b> It is {{believed}} that {{the depths of the}} lake are inhabited by the gigantic catfishes, up to 3 m long with the weight of over 100 kg. Such a large specimens have not been caught yet and in July 2017 a divers were employed to explore the part of the lake. The waters of the lake are murky and at the depths of 5 to 6 m, the visibility is zero. The divers reached 15 m, but didn't discover such a large fishes, though few days before the dive, a specimen 1.86 m long which weighted 37 kg have been caught near the mouth of the Boranja river. Since 1998, an annual catfish hunt festivity Somovijada, has been held. The heaviest fish caught in the lake measured 87 kg.|$|R
25|$|The <b>wels</b> <b>catfish's</b> mouth {{contains}} {{lines of}} numerous small teeth, two long barbels {{on the upper}} jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw. It has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin, and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward. It relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey, but its eyes have a tapetum lucidum, providing the advantage of night vision, {{contrary to popular belief}} that the wels has poor eyesight. With its sharp pectoral fins, it creates an eddy to disorient its victim, which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole. The skin is very slimy. Skin colour varies with environment. Clear water will give the fish a black color, while muddy water will often tend to produce green-brown specimens. The underside is always pale yellow to white in colour. Albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally. The wels swims by undulating its long, muscular tail in a wave-like action, similar to crocodilians. They can also swim backwards.|$|R

40|$|Since {{globalization}} have {{promoted the}} ornamental trade and accelerated {{the movement of}} freshwater fishes around the world, non-native species pose a high potential to be released into local freshwater habitats, and to spread and establish as invasive and nuisance species with adverse ecological, economic and social impacts. This study aimed to investigate {{the potential of the}} ornamental freshwater fish trade as an invasion pathway in Hong Kong, assess the ecological risk of common aquarium freshwater fish species being traded in the local market, identify species of concern and recommend ways for their management with a view to minimizing biological invasion risk associated with the aquarium trade. Based on a series of systematic market surveys through visiting 46 major aquarium shops in Hong Kong, about 167 freshwater fish species were found in the local aquarium trade between summer 2012 and spring 2013. Twenty-five species were randomly selected to go through two standard ecological risk assessment protocols (i. e., FISK & IFRA). The assessment results indicated that the goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) and <b>Wel’s</b> <b>catfish</b> (Silurus glanis) have a high invasive risk in Hong Kong. The ornamental trade is one of the significant sources of freshwater fish invasions in Hong Kong. An integrated invasive species management plan is recommended to apply and implement in Hong Kong. The key elements of this management plan include (1) development of law and regulation on invasive species, (2) establishment of an early detection programme (like the current study), (3) implementation of control and eradication measures, (4) setting up invasive species handling guidelines and (5) fostering public education programs on biological invasion prevention. The plan should involve the participation of all stakeholders, such as government, industry, social community organization and public in order to engage them to jointly effectively tackle and manage invasive species and thereby conserve Hong Kong’s aquatic biodiversity. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> (Siluris glanis).

25|$|Like most {{freshwater}} bottom feeders, the <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> {{lives on}} annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans, and fish. Larger specimens {{have been observed}} to eat frogs, mice, rats, aquatic birds such as ducks and can also be cannibalistic. According to a study published {{by researchers at the}} University of Toulouse, France in 2012, individuals of this species in environments outside of their normal habitats have been observed lunging out of the water to feed on pigeons on land. Out of all beaching behaviors observed and filmed in this study, 28% of them were successful in bird capture. Stable isotope analyses of catfish stomach contents using carbon 13 and nitrogen 15 revealed a highly variable dietary composition of terrestrial birds. This is likely the result of adapting their behavior to forage on novel prey in response to new environments upon its introduction to the Tarn River in 1983 since this type of behavior has not been reported before within the native range of this species.|$|E

2500|$|Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are {{a diverse}} group of ray-finned fish.

There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby.
