60|$|George Stephenson {{was born}} in June, 1781, {{the son of a}} fireman who tended the pumping engine of the {{neighbouring}} colliery, and one of a penniless family of six children. So poor was his father, indeed, that the whole household lived in a single room, with bare floor and mud wall; and little Geordie grew up in his own unkempt fashion without any schooling whatever, not even knowing A from B when he was a big lad of seventeen. At an age when he ought to have been learning his letters, he was bird's-nesting in the fields or running errands to the Wylam shops; {{and as soon as he}} was old enough to earn a few pence by light work, he was set to tend cows at the magnificent wages of twopence a day, in the village of Dewley Burn, close by, to which his father had then removed. It might have seemed at first as though the future railway engineer was going to settle down quietly to the useful but uneventful life of an agricultural labourer; for from tending cows he proceeded in due time (with a splendid advance of twopence) to leading the horses at the plough, spudding thistles, and hoeing turnips on his employer's farm. But the native bent of a powerful mind usually shows itself very early; and even during the days when Geordie was still stumbling across the freshly ploughed clods or driving the cows to pasture with a bunch of hazel twigs, his taste for mechanics already made itself felt in a very marked and practical fashion. During all his leisure time, the future engineer and his chum Bill Thirlwall occupied themselves with making clay models of engines, and fitting up a <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> with corks and twine like those which lifted the colliery baskets. Though Geordie Stephenson didn't go to school at the village teacher's, he was teaching himself in his own way by close observation and keen comprehension of all the machines and engines he could come across.|$|E

50|$|A {{discontinuous}} filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> (DFW {{machine or}} DW machine) is a machine for laying fiberglass filament windings over a cylindrical mould or mandrel bar using a carriage that is traveling along {{the axis of}} that mandrel.

The difference between the continuous and discontinuous filament <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> is the area on which filament winding is laying out.|$|E

40|$|In Domestic <b>Wind</b> <b>Machines,</b> if the <b>wind</b> {{speed is}} low, the output voltage is not {{sufficient}} to charge the battery as it is lower than the rated charging voltage of the battery. This limits the overall efficiency of the <b>Wind</b> <b>Machine</b> to 20 %. This study proposed to design and develop a Buck Boost Controller for the effective utilization of the <b>wind</b> <b>machine.</b> By implementing a controller based Buck Boost converter, the voltage produced at the lower wind speeds can also be utilized effectively by boosting it to the rated charging voltage of the battery. Also if the wind speed is high (> 14 m/s), the DC output voltage will increase to more than 65 V. The converter bucks this high voltage to the nominal battery charging voltage (52 V), thereby protecting the battery from over charging voltage. Thus the effective utilization of the <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> has been achieved by the use of the proposed Buck Boost Controller...|$|R

5000|$|... • Inside {{slotted stator}} laminationsThe needle-winding {{technique}} basically represents the only feasible winding process for inside slotted stator laminations. The stator mainly {{consists of a}} steel package, two end plates and slot insulation. The particular benefit of this process technology {{lies in the fact}} that the <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and interconnecting operations, all interconnecting measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> for the stator laminations. In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the <b>winding</b> <b>machine,</b> the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated.The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, stator laminations constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of stator laminations. Stator laminations for concentrated winding are divided into the following main groups.|$|E

5000|$|Doubling of yarn {{where two}} or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many {{purposes}} where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of theses threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling <b>winding</b> <b>machine,</b> and {{two or more}} of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling <b>winding</b> <b>machine).</b> The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights Water frames, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes ...|$|E
50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch.

Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.|$|E
