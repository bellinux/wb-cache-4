In the course of delignification, the py-lignin values were higher (by 2 to 5 %) compared to Klason values, which {{is in line with}} the importance of soluble lignin for total lignin determination. Pyrolysis analysis presents advantages over wet chemical procedures, and it can be applied to wood and pulps to determine lignin contents at different stages of the delignification process. The py-lignin values were used for kinetic modelling of delignification, with very high predictive value and results similar to those of modelling using wet chemical determinations...|$|R
