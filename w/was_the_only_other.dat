5|$|At {{the time}} of the ban, WCRC {{operated}} about 90% of all steam charter operations on Britain's railways. DB Schenker <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> operator licensed to run steam trains on Network Rail tracks. DB Schenker has a policy of only operating air braked trains, whereas many trains operated by WCRC use vacuum brakes, which meant that DB Schenker was unable to operate those charters in place of WCRC.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{planning}} a party. Knowing this, Liz recounts past parties of Kenneth's to Tracy, telling him that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> person who attended those parties. Feeling pity for Kenneth, Tracy tells the biggest gossips on TGS with Tracy Jordan, Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown), that T.I. will be attending. They persuade other people to attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never to throw a party again.|$|E

5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> mainland territory, {{with a population}} {{greater than that of}} the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E

5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> lesbian author they could recall.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Five-C {{formed on}} December 2, {{two days after}} the season ended.

The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paka (Hawaiian for Pat) while west of Palmyra Atoll. The system began to move westward at a steady pace. As Paka moved westward, dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on December 6.|$|E

5|$|As Benaud's deputy, Harvey helped {{materially}} in Australia's surprise 4–0 series {{victory to}} reclaim the Ashes. Harvey's form was modest, though. He scored 296 runs at 42.29, {{with more than half}} coming in one innings—a brilliant 167 in the Second Test at Melbourne, more than half his team's 308, which helped secure an eight wicket victory in the match. Otherwise, a 41 in the Fourth Test <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> time he passed 25 in the series. Outside the Tests, he scored 92 in the second match of the season between New South Wales and England, and ended the season with 949 runs at 49.95. It was season of two-halves; in the latter two months, he scored only 339 runs.|$|E

5|$|By 1852, {{the barge}} service to London only ran once a week, {{and it had}} ceased {{altogether}} three years later. Most vessels reaching Arundel were coasters rather than barges by 1886, and just 20 ships used the facilities that year. The Wey and Arun Canal closed in 1871. The proprietors of the upper river ceased to maintain the navigation from 1 January 1888, and the last barge passed through Hardham Tunnel on 29 January 1889. The river was abandoned as a navigation by a warrant issued {{as part of the}} Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. The River Lark in Suffolk <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> river navigation abandoned at that time. The Board of Trade issued a closing order in 1896, and after that, there was no navigation authority responsible for the upper river. However, traffic did not cease entirely.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the loss}} of captain and star striker, Eric Cantona {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} season, Ferguson acquired the services of England international Teddy Sheringham as a direct replacement on a three-year deal from Tottenham Hotspur for £3.5million. Cantona's departure meant that Roy Keane was promoted as captain and a reshuffle of squad numbers occurred; David Beckham was awarded the coveted number 7 shirt and Sheringham was given Beckham's former squad number 10. Henning Berg <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> new face to arrive at Old Trafford from Blackburn Rovers for a £5million fee at the start of the season.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, released March 2013, Cudi confirmed he was working closely with ASAP Rocky, while also revealing Haim, an all-female indie rock band, would appear on the album on a song produced by high-profile American record producer Hit-Boy and himself. On April 2, 2013 Hit-Boy, claimed besides Cudi, he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> person to provide production on the album. Cudi later confirmed the statement via Twitter. Cudi and Hit-Boy {{had been working on}} the aforementioned song since January 2011. The track is also the first record the two of them ever worked on together.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1920, King Alexander was {{bitten by}} a monkey during a walk through the gardens at Tatoi. The wound became {{infected}} and Alexander developed septicemia. On 19 October, he began to rave and called his mother at his bedside but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece. Worried about her son, and knowing that his grandmother <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> royal still in favor with the Venizelists, Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander. After several days of negotiations, the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but, delayed by rough seas, she arrived twelve hours after her grandson's death on 25 October. On 29 October, Alexander was buried at Tatoi; Olga was {{the only member of}} the royal family at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 Ashes Tour of England was McCabe's {{last for}} Australia. He was again {{appointed}} vice-captain for the tour. In the second tour match, McCabe scored 110 in an innings win over Oxford University. His 50 against Essex {{in the final}} match before the Tests <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> fifty {{in the first nine}} matches, in which he scored 301 runs at 37.62. He took a total of 4/50 in an innings win over Northamptonshire. McCabe’s lean run with the bat was causing concern for the Australians, as the other batsmen had been productive.|$|E
5|$|The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's {{meeting with}} the god Krishna. As Krishna was {{returning}} to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked for news. Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated {{and was about to}} curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage bowed to Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka to ask for a boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna.|$|E
