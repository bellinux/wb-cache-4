50|$|The {{history of}} food in Wales is poorly documented, and {{much of what is}} known lies in verbal and archeological evidence. Wales {{has a long history of}} baking using a bakestone (Welsh: maen), a large round {{portable}} flatstone. The flagstone was replaced by a metal plate known as a gradell (griddle), and these appeared among the list of objects made by blacksmiths in the Laws of Hywel Dda (13th century). Bakestones were commonly used throughut rural Wales for making flatbreads with evidence of their use found in farmhouses and in the homes of landed gentry. Early flatstones were placed on a tripod over an open fire, though in many areas, especially in south-west Wales, a specially designed circular ironframe with a half hoop handle was used. By the early decades of the twentieth century built-in <b>wall</b> <b>ovens</b> were common throughout kitchens in Wales, though these would be wood and coal burning. The tradition of using a bakestone coexisted with these newer ovens. Heating the large ovens was generally confined to one day a week and was used to make bread and cakes to last the family until the next week. These were augmented with whatever could be cooked over the open fireplace using the bakestone. Common foods cooked using this method were cacen radell (griddle cake), bara crai (unleavened bread), cacen gri (speckled cakes) and crempog.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} coking coals {{covering}} {{a wide range}} of coalification, thermoplastic properties and geographical origin were carbonized at two different scales. All the coals used are available in the international market and they are used by the cokemaking industry in blend preparation. The cokes were produced in two movable <b>wall</b> <b>ovens</b> of 15 and 300 kg capacity available at INCAR-CSIC facilities. The quality of the cokes was assessed by means of reactivity towards carbon dioxide and mechanical strength before and after the reaction with CO 2. The results obtained are very promising and a good correlation between the quality parameters of the cokes produced in the two ovens was found. The use of a semi-pilot oven against big-capacity ovens in the optimization of complex coking blends allows to obtain valuable results by using small amount of coal (15 kg vs. 300 - 400 kg) with the advantages that it is quicker, more flexible and of lower cost.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{carbonization}} of coal, {{the thermal}} conditions within the supporting coke <b>oven</b> <b>walls</b> vary substantially. This {{gives rise to}} a continually developing strain field within the walls which could cause cracks to occur in the refractory materials and, thus, shorten the operating life of the oven. Since a more precise knowledge of the location of high strain regions should help in improving the design of coke ovens, a mathematical study was initiated to identify the conditions under which high strain gradients are induced during carbonization. As such, this paper outlines the construction and application of a mathematical model to evaluate the strain distribution and its development in coke <b>oven</b> <b>walls</b> during carbonization. The model includes the influence of all the main thermal and physical properties of silica refractory bricks within a finite element formulation to evaluate the temperature and thermally induced strain distributions in a cross-section of a coke <b>oven</b> <b>wall.</b> The thermal strain field for a typical oven design is calculated at a number of stages throughout the carbonization cycle.

40|$|Two {{industrial}} coal blends (B 1 and B 2) used in cokemaking {{were selected}} for this study. Two wastes from scrap tyres (TC, F) were added to these coal blends at different ratios (98 : 2 and 95 : 5). The investigation was focused on assessing {{the influence of the}} additives on thermoplastic properties of coal by means of the Gieseler fluidity test and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition, the blends were carbonized in a 17 kg electrically heated movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> in order to examine the quality of the resultant cokes. Quality of the cokes produced was evaluated by measuring their cold mechanical strength, reactivity and post-reaction strength. It was found that ash composition of the additives contribute to a deterioration in coke quality. Moreover, F causes a greater decrease in coke strength after reaction with CO 2 due to the diminution of bulk density in the coking process and to the higher basicity index. Trace elements were also studied in relation to waste addition.

40|$|Two {{lubricating}} oils, {{a plastic}} waste composed mainly of polyolefins (95 %) and their mixtures (1 : 1 w/w) were assessed for possible use as minor components of coal blends for metallurgical coke production. The addition of 2 wt% plastic waste causes {{a decrease in}} the maximum fluidity of the coal developed during thermal heating between 400 and 500 °C. At the same addition rate, the two oils are good additives for mixing with coal/plastic blends in order to partially restore the caking ability of the co-carbonizing systems. Co-carbonizations of the coking blend with the different wastes were carried out in a movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> of 15 kg capacity. Although the bulk density remained unchanged, the addition of the plastic waste produced an increase in coking pressure to values that were too high for it to be considered as a safe blend. At the same time the mechanical strength of the partially gasified coke was improved as reflected by the CSR index. The oils, however, had the effect of reducing bulk density and the coking pressure generated during the process. When blended with the coal and the plastics, the oils appeared to act as good solvents of the polyolefins and also proved to be effective in decreasing coking pressure without negatively affecting coke quality...|$|R

40|$|Different {{amounts of}} low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{were added to}} a bituminous coal used to produce metallurgical coke. The effect of the plastic waste on the carbonization process and more exactly, on the coking pressure were investigated. A movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> at semi-pilot scale was used for measuring coking pressure generated. It was found that coking pressure increases for low LDPE addition levels (1 - 3 wt. %); however higher amounts of LDPE reduce coking pressure. To explain this behavior different blends of the coal and the residue were pyrolysed at three different temperatures (450, 500 and 600 C) in a Gray-King apparatus. The results show that LDPE causes a modification in the pyrolysis process and also influences the swelling process of the plastic stage. The increase of the coking pressure at low LDPE addition rates {{is associated with a}} less permeable coal plastic layer, which prevents the removal of the decomposition products and causes their retention in the semicoke matrix, evolving them in the post-plastic stage. Coking pressure decrease at high LDPE addition rates can be due to the charge shrinkage and the better permeability to the migration of oil components, which suggest a lower interaction between the coal and the LDPE. A delay in the degradation of LDPE is confirmed by the data provided by DRIFT and SEM. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of the composition of mixed plastic wastes on the thermoplastic properties of coal, the generation of coking pressure {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes in a movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> at semipilot scale. The mixed plastic wastes were selected to cover a wide spectrum in the relative proportions of high- and low-density polyethylenes (HDPE and LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). From the results it was deduced that the reduction in Gieseler fluidity in the coal blend is linked to the total amount of polyolefins in the waste. It was also found that these thermoplastics increase the pressure exerted against the wall in the course of the coking process and that coke quality is maintained or even improved. However, when the level of aromatic polymers such PS and PET are increased at the expense of polyolefins, the coking pressure decreases. Thus, the amount of aromatic polymers such as PS and PET in the waste is critical, not only for controlling Gieseler fluidity and coking pressure, but also for avoiding deterioration in coke quality (reactivity towards CO CRI and mechanical strength of the partially-gasified coke CSR). An amount of polyolefins in the waste lower than 65 wt. % for a secure coking pressure is established. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Two {{bituminous}} coals {{of different}} rank and coking characteristics were oxidized at low temperature for two months. Bituminous additives obtained in-situ in {{the coking plant}} were used to improve the thermoplastic properties of the oxidized coals. The Gieseler fluidity test was applied to evaluate their coking properties. A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the fresh, oxidized coals and their blends with the bituminous additives was carried in order to evaluate {{the interaction between the}} blend components. In addition, carbonization tests of the fresh and oxidized coals and the blends with the additives were carried out in a movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> of 17 kg capacity {{and the quality of the}} cokes tested by means of standardized methods generally used by the steel industry. The additives increased coal fluidity but the original fluidity values could not be recovered. From TGA it was concluded that the blend components behave independently of one another during co-carbonization. The oxidation of coal leads to an increase in the dangerousness of the low volatile coal which was related to the porous texture of the cokes. In addition, it was found that the decrease in the quality of the coke produced from low rank oxidized coal can be partially recovered by using bituminous additives.

The effect of the briquettes and briquette components on the fluidity of the industrial coal blends was investigated. It was found that biomass and non-coking coal produced a decrease in fluidity, whereas the binders increased it. The combined effect of both types of additive had the global effect of decreasing fluidity. Mixtures of the briquettes with the industrial coal blends were carbonized in a 17 kg movable <b>wall</b> <b>oven</b> in order to assess their influence on the quality of the cokes produced. Their cold mechanical strength (JIS DI 150 / 15 index), reactivity to CO 2 (CRI index) and post-reaction strength (CSR index) were also tested.
