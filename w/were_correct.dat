5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b>|$|E
5|$|The United States District Court for the Central District of California {{agreed that}} the state court rulings <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> however the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.

5|$|The rumours <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> In 1845, the MacLean laird {{sold the}} island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who {{converted}} Rùm into an estate for country sports. The Marquis first built a pier at Kinloch, and adjacent limekiln, to help with this process, re-introducing deer, both Red and Fallow. He then passed the land to his son, Viscount Cranbourne, who {{was more interested in}} fishing.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that <b>were</b> <b>correct</b> in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the bombing continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete bombing halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the bombing halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the bombing campaign under any circumstances. They <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> North Vietnam was not the target of intense bombing again for another three and half years.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations <b>were</b> <b>correct</b> and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} review began on 20 April 2007 and concluded on 14 December 2007. In the High Court decision Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy found {{in favour of}} South Dublin Co.

An application by Thomas Davis for leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme court was refused by Judge Murphy on 25 January 2008. Building commenced on the stadium on 6 May 2008.

5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group at the Metallurgical Laboratory that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's {{task was to}} design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time. Water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations <b>were</b> <b>correct</b> and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolants would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton <b>were</b> <b>correct</b> in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, United Diamond Fields of British Guiana was {{incorporated}} as a limited company. The company used Oppenheimer {{as a technical}} adviser, and immediately arranged to have its diamonds sold to the syndicate. The price was to be fixed for six months, with an auditor's certificate {{at the end of}} that time used to negotiate a new price. Oppenheimer was the only one with access to the accounting information, and the rest of the company had no way of checking that his figures <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> In the same time frame, a new deposit of diamonds was discovered in South Africa, forcing the syndicate to acquire several million pounds worth of these new diamonds to prevent their control over the market being destroyed. This strained their finances and the new diamonds forced the price down.|$|E

5|$|Chrissie {{arrives in}} Walford {{in search of}} her husband Den. Their {{marriage}} has turned sour and he has sold their bar in Spain and taken the money. Den manages to persuade her to give their marriage another try, and to stay in Walford with him. She is shocked to discover he has children, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson), and {{that while he was}} in Spain with her, he was in exile after faking his own death. She starts work as a hairdresser in Kate Mitchell's (Jill Halfpenny) nail salon and helps stepdaughter Vicki with her plans to enter fashion school. However, Den's elusive behaviour raises her suspicions that he is having an affair. He almost convinces her that she is mistaken, but she eventually learns that her fears <b>were</b> <b>correct</b> and uncovers the affair between Den and Kate. Feigning friendship, she hacks off most of Kate's hair and smashes up the beauty salon in a rage. She leaves Walford distraught at Den's betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The 12th Brigade was {{initially}} {{placed under the}} command of the 9th (Scottish) Division, responsible for holding the front line west of Albert, which had fallen into German hands. At this point, a breathless British staff officer appeared, stating that Dernancourt had fallen, and the Germans held the railway line in front of Albert. His orders were to guide the battalion into support positions on high ground behind the remnants of the 9th Division. Under Leane's stern gaze and questioning, he was unable to give the name of the commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General John Gellibrand, who had apparently issued the orders, and due to rumours that alarms and false orders were being spread by Germans dressed as British staff officers, Leane detained him as a suspected spy. Leane went to find Gellibrand himself, found that the orders <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> and the staff officer was released. After this delay in deployment, Leane directed his battalion east along the line of the Albert–Amiens road to the heights behind the 9th Division, which it reached in the early afternoon of 27 March.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They <b>were</b> <b>correct,</b> as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E
5|$|The {{republicans}} boasted a new air force, {{while the}} royalists {{claimed to have}} shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Russian pilot. The US State Department said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen, <b>were</b> <b>correct.</b> In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed {{a crash course in}} the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but had the advantage of high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December.|$|E
