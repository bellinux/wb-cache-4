5|$|SMS Kaiser was a 92-gun <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> of {{the line}} of the Austrian Navy, the last vessel of the type, and the only screw-driven example, to be built by the Austrians. She was built by the naval {{shipyard}} in Pola; she was laid down in March 1855, was launched in October 1858, and was completed the following year. The ship took part in the Second Schleswig War of 1864, but saw no action during her deployment to the North Sea. Kaiser did see action during the Seven Weeks' War two years later, during which she took part in the Battle of Lissa as the flagship of Anton von Petz, commander of the Austrian 2nd Division. Kaiser engaged several Italian ironclads simultaneously, rammed oneand damaged anotherwith gunfire. In doing so, she became the only <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> {{of the line}} to engage an ironclad warship in battle.|$|E

5|$|Rijadi's primary {{education}} {{was done at}} Dutch-run schools. His elementary school was taken at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School Ardjoeno, a private school owned and run by a Dutch religious group. While at Mangkoenegaran Middle School, where numerous students were named Slamet, he received an additional name, Rijadi; it is also during middle school that his father bought him back. After middle school and the Japanese occupation in 1942, he attended a sailor's academy in Jakarta. After graduation, he worked as navigator on a <b>wooden</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E

5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built <b>wooden</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{problems}} {{meant that}} the slate was usually used fairly close to the quarries. There was some transport by sea. A poem by the 15th century poet Guto'r Glyn asks the Dean of Bangor to send him a shipload of slates from Aberogwen, near Bangor, to Rhuddlan to roof a house at Henllan, near Denbigh. The wreck of a <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> carrying finished slates was discovered in the Menai Strait and is thought to date from the 16th century. By {{the second half of}} the 16th century, there was a small export trade of slates to Ireland from ports such as Beaumaris and Caernarfon. Slate exports from the Penrhyn estate are recorded from 1713 when 14 shipments totalling 415,000 slates were sent to Dublin. The slates were carried to the ports by pack-horses, and later by carts. This was sometimes done by women, the only female involvement in what was otherwise an exclusively male industry.|$|E

5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the slipway was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of hydraulic rams, additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E

25|$|Finding the world's longest <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> is not {{straightforward}} {{since there}} are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, {{not all of the}} claims to the title of the world's longest <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> are credible or verifiable.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of launch on 17 December 1912, Endurance was perhaps the strongest <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> ever built, with the {{possible}} exception of Fram, the vessel used by Fridtjof Nansen and later by Roald Amundsen. However, there was one major difference between the ships. Fram was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. But since Endurance was designed to operate in relatively loose pack ice she was not constructed so as to rise out of pressure to any great extent.|$|E
500|$|Rear Admiral David Farragut, {{commander}} of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, was to split his ships into two columns. The four monitors would comprise the starboard column, closest to Ft.

25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, {{there must be something}} about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E

Among other accomplishments, Fundy ports produced the fastest ship in the world, the ship Marco Polo; the largest <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> ever built in Canada, the ship William D. Lawrence; and the first female sea captain in the western world, Molly Kool of Alma, New Brunswick. The fabled mystery ship the Mary Celeste was also built on the Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship has}} a massively built wooden hull {{designed}} to withstand being frozen {{into the ice}} and resist crushing. At {{the time of her}} launch Discovery was widely held to be the strongest <b>wooden</b> <b>ship</b> ever built. The hull frames, placed much closer together than was normal, were made of solid sections of oak up to 11inches (27.9cm) thick. The outer hull was formed from two layers - one 6inches (15.2cm) thick and an outer skin some 5inches (12.7cm) thick. A third lining was laid inside the frames, forming a double bottom and skin around almost the entire hull. This meant that in places the hull was over 2feet (60cm) thick, providing not only formidable strength but excellent insulation against the cold. The construction meant {{that it was impossible to}} install portholes (and fitting them would have weakened the hull) so the crew relied on 'mushroom vents' on the deck to allow air and light into the interior.|$|E
