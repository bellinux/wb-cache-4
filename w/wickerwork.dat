5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift <b>wickerwork</b> curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|The Kam-speaking area {{is famous}} for its fir wood. Fir from the Kam area was used to build the ships of 15th-century {{explorer}} Zheng He and the Great Hall of the People. Major economic activities include carpentry and the manufacture of silverwork and <b>wickerwork.</b> Baskets and other <b>wickerwork</b> are usually made by men. Baskets can be made from five types of plant materials, namely glutinous rice straw, cogongrass, Guangxi grass, bamboo, and rattan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wickerwork,</b> {{only known}} from {{incidental}} depictions in sculptural and ceramic art, must {{once have been}} ubiquitous; the well-known pop ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.|$|E
25|$|Adena houses {{typically}} were conical structures, about 15–45 feet in diameter, {{and built}} around supporting poles, either single or double. Roofs {{were made of}} bark and walls could be <b>wickerwork</b> or bark.|$|E
25|$|To trap fish, the {{fishermen}} constructed fish fences, or weirs, of approximately 4m-long hazel sticks set upright {{in the mud}} {{at the bottom of}} shallow water. The fish must have been corralled by some method and then harvested at will. <b>Wickerwork</b> traps were also used.|$|E
25|$|The Midrash {{portrays the}} {{influence}} of Satan bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bathsheba was bathing, perhaps behind a screen of <b>wickerwork.</b> Satan is depicted as coming in the disguise of a bird. David, shooting at the bird, strikes the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba is revealed in her beauty to David (Sanhedrin 107a).|$|E
25|$|However, {{the first}} real {{evidence}} of civilisation is from the Neolithic or 5th millennium BC, from which evidence of houses has been found. Traces {{have been found in}} the south of Luxembourg at Grevenmacher, Diekirch, Aspelt and Weiler-la-Tour. The dwellings were made of a combination of tree trunks for the basic structure, mud-clad <b>wickerwork</b> walls, and roofs of thatched reeds or straw. Pottery from this period has been found near Remerschen.|$|E
25|$|Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) {{were used}} in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war. They were big enough for two people, made of <b>wickerwork</b> and wood, and often had {{decorated}} hoods. The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to {{four and a half}} feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} feature of the farmhouse, albeit one which is not externally visible, is its internal, wooden, post-and-beam construction which supports the entire building. The frame was originally made of oak, which was very durable, but from the 18th century it was also made from cheaper pinewood. To protect it from damp, the wooden posts rest on a stone foundation about 50cm high, often made of fieldstone. The non weight-bearing external walls were built as timber frames, the panels of which were originally filled in with willow <b>wickerwork</b> and clay (wattle and daub) and, later, with brick.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} form of protective body armor was chainmail. There are also {{references to the}} practice of wearing two coats of mail (dir’ayn), the one under the main one being shorter or even made of fabric or leather. Hauberks and large wooden or <b>wickerwork</b> shields were used as a protection in combat. The soldiers were usually equipped with swords that were hung in a baldric. They also possessed spears and daggers. Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as a state department. This reform was introduced in 637. A beginning was made with the Quraish and the Ansar and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands.|$|E
25|$|The Mercado Hidalgo {{was built}} by Ernesto Brunel in 1910 over what {{was the site of}} the old Gavira bullring. It was inaugurated by President Porfirio Díaz to {{celebrate}} Mexico’s Centennial of Independence. The roof has a cupola with a clock tower. The clock has four faces. The interior of the market is a giant metallic nave. The market sells typical candies of the region such as “charamuscas,” which is often shaped as a charro or mummy and wrapped in wax paper. The upper floor of the market contains a large number of crafts and souvenir shops containing products such as baskets, knit items, ceramics, leathercrafts and more. The ground floor has many everyday items such as fresh and packaged food, household goods, <b>wickerwork</b> and hardware.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Muslim Council and {{its head}} al-Husseini, who {{regarded}} himself as guardian {{of one of}} the three holy sites of Islam, launched an international campaign in Muslim countries to gather funds to restore and improve the Haram ash-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) or Temple Mount, and particularly the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the shrine Dome of the Rock (which houses the holiest site in Judaism). The whole area required extensive restoration, given the disrepair into which it had fallen from neglect in Ottoman times. Jerusalem was the original direction towards which Muslims prayed, until the Qibla was reorientated towards Mecca by Mohammed in the year 624. Al-Husseini commissioned the Turkish architect Mimar Kemalettin. In restoring the site, al-Husseini was also assisted by the Mandatory power's Catholic Director of Antiquities, Ernest Richmond. Under Richmond's supervision, the Turkish architect drew up a plan, and the execution of the works gave a notable stimulus to the revival of traditional artisan arts like mosaic tesselation, glassware production, woodcraft, <b>wickerwork</b> and iron-mongering.|$|E
500|$|Helmets used {{included}} gilded helmets {{similar to}} the silver helmets of the Sassanid empire. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck and cheeks either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals as well as Roman-type sandal boots were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armor included hardened leather scale or lamellar armor and mail armor. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armored than horsemen. Large wooden or <b>wickerwork</b> shields were used. Long-shafted spears were used, with infantry spears being [...] long and cavalry spears being up to [...] long. Short infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used; long swords were usually carried by horsemen. Swords were hung in baldrics. Bows were about [...] long when unbraced, similar in size to the famous English longbow. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow was about [...] Early Muslim archers, while being infantry archers without the mobility of horseback archer regiments, proved to be very effective in defending against light and unarmored cavalry attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} and <b>wickerwork</b> of the Zenú are almost completely lost, but the tools they used for production these items, such as needles and spindles made of bone, shells, and ceramics, did survive. The development of woven fabrics {{can be traced}} from numerous representations in gold and ceramic objects. [...] Women were portrayed with long woven skirts {{with a variety of}} patterns.|$|E
2500|$|The medieval {{period in}} Bosnia lasted until the {{invasion}} of Ottoman Empire. The social organization of Bosnia of that time developed into a system known as Zadruga. In Zadruga, the community was organized such that a few families with common interests would live closely together in housing clusters. The leaders of the community were selected according to their age and high ethical standards. [...] The Zadruga system was primarily found a rural, agrarian communities, greatly dependent on natural resources. [...] As the community grew, segments of families would collectively move to another area forming a new cluster or a village. [...] The continuing links between these related clusters stimulated both trade and economy. [...] Individual families lived together in houses known as Dinaric houses. [...] These were simple structures build of natural materials (usually timber and <b>wickerwork).</b> Interior space was organized around the hearth in a central room with separate private quarters for men and women.|$|E

60|$|MRS. TRAVERS {{sits in a}} <b>wickerwork</b> easy chair. MR. TRAVERS, {{smoking a}} cigar, sits {{the other side of}} the room. MARION stands by the open French window, looking out.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not noticed}} the girl before. She {{occupied}} a low, deep, <b>wickerwork</b> arm-chair, and I saw her in exact profile like a figure in a tapestry, and as motionless. Jacobus released my arm.|$|E
60|$|The Reverend Arthur Collingham Berkeley, curate of St. Fredegond's, lounged lazily {{in his own}} neatly padded <b>wickerwork</b> easy-chair, {{opposite}} the large lattice-paned windows of his pretty little first-floor rooms in the front quad of Magdalen.|$|E
60|$|The {{houses of}} the natives, {{constructed}} of the yellow bamboo, tastefully twisted together {{in a kind of}} <b>wickerwork,</b> and thatched with the long tapering leaves of the palmetto, are scattered irregularly along these valleys beneath the shady branches of the cocoa-nut trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am told {{he lives}} in a <b>wickerwork</b> castle in the {{mountains}} to the west of here. You see, Ugu became such a powerful magician that he didn't care to live in our city any longer for fear we would discover some of his secrets. So he went to the mountains and built him a splendid wicker castle which is so strong that even I and my people could not batter it down, and there he lives all by himself." ...|$|E
60|$|The cupboard--for it {{was little}} more--into which I had been hurried {{was low and}} narrow, and I felt in the {{darkness}} that it was heaped with peculiar round <b>wickerwork</b> baskets, the nature of which I could by no means imagine, although I discovered afterwards that they were lobster traps. The only light which entered was through the cracks of the old broken door, but these were so wide and numerous that I could see {{the whole of the}} room which I had just quitted. Sick and faint, with the shadow of death still clouding my wits, I was none the less fascinated by the scene which lay before me.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment Sir Richard Brandon issued from {{the door of his}} mansion leisurely, and with an air of calm serenity, pulling on his gloves. It was one of the knight's maxims that, under all circumstances, a gentleman should {{maintain}} an appearance of imperturbable serenity. When, however, he suddenly beheld the street boy falling, and his daughter standing up in her <b>wickerwork</b> chariot, holding on to the brown pony like an Amazon warrior of ancient times, his maxim somehow evaporated. His serenity vanished. So did his hat as he bounded from beneath it, and left it far behind in his mad and hopeless career after the runaway.|$|E
6000|$|... [9] The element found {{upon the}} {{maritime}} plain is salt or brackish. There is nothing concerning which the African traveller {{should be so}} particular as water; bitter with nitre, and full of organic matter, it causes all those dysenteric diseases which have made research {{in this part of}} the world a Upas tree to the discoverer. Pocket filters are invaluable. The water of wells should be boiled and passed through charcoal; and even then it might be mixed to a good purpose with a few drops of proof spirit. The Somal generally carry their store in large <b>wickerwork</b> pails. I preferred skins, as more portable and less likely to taint the water.|$|E
60|$|It was {{attached}} to a <b>wickerwork</b> vehicle which resembled a large clothes-basket on small wheels. We do not mean, of course, that the pony was affectionately attached to it. No; the attachment was involuntary and unavoidable, by reason of a brand-new yellow leather harness with brass buckles. It objected to the attachment, obviously, for it sidled this way, and straddled that way, and whisked its enormous little tail, and tossed its rotund little head, and stamped its ridiculously small feet; and champed its miniature bit, {{as if it had}} been a war-horse of the largest size, fit to carry a Wallace, a Bruce, or a Richard of the Lion-heart, into the midst of raging battle.|$|E
60|$|Though {{the lion}} season {{was now in}} full swing, as it happened, {{for the first five}} days of our stay at Zeu we saw none of these great cats, {{although}} in the darkness we heard them roaring in the distance. On the sixth night, however, we were awakened by a sound of wailing, which came from the village {{about a quarter of a}} mile away, and when we went out at dawn to see what was the matter, were met by a melancholy procession advancing from its walls. At the head of it marched the grey-haired old chief, followed by a number of screaming women, who in their excitement, or perhaps as a sign of mourning, had omitted to make their toilette, and by four men, who carried something horrid on a <b>wickerwork</b> door.|$|E
60|$|It was true. Screams of {{fear and}} pain {{told me that the}} front ranks had begun to fall, horse and foot together, into the cunningly devised snares of which with so much labour we had dug many, concealing them with earth spread over thin <b>wickerwork,</b> or rather {{interlaced}} boughs. Into them went the forerunners, to be pierced by the sharp, fire-hardened stakes set at the bottom of each pit. Vainly did those who were near enough to understand their danger call to the ranks behind to stop. They could not or would not comprehend, and had no room to extend their front. Forward surged the human torrent, thrusting all in front of it to death by wounds or suffocation in those deadly holes, till one by one they were filled level with the ground by struggling men and horses, over whom the army still rushed on.|$|E
6000|$|About mid-day, {{we crossed}} a {{depression}} in the centre, where Acacias supplied us with gum for luncheon, and sheltered flocks of antelope. I endeavoured to shoot the white-tailed Sig, and the large dun Oryx; but the brouhaha of the Caravan prevented execution. Shortly afterwards we came upon patches of holcus, which had grown wild, from seeds scattered by travellers. This was the first sight of grain that gladdened my eyes since I left Bombay: the grave of the First Murderer never knew a Triptolemus [2], and Zayla is a barren flat of sand. My companions eagerly devoured the pith of this African [...] "sweet cane," [...] despite its ill reputation for causing fever. I followed their example, and found it {{almost as good as}} bad sugar. The Bedouins loaded their spare asses with the bitter gourd, called Ubbah; externally it resembles the water melon, and becomes, when shaped, dried, and smoked, the <b>wickerwork</b> of the Somal, and the pottery of more civilized people.|$|E
60|$|When other {{conscious}} and intentional ornamentation began to supersede these rude natural and undesigned patterns, {{they were at}} first mere rough attempts {{on the part of}} the early potter to imitate, with the simple means at his disposal, the characteristic marks of the ropes or <b>wickerwork</b> by which the older vessels were necessarily surrounded. He had gradually learned, as Mr. Tylor well puts it, that clay alone or with some mixture of sand is capable of being used without any extraneous support for the manufacture of drinking and cooking vessels. He therefore began to model rudely thin globular bowls with his own hands, dispensing with the aid of thongs or basketwork. But he still naturally continued to imitate the original shapes--the gourd, the calabash, the plaited net, the round basket; and his eye required the familiar decoration which naturally resulted from the use of some one or other among these primitive methods. So he tried his hand at deliberate ornament in his own simple untutored fashion.|$|E
60|$|One evening about a {{week after}} the {{breaking}} of the yellow horse, Nigel and his grandmother sat {{on either side of the}} large empty fireplace in this spacious apartment. The supper had been removed, and so had the trestle tables upon which it had been served, so that the room seemed bare and empty. The stone floor was strewed with a thick layer of green rushes, which was swept out every Saturday and carried with it all the dirt and debris of the week. Several dogs were now crouched among these rushes, gnawing and cracking the bones which had been thrown from the table. A long wooden buffet loaded with plates and dishes filled one end of the room, but there was little other furniture save some benches against the walls, two dorseret chairs, one small table littered with chessmen, and a great iron coffer. In one corner was a high <b>wickerwork</b> stand, and on it two stately falcons were perched, silent and motionless, save for an occasional twinkle of their fierce yellow eyes.|$|E
60|$|He and Dr. Martineau sat in wide-armed cane {{chairs on}} the lawn with a <b>wickerwork</b> table bearing coffee cups and little glasses between them. A few other diners chatted and whispered about similar tables but not too close to our talkers to disturb them; the dining room behind them had cleared its tables and {{depressed}} its illumination. The moon, in its first quarter, hung above the sunset, sank after twilight, shone brighter and brighter among the western trees, and presently had gone, leaving the sky to an increasing multitude of stars. The Maidenhead river wearing its dusky blue draperies and its jewels of light had recovered all the magic Sir Richmond had stripped from it in the afternoon. The grave arches of the bridge, made complete circles by the reflexion of the water, sustained, as if by some unifying and justifying reason, the erratic flat flashes and streaks and glares of traffic that fretted to and fro overhead. A voice sang intermittently and a banjo tinkled, but remotely enough to be indistinct and agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|People, {{who have}} never seen, even from the outside, the Parisian world of fashion, have no idea to what an extent it has been invaded by the dog craze. Dogs are driven about in motors and open carriages. They are elaborately clipped and {{powdered}} and beribboned by special [...] "coiffeurs." [...] They wear little buckled coats and blankets, and in motors,--I don't feel quite sure of this,--they wear motor goggles. There {{are at least three}} or four--and for all I know there may be more--fashionable shops in Paris for dogs' supplies. There is one that any curious visitor may easily find at once in the Rue des Petits Champs close to the Avenue de l'Opera. There is another one midway in the galleries of the Palais Royal. In these shops you will see, in the first place, the chains, collars, and whips that are marks of the servitude in which dogs still live (though, by the way, there are already, I think, dog suffragettes heading a very strong movement). You will see also the most delicious, fashionable dog coats, very, very simple, fastened in front with one silver clasp, only one. In the Palais Royal shop they advertise, [...] "Newest summer models for 1913 in dogs' tailoring." [...] There are also dogs' beds made in <b>wickerwork</b> in cradle shape with eider-down coverlets worked over with silk.|$|E
60|$|Immediately before her, {{in strange}} {{contrast}} to this lifeless landscape, lay the peopled mere, fringed around with dead reeds standing so {{still in the}} frosty air {{that they might have}} been painted things. On this mere half the population of Leyden seemed to be gathered; at least there were thousands of them, shouting, laughing, and skimming to and fro in their bright garments like flocks of gay-plumaged birds. Among them, drawn by horses with bells tied to their harness, glided many sledges of <b>wickerwork</b> and wood mounted upon iron runners, their fore-ends fashioned to quaint shapes, such as the heads of dogs or bulls, or Tritons. Then there were vendors of cakes and sweetmeats, vendors of spirits also, who did a good trade on this cold day. Beggars too were numerous, and among them deformities, who, nowadays, would be hidden in charitable homes, slid about in wooden boxes, which they pushed along with crutches. Lastly many loafers had gathered there with stools for fine ladies to sit on while the skates were bound to their pretty feet, and chapmen with these articles for sale and straps wherewith to fasten them. To complete the picture the huge red ball of the sun was sinking to the west, and opposite to it the pale full moon began already to gather light and life.|$|E
6000|$|The second {{event was}} less unexpected, though quite equally {{embarrassing}} under existing circumstances. Hardly {{more than a}} month {{before the end of the}} quarter, a little black-eyed baby daughter came to add to the prospective burdens of the Le Breton family. She was a wee, fat, round-faced, dimpled Devonshire lass to look at, as far surpassing every previous baby in personal appearance as each of those previous babies, by universal admission, had surpassed all their earlier predecessors--a fact which, as Mr. Sanders remarked, ought to be of most gratifying import both to evolutionists and to philanthropists in general, as proving the continuous and progressive amelioration of the human race: and Edie was very proud of her indeed, as she lay placidly in her very plain little white robes on the pillow of her simple <b>wickerwork</b> cradle. But Ernest, though he learned to love the tiny intruder dearly afterwards, had no heart just then to bear the conventional congratulations of his friends and fellow-masters. Another mouth to feed, another life dependent upon him, and little enough, as it seemed, for him to feed it with. When Edie asked him what they should name the baby--he had just received an adverse answer to his application for a vacant secretaryship--he crumpled up the envelope bitterly in his hand, and cried out in his misery, 'Call her Pandora, Edie, call her Pandora; for we've got to the very bottom of the casket, and there is nothing at all left for us now but hope--and even of that very little!' ...|$|E
6000|$|They were {{travelling}} {{with one}} of Mr. Thomas Gunn's parties--fourteen days in Rome for fourteen pounds. They {{did not belong to}} the personally conducted party of course--Miss Winchelsea had seen to that--but they travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement. The people were the oddest mixture, and wonderfully amusing. There was a vociferous red-faced polyglot personal conductor in a pepper-and-salt suit, very long in the arms and legs and very active. He shouted proclamations. When he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm and held them until his purpose was accomplished. One hand was full of papers, tickets, counterfoils of tourists. The people of the personally conducted party were, it seemed, of two sorts; people the conductor wanted and could not find, and people he did not want and who followed him in a steadily growing tail up and down the platform. These people seemed, indeed, to think that their one chance of reaching Rome lay in keeping close to him. Three little old ladies were particularly energetic in his pursuit, and at last maddened him to the pitch of clapping them into a carriage and daring them to emerge again. For the rest of the time, one, two, or three of their heads protruded from the window wailing enquiries about [...] "a little <b>wickerwork</b> box" [...] whenever he drew near. There was a very stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black; there was a little old man like an aged hostler.|$|E
6000|$|Your German is not averse even to wild scenery, {{provided}} it be not too wild. But if he consider it too savage, he sets {{to work to}} tame it. I remember, in the neighbourhood of Dresden, discovering a picturesque and narrow valley leading down towards the Elbe. The winding roadway ran beside a mountain torrent, which for {{a mile or so}} fretted and foamed over rocks and boulders between wood-covered banks. I followed it enchanted until, turning a corner, I suddenly came across a gang of eighty or a hundred workmen. They were busy tidying up that valley, and making that stream respectable. All the stones that were impeding the course of the water they were carefully picking out and carting away. The bank on either side they were bricking up and cementing. The overhanging trees and bushes, the tangled vines and creepers they were rooting up and trimming down. A little further I came upon the finished work--the mountain valley as it ought to be, according to German ideas. The water, now a broad, sluggish stream, flowed over a level, gravelly bed, between two walls crowned with stone coping. At every hundred yards it gently descended down three shallow wooden platforms. For a space on either side the ground had been cleared, and at regular intervals young poplars planted. Each sapling was protected by a shield of <b>wickerwork</b> and bossed by an iron rod. In the course of a couple of years it is the hope of the local council to have [...] "finished" [...] that valley throughout its entire length, and made it fit for a tidy-minded lover of German nature to walk in. There will be a seat every fifty yards, a police notice every hundred, and a restaurant every half-mile.|$|E
