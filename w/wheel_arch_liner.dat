40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International Tire noise {{reduction}} was evaluated with acoustically designed exterior <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> <b>liners.</b> The <b>wheel</b> liners {{were made with}} a fiber blend selected to meet acoustical requirements, process demands, and durability challenges. Fiber liners were installed in a vehicle and noise level measurements were made under a range of operating conditions. The results show the reduction in tire noise {{that can be achieved}} at the source and in the vehicle. A critical part of this evaluation was a rapid analysis technique to select metrics that correlated with subjective assessments. The analysis techniques also helped quantify the improvements over a baseline condition...|$|R
50|$|The VR6 uses {{suspension}} components {{from the}} A3 model range, including the {{rear axle assembly}} and {{some parts of the}} A3's 'plus' type front axle assembly. The subsequent wider front wheel-track of the Corrado VR6 necessitated the fitting of new front wings with wider <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and <b>liners</b> along with a new front bumper assembly. Together with a new raised-style bonnet to accommodate the VR6 engine, these body improvements were carried across the model range.|$|R

50|$|The HF Integrale was facelited with bulged <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> for {{the wider}} section 195/55 VR tyres on 15-inch 6J alloy wheels. A new bonnet {{incorporated}} air louvres while the restyled bumpers wrapped around {{to meet the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> at front and rear. The front bumper, now wider, incorporates air intakes and for the rectangular auxiliary driving lights. The side skirts are faired into the <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> at front and rear and the twin rear view mirrors are finished in body colour. There were only 50 RHD factory built cars, none of which were officially imported to the UK.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wheel’s {{contribution}} to vehicle aerodynamic drag is around 25 %. Reducing this amount {{is of great}} interest to diminish fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. The knowledge of vortex structures around the wheel is therefore necessary to understand the physical mechanisms of vortex dynamics and to develop a strategy for flow control. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and aerodynamic torque measurements have been carried out in a wind tunnel in order to analyze the flow around a rotating wheel located inside a <b>wheel</b> <b>arch.</b> This study has been conducted in collaboration with RENAULT Research Department, Aero Concept Engineering (ACE) and ISAT (Institut Supérieur de l’Automobile et des Transports). Detailed flow-field measurements of a 40 percent full-scale bluff body have been obtained using two-dimensional PIV in the wind tunnel facility of ACE in Magny-Cours, France. Drag coefficient data have also been acquired using balance measurements for several <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume parameters. A global increase in drag has been shown with <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume growth. Longitudinal vortex structures such as “jetting ” have also been visualized using PIV. Wake characterization for three <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volumes has been obtained. Flow structure differences between stationary and rotating wheel have also been observed for one <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume configuration...|$|R
50|$|The main {{aesthetic}} {{difference between}} the GTI/CTi versions and other 205 models were the plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and trim, beefier front and rear bumper valances. The shell also underwent some minor changes, including larger <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> (to suit the larger wheels on the GTI and CTi), and the suspension was redesigned and sat lower on the GTI with stiffer springs, different wishbones and a drop-linked anti-roll bar.|$|R

50|$|After scrutineering at Bathurst in 1987, {{there had}} been rumours about the {{legality}} of the Eggenberger built Sierra's, specifically to do with oversized <b>wheel</b> <b>arches.</b> On the Thursday before qualifying an official protest was lodged against the Sierra's, which was held over {{due to the lack of}} a road going RS500 in Australia to compare them with. Eventually, after nearly four months and an eventual disqualification and later appeal by Eggenberger, the two Sierras were disqualified for having oversize <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> allowing them to fit larger wheels, giving McLeod, Brock and Parsons the race win.|$|R

50|$|A 2+2 {{has just}} two rear seats {{rather than the}} more common three. Reasons for this may include a car's more sporty nature, typical low roof line, wide <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> and (because of being front engined with rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive) wide central {{transmission}} tunnels, the last of these being the most pressing problem for a third (middle) seat. For example, the Porsche 911 is a rear engined, rear wheel drive, so it lacks a large transmission tunnel, but loses space in the rear due to its <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> reducing the space to 2 passengers.|$|R
50|$|Reception to the {{convertible}} car was generally favourable, although the strakes over the <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> were criticised {{in the press}} as outdated. A hardtop version was also produced with plain <b>wheel</b> <b>arches.</b> The company founders, Richard and Alan Jensen, favoured putting the model into production. The Norcros group had been controlling the company for some years and preferred to adopt an Italian styled body, a view shared by Managing Director Brian Owen and Deputy Chief Engineer Kevin Beattie. They approached Touring of Milan who produced a rival design that was put into production by Vignale as the Interceptor.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of textile soiling in the acoustic absorption of a <b>wheel</b> <b>arch.</b> In order to evaluate the influence of soiling it is carried out both a soil study characterization and an acoustic absorption measurement on real <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> samples. First, soil study starts with a short literature overview where the mechanisms of soil retention are analyzed. The field <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> study concerns visual observation of <b>wheel</b> <b>arch’s</b> special features followed by particle size measurement and soil visual and elemental analysis. These analysis were performed with a Laser Difraction equipment and a Scanning Electronic Microscope. Results conclude a range of particle size for soil collected and the identification of soil elemental composition, among other soiling features concerning textile porosity. The second part involves acoustic measurements for determining the airflow resistance value and the acoustic absorption coefficient of the same soiled textile analyzed before. Same measurements are repeated after removing soil from samples {{to see how much}} of the acoustic absorption can be restored. The determination of the acoustic absorption coefficient is performed with an impedance tube. Results show not only a null acoustic absorption in the soiled samples but also an insuficient improvement in the absorption after cleaning. Airflow resistance results prove that porosity is completely clogged even after cleaning. The paper concludes with short proposal for preserving textile from soiling and therefore maintain the original acoustic absorptio...|$|R

50|$|Later in 1941 the Japanese {{government}} told Toyota {{to produce}} a light truck for Japan's military. In 1942 Toyota developed the AK10 prototype by reverse-engineering a Bantam GP Jeep. The half-ton truck features an upright front grille, flat front <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> that angled down and back like the FJ40, headlights mounted above the <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> {{on either side of}} the radiator, and a folding windshield. The AK10 is powered by the 2259 cc, 4-cylinder Type C engine from the Toyota Model AE sedan coupled to a three-speed manual transmission and two-speed transfer gearbox. Unlike the U.S. Jeep, few AK10's were ever used and photographs of them in the battlefield are rare.|$|R
5000|$|Among all the Turbo cars, {{four were}} built with the [...] "Special Equipment" [...] (SE) specification, which {{included}} a leather interior, flared <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> large Compomotive split-rim alloy wheels, and a limited-slip differential. Of these four cars, three were Taimar Turbo SEs and one was a 3000S Turbo SE. The single 3000S Turbo SE was used by Martin Lilley as his personal transport until he sold it. The SE specification was also available for the normally aspirated cars, although estimates vary on the number built. Some cars that were originally built with the standard specifically were repaired with SE-style <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> flares by customer request.|$|R
