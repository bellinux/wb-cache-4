25|$|In {{relativistic}} mechanics, {{the momentum}} vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector {{is a time}} component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector (x,t). In exploring {{the properties of the}} spacetime momentum, <b>we</b> <b>start,</b> in Fig.3‑8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. p=0, but the time component equals mc.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with {{a limited amount of}} information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when <b>we</b> <b>start</b> at the point z = 1, then travel up and to the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, where we started.|$|E

25|$|In quantum mechanics, a {{group of}} {{particles}} known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.|$|E
