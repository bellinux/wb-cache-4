I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E

40|$|Communicating {{science to}} the public takes time away from busy {{research}} ca-reers. So <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it? I here offer six reasons. First, we owe that understand-ing {{to the people who}} fund our experi-ments, the taxpaying public. Second, we can leverage our skills as scientists to in-spire critical thinking in public and political dialog. Third, researchers are optimally positioned to stem the flow of scientific misinformation in the media. Fourth, we can explain the ways and the means by which science can (and cannot) improve law and social policy. Fifth, it is incumbent upon us to explain what sci-ence is and is not: while it is away of think-ing that upgrades our intuitions, it also comes with a deep understanding of (and tolerance for) uncertainty. Finally, we find ourselves in the pleasurable position of being able to share the raw beauty of the world around us—and in the case of neu-roscience, the world inside us. I suggest that scientists are optimally stationed to increase their presence in the public sphere: our training positions us to syn-thesize large bodies of data, weigh the ev-idence, and communicate with nuance, sincerity and exactitude...|$|E

40|$|When we dress {{our bodies}} we are {{choosing}} {{a version of}} ourselves to present. We may choose to present ourselves in alternative ways {{with regards to the}} different situations we may find ourselves in throughout that day. For work, socialising, sport, we may wear different garments due to practicalities of use. There will however usually be a choice and some control over our outwards appearance. For many heavily tattooed women their clothing often fulfils another purpose - that of protective barrier from the male gaze. ‘Modified women often received the criticism like “You’re such a pretty girl, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that to yourself?’ [Tattooed women] are deviant in their gender presentation, and this transgression justifies public comment. ’ (Beverly Yuen Thompson, 2015 : 167) This study intends to evaluate how tattooed women choose to display their personal identities through dress and appearance. The early stages of this research involves a series of in-depth interviews and wardrobe analyses with tattooed individuals to discuss self identity, aspects of the self, the public / private body, continuing identities and identity constraints with regards to clothing and appearance. Though tattoos are permanent their meaning can be transient, changing and evolving with personal identity. Along with garments in the wardrobe tattoos can have periods of favour where they are chosen to be on display, in contrast they can also be seen as something of regret and chosen to be concealed. Over long periods of time and even on a daily basis, individuals have an evolving relationship with their tattooed bodies and the clothing they use to reveal and conceal it...|$|E
40|$|<b>Why</b> {{on earth}} <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that? For generations this {{question}} has been asked of adolescents by bewildered adults {{in the home and}} classroom. In the Middle: The adolescent brain, behaviour and learning seeks to answer this question by looking at the latest empirical evidence related to the maturing adolescent brain. Over the last couple of decades neuroscience has provided us with exciting insights into how the brain develops and matures. Significantly, some of the latest research suggests that adolescent behaviour is not just about hormones or nurturing, but is also influenced by changes in the brain as it matures and restructures itself. Following on from his work looking at early brain development, Dr Nagel provides a continuing journey into the developing brain and mind with a degree of clarity to be appreciated by educators, health professionals and parents alike.

30|$|CD interviews, {{using both}} {{debriefing}} and a “think aloud” approach, assessed patient {{understanding of the}} draft PROs and evaluated the content, clarity and relevance of the questions, response options and recall periods. A second sample of eligible patients with SLE was recruited from {{four of the six}} practices. Just prior to the face-to-face interviews, patients completed paper versions of the PROs, formatted to look like electronic screen shots, as future administration of the tools using an electronic device (ePRO) is planned. CD interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide developed for the study, with questions such as, ‘Looking at question 1 (feeling tired or lacking energy), how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> define feeling tired? What about lacking energy? What is the difference between these terms? <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> say that? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think we need to include both terms or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> delete one? (If delete one), Which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> omit? <b>Why?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> have any other suggestions about how this question could be revised? If yes, please describe. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think that is clearer?’ All patients (with the exception of one) were asked about both PROs, but they were not asked to evaluate every item; the items perceived to be the most challenging were tested and to avoid the interviews becoming tedious for the patients, they were not asked to evaluate questions that were very similar to each other. Multiple rounds of CD interviews were conducted. After each round of interviews, the responses were reviewed and the PROs were modified accordingly. The revised drafts were then used in the next round of interviews.|$|R
