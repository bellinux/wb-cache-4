25|$|In {{the first}} round of the {{election}} on 16 June 1996, he came in third place behind Yeltsin and Zyuganov, with 14.7 percent of the vote. In exchange for Lebed's support, Yeltsin sacked his rival Defense Minister Grachev, replacing him with Igor Rodionov at Lebed's request. There was some evidence that Lebed had dealings <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> before the election ended. After {{the first round}}, Yeltsin named General Lebed as national security head by appointing him as the Secretary of the Security Council of Russia.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December, in {{a meeting}} <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> Gorbachev {{accepted}} the fait accompli and agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union. On 24 December, the Russian Federation, by mutual agreement of the other CIS states (which by this time included all of the remaining republics except Georgia) took the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations. The next day, Gorbachev resigned and the Soviet Union ceased to exist—thereby ending the world's oldest, largest and most powerful Communist state. Economic relations between the former Soviet republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Running with Vakha Arsanov, {{who became}} his vice president, Mashkadov won a {{majority}} of 60% of the votes and was congratulated by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who pledged to work towards rebuilding relations with Chechnya. Maskhadov was inaugurated on 12 February 1997, {{and at the same}} time he assumed the office of prime minister and abolished the office of Defence Minister he had occupied since late 1996. Maskhadov remained commander-in-chief of the republican armed forces. On 12 May 1997, Maskhadov then attained the apex of his political career when he signed a peace treaty <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> at the Kremlin.|$|E

25|$|As secretary, Ivanov was {{responsible}} for coordinating the daily work of the council, led by the president. But Ivanov's role as secretary was initially unclear to media observers. At {{the time of his}} appointment, the Security Council was a relatively new institution. (The council was set up by Yeltsin's tutelage in 1991–1992). Between 1992 and Ivanov's appointment in 1999, Yeltsin used the council as political expediency had dictated, but had not allowed it to emerge as a relatively strong and autonomous institution. Ivanov's predecessors in that post, including Putin, according to Western analysts, were either the second most powerful political figure in Russia or the just another functionary lacking close access to the center of state power, depending on their relationship <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the fait accompli and reluctantly agreed <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev learned what had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign {{as soon as he}} saw that the CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E

50|$|The {{released}} {{hostages were}} especially angered by Yeltsin's decision {{to let the}} rebels go free. Yeltsin meanwhile {{had gone to the}} summit of the Group of Seven in Halifax, Canada. After meeting <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> the Group of Seven condemned violence {{on both sides of the}} Chechen conflict. When asked about the crisis by a journalist, Yeltsin denounced the rebels as ″horrible criminals with black bands on their foreheads″ (″Это оголтелые бандиты, понимаешь, с чёрными повязками″).|$|E
50|$|The {{leaders of}} {{parliament}} were still not discounting {{the prospects of}} a compromise <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin.</b> The Russian Orthodox Church acted as a host to desultory discussions between representatives of the parliament and the president. The negotiations with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch as mediator continued until October 2. On the afternoon of October 3, Moscow police failed to control a demonstration near the White House, and the political impasse developed into armed conflict.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 Russia {{was hit by}} {{a severe}} {{financial}} crisis, and the FNPR was again at odds <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> calling for his resignation in an open letter. The union preferred Yevgeny Primakov, the dismissed prime minister, and the Otechestvo coalition. However, this support appears to have been relatively weak, as regional trade unions had their own positions and interests, and it was Vladimir Putin who was appointed Prime Minister, and then Acting President, four months later.|$|E

25|$|Few of {{the reforms}} planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm {{civilian}} political guidance, <b>with</b> President <b>Yeltsin</b> primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.|$|R

50|$|In the 1993 Duma elections, the pro-reform party {{supporting}} President Boris Yeltsin, Russia's Choice, {{received only}} 15% of the vote, {{and the new}} Communist Party of the Russian Federation only 12.4%. Liberal Democratic Party of Russia emerged as the winner with 22.9% of the popular vote. In effect, the Russian population was divided to those who supported Boris Yeltsin's reforms and {{to those who did}} not. It is regarded that the popularity of Zhirinovsky and his party arose from the electorate's dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin,</b> and their desire for a non-communist solution.|$|E
50|$|Ukraine was the second-most {{powerful}} {{republic in}} the Soviet Union both economically and politically (behind only Russia), and its secession ended any realistic chance of Gorbachev keeping the Soviet Union together. By December 1991 all former Soviet Republics except the RSFSR and the Kazakh SSR had formally seceded from the Union. A week after his election, Kravchuk joined <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> and Belarusian leader Stanislav Shushkevich in signing the Belavezha Accords, which {{declared that the}} Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The Soviet Union officially dissolved on December 26.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the failed}} August coup, Gorbachev found a {{fundamentally}} changed constellation of power, <b>with</b> <b>Yeltsin</b> in {{de facto control}} of much of a sometimes recalcitrant Soviet administrative apparatus. Although Gorbachev returned to his position as Soviet president, events began to bypass him. Communist Party activities were suspended. Most of the union republics quickly declared their independence, although many appeared willing to sign Gorbachev's vaguely-delineated confederation treaty. The Baltic states achieved full independence, and they quickly received diplomatic recognition from many nations. Gorbachev's rump government recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in August and September 1991.|$|E
