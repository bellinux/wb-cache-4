The <b>wired</b> <b>operation</b> influences the control distance, control reliability, control efficiency and so on. So {{how to make it}} longer, anti-interference, easy operation and high efficiency is a difficult problem. A kind of wireless basketball timer is designed based on micro-computer unit (MCU) and wireless nRF 24 L 01 module to compensate for the existing disadvantages, which has LED digital tube of large size for the section number display and middle size for game display and 24 s display. The user is easy to carry and control the timer wirelessly at any place in the basketball court using the sending control device. The test results show that the system, easy to control and stable to operate, is reliable to transmit the wireless data...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{interest}} and initiatives in brain research have driven a worldwide effort towards developing implantable neural interface systems with high spatiotemporal resolution and spatial coverage extending {{to the whole}} brain. Electrocorticography (ECoG) promises a minimally invasive, chronically implantable neural interface with resolution and spatial coverage capabilities that, when appropriately scaled, {{meet the needs of}} recently proposed brain initiatives. Current ECoG technologies, however, typically rely on cm-sized electrodes and <b>wired</b> <b>operation,</b> severely limiting their resolution and long-term use. The work presented here has advanced micro-electrocorticography (uECoG) technologies for wireless high-density cortical neural interfaces in two main directions: flexible active uECoG arrays; and modular fully integrated uECoG systems. This dissertation presents a systematic design methodology which addresses unique design challenges posed by the extreme densities, form factors and power budgets of these fully implantable neural interface systems, with experimental validation of their performance for neural signal acquisition, stimulation, and wireless powering and data communication. Notable innovations include 1) first demonstration of simultaneous wireless power and data telemetry at 6. 78 Mbps data rate over a single 13. 56 MHz inductive link; 2) integrated recording from a flexible active electrode ECoG array with 85 dB dynamic range at 7. 7 nJ energy per 16 -b sample; and 3) the first fully integrated and encapsulated wireless neural-interface-on-chip microsystem for non-contact neural sensing and energy-replenishing adiabatic stimulation delivering 145 uA current at 6 V compliance within 2. 25 mm 3 volume. In addition, the work presented here on advancing the resolution and coverage of neural interfaces extends further from the cortex to the retina. Despite considerable advances in retinal prostheses over the last two decades, the resolution of restored vision has remained severely limited, well below the 20 / 200 acuity threshold of blindness. Towards drastic improvements in spatial resolution, this dissertation presents a scalable architecture for retinal prostheses in which each stimulation electrode is directly activated by incident light and powered by a common voltage pulse transferred over a single wireless inductive link. The hybrid optical addressability and electronic powering scheme provides for separate spatial and temporal control over stimulation, and further provides optoelectronic gain for substantially lower light intensity thresholds than other optically addressed retinal prostheses using passive microphotodiode arrays. The architecture permits the use of high-density electrode arrays with ultra-high photosensitive silicon nanowires, obviating the need for excessive wiring and high-throughput data telemetry. Instead, the single inductive link drives the entire array of electrodes through two wires andprovides external control over waveform parameters for the common voltage stimulation. A complete system comprising inductive telemetry link, stimulation pulsedemodulator, charge-balancing series capacitor, and nanowire-based electrode device is integrated and validated ex vivo on rat retina tissue. Measurements demonstrate control over retinal neural activity both by light and electrical bias, validating the feasibility of the proposed architecture and its system components as an important first step towards a high-resolution optically addressed retinal prosthesis...|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual <b>wire</b> <b>operation</b> and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|R

30|$|If {{the wire}} path that bends {{at the center}} of the pitch axis can be constructed, the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires {{accompanying}} the pitch axis motion does not change. However, considering the durability of the wire and smooth <b>wire</b> <b>operation,</b> the bending <b>wire</b> path at the center is not adopted because it is necessary to maintain the radius. On the other hand, in the proposed wrist mechanism, arc-shaped guides are located on the upper and lower portions of the plane, including the pitch axis and the central axis of the supporting part. The arc-shaped guide provides sufficient bending radius of the wire and minimizes the change in the path length of the 2 nd-axis and 3 rd-axis wires arising from pitch axis motion. Compared with the case of using pulleys, there is concern about friction between the wire and circular arc-shaped surface, but the bending radius of the wire can be greatly increased and the number of parts can be greatly reduced.|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} are {{very active in}} marine research and operate their own research fleets. In this decade, a number of research vessels have been renewed and equipped with the most modern navigation systems and tools. However, {{much of the research}} gear used for biological sampling, especially in the deep-sea, is outdated and dependent on <b>wired</b> <b>operations.</b> The deployment of gear can be very time consuming and, thus, expensive. The present paper reviews wire-dependent, as well as autonomous research gear for biological sampling at the deep seafloor. We describe the requirements that new gear could fulfil, including the improvement of spatial and temporal sampling resolution, increased autonomy, more efficient sample conservation methodologies for morphological and molecular studies and the potential for extensive in situ real-time studies. We present applicable technologies from robotics research, which could be used to develop novel autonomous marine research gear, which may be deployed independently and/or simultaneously with traditional wired equipment. A variety of technological advancements make such ventures feasible and timely. In proportion to the running costs of modern research vessels, the development of such autonomous devices might be already paid off after a discrete number of pioneer expeditions...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} shown, {{that some of}} the tripartite boxes admitting bilocal decomposition, lead to non-locality under <b>wiring</b> <b>operation</b> applied to two of the subsystems [R. Gallego et al. Physical Review Letters 109, 070401 (2012) ]. In the following, we study this phenomenon quantitatively. Basing on the known classes of boxes closed under wirings, we introduced multipartite monotones which are counterparts of bipartite ones - the non-locality cost and robustness of non-locality. We then provide analytical lower bounds on both the monotones in terms of the Maximal Non-locality which can be obtained by Wirings (MWN). We prove also upper bounds for the MWN of a given box, based on the weight of boxes signaling in a particular direction, that appear in its bilocal decomposition. We study different classes of partially local boxes and find MWN for each class, using Linear Programming. We identify also the wirings which lead to MWN and exhibit {{that some of the}}m can serve as a witness of certain classes.
