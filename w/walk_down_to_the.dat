5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
