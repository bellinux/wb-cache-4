Boelcke and I had the one Englishman evenly between us, when another opponent, hunted by our friend Richthofen, cut directly in our path. As fast as lightning, Boelcke and I took evasive action simultaneously, and for one instant our wings obstructed our view of each other – it was then it occurred....|$|E

[...] He insisted the draws did not reflect on his team's {{negative}} tactics, but [...] "because of other teams coming back into the game". On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a chance. They all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{and lead}} {{designer}} Billy Thomson had previously confirmed that Crackdown was designed {{from the outset}} to be a long-running series of games, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying [...] "Microsoft was a little late in stepping {{up to the plate}} to ask for Crackdown 2, and by then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> started working on bigger, better things". However, then-corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility. [...] Realtime Studios manager Colin MacDonald clarified that if they have the resources after completion of , they could approach Microsoft to discuss a sequel.|$|E

Sega also provided some magazines with mockup images that showed another scrapped level, the desert-themed Dust Hill Zone, and the stolen 1992 prototype features an unused level slot titled [...] "Genocide City". Naka has also alluded to another scrapped level in the Sonic Jam Official Strategy Guide, explaining why the Metropolis Zone had three parts to it, while every other level only had two: [...] "Due to problems with the story, Act 3 {{was going to be}} a different Zone that would only appear once, but since it was cut, we still wanted to have something after Act 2. So that's why there are three acts in this one. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> finished the map, and it would have been a shame to waste it, so this is what we went with." ...|$|E

Joakim has said about the recording of En plats i solen: We had a kind of idea {{that we were going to}} record an album very quickly this time, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> some demos ready. We wanted to go into the studio, record and mix the album and then distribute it directly. Unlike the two previous albums, which were produced with Danish producer Joshua, En plats i solen is produced with Swedish producer Stefan Boman who worked with the band on Du & jag döden (2005). The band also released the first single from the forthcoming album, featuring the two A-sides Gamla Ullevi and Skisser för sommaren.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 June, {{the auditor}} sent out {{letters to the}} Liverpool councillors {{reporting}} that the council's failure to set a rate that financial year had already caused a loss of £106,103, and notifying them of an extraordinary audit under section 20 of the Local Government Finance Act 1982. According to council deputy leader Derek Hatton, the letters {{had the effect of}} prolonging the dispute: [...] "According to McMahon's assessment of the situation, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> broken the law. So what the hell had we to lose by doing it again?" [...] Their continued defiance took the form of a deficit budget involving a 9% rise in rates, which was to produce £236m, but [...] also approving £265m of spending. The budget was approved by 49 to 42 on 14 June, with five Labour councillors opposed. The council leadership saw the deficit budget as a tactic to comply with the law in one sense and so buy time.|$|E

[...] "The harvest upon the mountains," [...] says Dr. Robinson, [...] "ripens of course later than in the plains of the Jordan and the sea-coast. The barley-harvest precedes the wheat-harvest by a week or fortnight. On the 4th and 5th of June the people of Hebron were just beginning to gather their wheat; on the 11th and 12th the threshing-floors on the Mount of Olives were in full operation. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> seen the harvest in the same stage of progress on the plains of Gaza on the 19th of May; while at Jericho, on the 12th of May, the threshing-floors had nearly completed their work" [...] ('Biblical Researches,' vol. 2. p.99). According to the Midrash, {{from the beginning of the}} one, to {{the end of the}} other, were three months; though it may be, they were gathered in sooner: indeed from the passover to Pentecost were seven weeks, which was the difference between the beginning of one harvest, and the beginning of the other.|$|E
2500|$|Landing a {{recording}} deal in 1991, the group released their debut album Forever My Lady that same year. Writer Ronin Ro maintained, “They no longer resembled gospel singers… Puffy also {{asked them to}} build their mystique by posing for photos with {{their backs to the}} camera, which he borrowed from Guy’s stage show.” The album’s seductive energy showcased DeVante’s songwriting, establishing a uniqueness in his production that mixed old-fashioned soul singing with New Jack Swing, creating a production of great boldness. It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was us going back in the studio recreating the beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..." [...] The album went on to sell over three million copies.|$|E

In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster the People {{issued its}} first {{commercial}} non-single release in January 2011, a self-titled EP featuring [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", [...] "Houdini", and [...] "Helena Beat" [...] that {{was intended to}} hold fans over until their first studio album, Torches, was completed. Fans who purchased the EP through the iTunes Store were able to apply it towards the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, [...] "The plan helped {{us a great deal}} to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So by the time we put the record out in May, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> placed several songs." [...] Half of Torches songs were licensed—among them are: [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] (Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, Friends with Benefits, Entourage), [...] "Houdini" [...] (Gossip Girl); [...] "Helena Beat" [...] (The Vampire Diaries); [...] "Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)" [...] (Suits, Nissan Motors commercial); and [...] "Call It What You Want" [...] (FIFA 12). Palmer commented, [...] "I haven't seen this kind of a range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first Ting Tings record three-and-a-half years ago. That was an album where we licensed nine or [...] 10 songs on the album. We're kind of in a similar situation [...]" ...|$|E
