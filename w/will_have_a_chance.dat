25|$|Conversely, if a {{starting}} pitcher on the visiting team is losing the game (despite giving up no hits) after his team bats {{in the top}} of the ninth inning, his team will not take the field again unless they tied or took the lead. By this unusual situation, the starting pitcher will only have pitched eight complete innings with no chance to pitch a ninth inning to attempt a no-hitter. If the starting pitcher is on the home team, he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to pitch {{in the top of}} the ninth inning—a situation that occurred with Ken Johnson and later the combined efforts of Barber and Miller. However, a winning home team will not bat (and the visiting team will not field) in the bottom of the ninth if they are winning, and the game will end with only 8½ innings played. In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to require that a pitcher throw at least nine full innings for the no-hitter to be official. With that change, there have been four no-hit performances ruled ineligible despite the pitcher pitching an eight-inning complete game in a losing effort: Silver King (June 21, 1890), Andy Hawkins (July 1, 1990), Matt Young (April 12, 1992), and the combined pitching of Jered Weaver and José Arredondo (June 28, 2008).|$|E

2500|$|Players {{can choose}} from five {{difficulties}} ("Super Easy", [...] "Easy", [...] "Medium", [...] "Hard", and [...] "Expert") {{at the start of}} each song, with higher difficulties generally having more notes of the song in the track. Super Easy is a difficulty unique to Lego Rock Band. Super Easy uses the same charts as Easy, but on Super Easy it doesn't matter what pitch is hit for vocals, which fret is held for guitar and bass so long as the player strums in time, or which drum head is hit for drums. Lego Rock Band also includes other features not found in Rock Band 2 to make the game easier, such as an [...] "Automatic Kick Drum" [...] modifier which eliminates the need to use the drum controller's bass drum pedal. It is also impossible to fail a song when a player is performing poorly; instead, poor performances consume studs that have already been earned for the song, although the player <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to recover lost studs {{before the end of the}} song.

2500|$|Levin {{describes}} {{the stages of}} the young man and his dissociation from the love triangle.

The question of who is being loved by whom within the love triangle is quite controversial. Levin states that the young man and the poet are competing for the Dark Lady's affection. Sauer, on the other hand, claims that there is a connection between the love of the Dark lady for the young man and the love of the poet for the Dark Lady and the young man. Sonnet 154 addresses the love that the poet has for this young man in which the young man becomes the Dark Lady's fixture of desire. Sauer states that the Dark Lady may have stolen this young man away from the poet as the [...] " [...] Young Man or Lovely boy becomes the subject of desire for the Dark Lady, too, and the poet feels increasingly alienated as the Dark Lady 'steals' the Fair Young Man from him". Levin on the other hands states that the poet feels that the Dark lady may have run off with the young man and left him with his desire for her that is unfulfilled [...] "for the poet, the Dark Lady becomes the occasion for fiction making: she becomes the emblem of unchecked desire, passion, and frustration, but also a symbol of mystery".|$|E
