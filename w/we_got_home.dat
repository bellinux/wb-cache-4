2500|$|Lake {{joined his}} first band, Unit Four, playing cover songs as their singer and guitarist, through 1965. Following their split, Lake and Unit Four bassist Dave Genes formed another covers group, the Time Checks, until 1966. He {{then became a}} member of The Shame, where he is {{featured}} on their single, [...] "Don't Go Away Little Girl", written by Janis Ian. During his stay in Carlisle for a gig, Lake contracted pneumonia and continued to perform on stage. His bandmates refused to drive back home that night, leaving Lake to sleep in the van where he [...] "woke up blue... When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> I was nearly dead... That was probably the worst I went through". Following a brief stint in the Shy Limbs, by 1968 Lake was involved with The Gods, based in Hatfield, which he described as [...] "a very poor training college", but the group secured a residency at the Marquee Club in London. Lake left the group in 1968 over creative differences as the band were to enter the recording studio. Their keyboardist Ken Hensley later said that Lake [...] "was far too talented to be kept in the background".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} bring him to, and then I went for the doctor. He revived, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>home</b> to his mother's. The doctor says he will get well; but he advised me {{to come and see}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I met {{him that}} night, {{and he called}} next day to ask if <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could {{not come to the}} house any more." ...|$|R

I was the leader. We turned back to fight the Crows. I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. It was a very cold winter. There were twenty of us and each had four horses. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> them <b>home</b> all right and it was a good trip that time. We had a scalp dance when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} sure," [...] I answered. [...] "Look here, Jacky," [...] I continued, [...] "supposing I {{wanted to stay}} all day and to go back to-night, so that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> to breakfast to-morrow morning, would that be too long for you?" ...|$|E

60|$|But {{he turned}} and {{followed}} when I beckoned to him, and finding that he acknowledged that influence in me, I led the way straight home. It was not far, only at {{the summit of the}} hill. We passed but one man. I doubted if <b>we</b> should have <b>got</b> <b>home</b> without assistance, the boy's steps were so uncertain and tremulous. He made no complaint, however, and was strangely unconcerned about himself, if I may say so strange a thing.|$|R
5000|$|Her next {{race was}} the Dubai World Cup, held on March 30 on a {{synthetic}} all-weather surface at Meydan Racecourse. She broke well {{and within a}} few strides went to the lead, which she held the around the clubhouse turn and {{all the way down the}} backstretch. Going into the final turn, she added a little distance between her and the field. As they rounded into the stretch, 2011 Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom came up to challenge her and went on to win. Royal Delta faded to tenth. [...] "My trip was good," [...] said Smith. [...] "She just didn't seem to care for it. Every time she had to pick it up, she struggled. After four or five passed her, we were pretty much done - then <b>we</b> just <b>got</b> <b>home</b> safe." ...|$|R
60|$|About {{the middle}} of November, finding my health no better, and insects, birds, and shells all very scarce, I {{determined}} to return to Mamajam, and pack up my collections before the heavy rains commenced. The wind {{had already begun to}} blow from the west, and many signs indicated that the rainy season might set in earlier than usual; and then everything becomes very damp, and {{it is almost impossible to}} dry collections properly. My kind friend Mr. Mesman again lent me his pack-horses, and with the assistance of a few men to carry my birds and insects, which I did not like to trust on horses' backs, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> everything <b>home</b> safe. Few can imagine the luxury it was to stretch myself on a sofa, and to take my supper comfortably at table seated in my easy bamboo chair, after having for five weeks taken all my meals uncomfortably on the floor. Such things are trifles in health, but when the body is weakened by disease the habits of a lifetime cannot be so easily set aside.|$|R
6000|$|There was a supper-tray after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night, and I {{think we}} should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable {{domestic}} occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, [...] "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suggested}} this to Mrs. March when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> and, in {{the need}} of some relief from the tension she had been in, she was fain to accept the theory provisionally, though I knew that her later rejection of {{it would be all}} the more violent for this respite.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> {{we found}} Hannah Jane and Father and Mother--who had arrived there {{an hour before}} us--simply distracted.

60|$|We had, if anything, less {{business}} {{really in}} Algeciras than in Gibraltar, but {{we went into}} the town nearly every afternoon, and wantonly bought things. By this means we proved that the Andalusian shopmen had not the proud phlegm of the Castilians across their counters. In the principal dry-goods store two salesmen rivaled each other in showing us politeness, and sent home our small purchases as promptly as if we had done them a favor in buying. We were indeed the wonder of our fellow-customers who were not buying; but our pride was brought down in the little shop where the proprietress was too much concerned in cooking her dinner (it smelled delicious) to mind our wish for a very cheap green vase, inestimably Spanish after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> it <b>home.</b> However, in another shop where the lady was ironing her week's wash on the counter, a lady friend who was making her an afternoon call got such a vase down for us and transacted the negotiation out of pure good will for both parties to it.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> {{the hogs}} <b>home</b> just at dark--most of them. The princess Nerovens de Morganore was missing, {{and two of}} her ladies in waiting: namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains, the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a slight limp in the forward shank on the {{starboard}} side--a couple of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw. Also among the missing were several mere baronesses--and I wanted them to stay missing; but no, all that sausage-meat had to be found; so servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills to that end.|$|R

"Well, sir,--when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> I {{took out}} the medicines, but the pocket-book {{was nowhere to be}} found; and I have been back with James, and we have looked all along the road, and under the hemlock-tree, and we have inquired at the apothecary's; but we cannot find it any where." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at four, and dined at five, {{and smoked}} cigars till eight.

40|$|Jimmy Carter {{has spent}} much of his life in the rural South, about two hours 2 ̆ 7 drive south of Atlanta. He grew up not in Plains, as is widely believed, but in Archery, Georgia, on his parents 2 ̆ 7 farm. This {{photograph}} was taken in 1926, when he was two. Jimmy Carter described his father as a 2 ̆ 2 stern disciplinarian. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 My most vivid memory of a whipping, 2 ̆ 2 Carter wrote in his first autobiography, 2 ̆ 2 was when I was four or five years old. I had been to my Sunday School class, and as was his custom Daddy had given me a penny for the offering. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home,</b> I took off my Sunday clothes and put the contents of my pocket on a dresser. There were two pennies lying there. Daddy thus discovered that when they passed the collection plate I had taken out an extra penny, instead of putting mine in for the offering. That was the last money I ever stole 2 ̆ 2 [Carter, Why Not the Best?, p. 19]. [URL]...|$|R

60|$|She got calmer by degrees, {{and then}} we soothed her; now talking encouragingly, and now jesting a little with her, until she began to raise her head and speak to us. So <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on, until {{she was able to}} smile, and then to laugh, and then to sit up, half ashamed; while Peggotty {{recalled}} her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, and made her neat again, lest her uncle should wonder, when she <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> why his darling had been crying.|$|R
60|$|Abbotsford, August 27.--To-day we journeyed {{through the}} hills and amongst the storms; the weather rather {{bullying}} than bad. We viewed the Grey Mare's Tail, and I still felt confident in crawling along the ghastly bank by which you approach the fall. I will certainly get some road of application to Mr. Hope Johnstone, to pray {{him to make the}} place accessible. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> before half-past five, having travelled forty miles.|$|E

60|$|Now, I {{observed}} that evening, as I had observed for some days past, that Ada and Richard {{were more than}} ever attached to each other's society, which was but natural, seeing {{that they were going}} to be separated so soon.

60|$|The upper {{room is a}} {{passageway}} {{for people}} who are walking round the town on the Plantagenet wall, and one morning we took this walk in sunshine that befitted the Sabbath. Half the children of York seemed to be taking it, too, with their good parents, who had stayed away from church to give them this pleasure, the fathers putting on their frock-coats and top-hats, which are worn on no other days in the provincial cities of England. For a Plantagenet wall, that of York is in excellent repair, and it is very clean, so that the children could not spoil their Sunday best by clambering on the parapet, and trying to fall over it. There was no parapet on the other side, and they could have fallen over that without trouble; but it would not have served the same purpose; for under the parapet there were the most alluringly ragged little boys, with untidy goats and delightfully dirty geese. There was no trace of a moat outside the wall, where pleasant cottages pressed close to it with their gardens full of bright flowers. At one point there were far-spreading sheep and cattle pens, where there is a weekly market, and at another the old Norman castle which cruel Conqueror William built to hold the city, and which has suffered change, not unpicturesque, into prisons for unluckier criminals, and the Assize Courts for their condemnation. From time to time the wall left off, and then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> down, perforce, and walked to the next piece of it. In these pieces we made the most of the old gates, especially Walmgate Bar, which has a barbican. I should be at a loss to say why the barbican should have commended it so; perhaps it was because we there realized, for the first time, what a barbican was; I doubt if the reader knows, now. Otherwise, I should have preferred Monk Bar or Micklegate Bar, as being more like those I was used to in the theatre. But we came back gladly to Bootham Bar, holding that a portcullis was equal any day to a barbican, and feeling as if <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> in the more familiar neighborhood.|$|R
6000|$|Searle {{closed his}} eyes, {{shivering}} with a long-drawn tremor which I hardly knew {{whether to take}} for an expression of physical or of mental pain. In a moment I saw it was neither. [...] "Oh my country, my country, my country!" [...] he murmured in a broken voice; and then sat for some time abstracted and lost. I signalled our companion {{that it was time}} we should bring our small session to a close, and he, without hesitating, possessed himself of the handle of the Bath-chair and pushed it before him. <b>We</b> had <b>got</b> halfway <b>home</b> before Searle spoke or moved. Suddenly in the High Street, as we passed a chop-house from whose open doors we caught a waft of old-fashioned cookery and other restorative elements, he motioned us to halt. [...] "This is my last five pounds"--and he drew a note from his pocket-book. [...] "Do me the favour, Mr. Rawson, to accept it. Go in there and order the best dinner they can give you. Call for a bottle of Burgundy and drink it to my eternal rest!" ...|$|R
