40|$|Questions without Answers? This article {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how relational uncertainty coincides <b>with</b> <b>people’s</b> ability to process relational information. The general premise is that individuals experiencing relational uncertainty should have difficulty deriv-ing inferences because they lack the knowledge necessary to identify and inter-pret relational cues. The authors use this reasoning to deduce hypotheses about how relational uncertainty may correspond <b>with</b> <b>people’s</b> perceptions of relationship talk, judgments of relational messages, and evaluations {{of the difficulty of}} interaction. They conducted a study of conversations between romantic partners (N = 120 couples). As predicted, relational uncertainty was negatively associated <b>with</b> <b>people’s</b> perceptions of relationship talk after con-trolling for the perceptions of third-party observers. Relational uncertainty was negatively associated with the extremity of people’s judgments about rela-tional messages. Furthermore, relational uncertainty was positively associ-ated <b>with</b> <b>people’s</b> perceptions of the difficulty of interaction. They conclude by discussing how these findings illuminate the connection between relational uncertainty and relational information processing...|$|R
