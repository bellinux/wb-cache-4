5|$|Two {{people were}} arrested in 1997 and four in 1998 for espionage activities. Of those arrested in 1997, one <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> {{permanent}} resident who was a deep-cover operative of a foreign intelligence service who had used the other person, a female Singaporean, as a collaborator. Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift {{in his first}} film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Male</b> War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Miller portrayed {{a police}} {{inspector}} in Terence Young's One Night with You, which also featured a young Christopher Lee {{in a minor}} role. After an uncredited role as an Italian waiter at the Savoy Hotel in The Blind Goddess (1948), he had a substantial role as George II of England in Anthony Kimmins's biopic Bonnie Prince Charlie about the Jacobite Risings alongside David Niven, who portrayed Charles II. In 1949, he appeared as Tony the café proprietor in Lawrence Huntington's Man on the Run; a customer in Jack Warner's The Huggetts Abroad; Leon Stolz in Arthur Crabtree's Don't Ever Leave Me alongside Petula Clark and Jimmy Hanley; and had uncredited roles as black marketeer Herr Schindler in I <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Male</b> War Bride and as a headwaiter in the classic film noir The Third Man opposite Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Male</b> War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting {{the way he looked}} in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of the}} highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male.</b> These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanians made raids in Halych, Lodomeria, and Poland, almost {{reaching}} Cracow in November 1376. A riot {{broke out}} in Cracow against the unpopular queen mother, Elizabeth, on 6 December. The rioters slaughtered about 160 servants of the queen-mother, forcing her to flee to Hungary. Taking advantage of the situation, Władysław the White, Duke of Gniewkowo, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> member of the royal Piast dynasty, announced his claim to the Polish crown. However, Louis's partisans defeated the pretender, and Louis made him abbot of the Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary. Louis appointed Vladislaus II of Opole his governor in Poland. In summer 1377, Louis invaded the territories held by the Lithuanian prince, George, in Lodomeria. His Polish troops soon captured Chełm, while Louis seized George's seat, Belz, after besieging it for seven weeks. He incorporated the occupied territories in Lodomeria, together with Galicia, into the Kingdom of Hungary. Three Lithuanian princesFedor, Prince of Ratno, and two princes of Podolia, Alexander and Borisaccepted Louis's suzerainty.|$|E

There, he meets up with his old friends who were {{characters}} in Less Than Zero. Like Clay, they have all become involved in the film industry: his philandering friend Trent Burroughswho has married Blairis a manager, while Clay's former classmate at Camden, Daniel Carter, has become a famous producer. Julian Wells, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> prostitute in Less Than Zero, has become an ultra-discreet high-class pimp representing struggling young actors who do not wish to tarnish future careers. Rip Millar, Clay's former drug dealer, now controls his own cartel and has become disfigured through repeated plastic surgeries.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} {{prominent}} women at court {{during and after}} Wu's reign, including Shangguan Wan'er (664–710), a poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office. In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, Empress Wei (d. 710), persuaded her husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> right only). Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. Two weeks later, Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction. He then installed his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710–712) on the throne. Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by Princess Taiping. This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to Emperor Xuanzong.|$|E
5|$|Wolves in Japan became extinct {{during the}} Meiji {{restoration}} period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed {{a threat to}} ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago {{in response to these}} climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.|$|E

25|$|The {{same was}} the case at the {{creation}} of the first humans. By thought, the supreme deity planned for the creation of human beings (a female and a male).

25|$|Sergius’ {{ties with}} the family of Theophylact were made even closer, at least {{according}} to rumour, by Sergius’ supposed affair with Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia.

The only source of this affair is the chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, writing some 50 years after the events of Sergius’ pontificate.
