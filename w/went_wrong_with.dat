5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E

However, he was not successful and believes that he was removed from the position {{as a result of his}} stand on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{soldier was}} able to fight off the three men and his shouts alerted the British {{soldiers}} in the guardroom near the main entrance. It was through the main gate that the raiders had planned to use to flee if things <b>went</b> <b>wrong.</b> <b>With</b> their escape route blocked, the soldiers now shooting from the guardroom, Boyce and his men retreated back the way they came over the wall and escaped into the surrounding marshes. The 20 other raiders outside the main entrance were left standing outside the main gate.|$|E

25|$|Although Gravano evaded {{criminal}} charges, he incurred Castellano's wrath {{over the}} unsanctioned killing. Gravano attempted to lie low {{for nearly three}} weeks afterwards, during which time he called his crew together and {{made the decision to}} kill Castellano if necessary. Gravano and Milito were then summoned to a meeting with Castellano at a Manhattan restaurant. Castellano had been given the details of what Fiala had done, but he was still livid that Gravano had not come to him for permission to kill Fiala first. Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the hit.|$|E
25|$|Many things <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the {{operation}} {{that came to}} light afterwards, such as the RMPs only having 50 rounds each, when the minimum should have been 150. In the post-invasion time, it wasn't only their ammunition that had been de-scaled; the RMPs had no morphine and no smoke grenades either. A smoke grenade may have alerted the passing helicopters to their position. They {{did not have an}} Iridium satellite phone to call out of the area and {{because of a lack of}} intelligence and information sharing, the Paratroopers and the RMPs were unaware of each others location. Accusations that the Paras had left the RMPs behind were denied in the press by senior commanders just days after the event.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{initially}} pitched to Echevarria by Robert Gillan, {{who was on}} the staff of Deep Space Nine as Assistant Script Coordinator. Echevarria was immediately convinced, and told Behr about the story who was equally as enthusiastic. In Gillan's original pitch, there wasn't a specific setting clearly set out, but Behr and Echevarria were sold on the idea that nothing <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the holosuites — it was simply where the computer decided to store the information following a transporter accident. Producer Ronald D. Moore came up with the 1960s setting, as he felt it was appropriate since Garak was a spy for the Cardassian Obsidian Order. He wrote the teleplay, and based it on a variety of sources including James Bond, Our Man Flint, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Wild Wild West. He later explained that he [...] "loved all of them as a kid. They had a certain panache. I loved writing that episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Even {{before the}} senatorial {{election}}, the rival factions in the Ohio Republican Party were battling less than usual, {{but it was}} not until the day of the senatorial election that McKinley and Foraker reached a definite understanding for peace during the 1896 campaign. [...] Foraker agreed to support McKinley's presidential bid, and to travel to New York to approach that state's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, hoping to gain Platt's support for McKinley. [...] In March, Foraker addressed the state convention in support of McKinley in a widely publicized speech. However, he was reluctant to be a delegate to the national convention, fearing that he would be blamed if anything <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> McKinley's candidacy. It was only after considerable prodding from the presidential candidate that Foraker agreed to be a delegate, and to place McKinley's name in nomination. [...] McKinley desired that Foraker nominate him to show that he had the united support of the state Republican Party. [...] Senator-elect Foraker eventually agreed, and gave the nominating speech, part of which was heard by McKinley via telephone line to Canton.|$|E
500|$|Jarett Wieselman from New York Post {{tried to}} {{understand}} what actually <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the production, {{and came to the}} conclusion that the mutual disagreements between Gaga and Kahn led to the video being a [...] "piece of rubbish". He deemed the whole issue surrounding the production as [...] "foolish", in the end agreeing that [...] "it was foolish of us to expect that GaGa would never stumble because, despite the preternatural image constantly presented, she is only human after all." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video, calling the song [...] "over-the-top" [...] with a [...] "lackluster" [...] and [...] "understated" [...] video. Doses Leah Collins was more neutral in her review, questioning if Gaga was simply [...] "swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown-stone steps" [...] or just attempting to [...] "be saving a metric buttload on the budget". While reviewing the video for The Vancouver Sun, Collins compared Gaga's look in the video to a [...] "hooker" [...] from the 1982 American science fiction film, Blade Runner.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt with Den of Geek {{stated that}} [...] " [...] is, quite genuinely, brilliant. Everything that <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Agents Of SHIELD goes right in Agent Carter. It looks fantastic, doing its level best to {{recreate}} 1940s New York {{on what is}} probably quite a low budget, and succeeding. It ties into the MCU in ways that feel natural ...There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and even the writing is strong, with compelling plots giving space to subplots which chug along at a nice pace. And the most surprising part? It's actually funny." [...] He was positive about Atwell's performance, but praised D'Arcy as [...] "the breakout star of the cast". Amy Ratcliffe of Nerdist concluded her review of the episode saying [...] "Overall, Agent Carter didn’t {{open the door and}} tiptoe in; it busted through and took charge. Atwell is a magnetic force of nature and seems completely at home in the role, and she’s complemented by D’Arcy and Gjokaj." [...] She also felt that lessons had been learned from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and thought that all the work put into creating the period setting had paid off. Britt Hayes, reviewing for Screen Crush, felt that the episode [...] "fumbles a little, as most series do when they’re introducing us to a new world", but was positive of Atwell, D'Arcy, and the cinematography. Hayes' major issue was the score, which she explained [...] "often lingers a little too long and feels slightly tone deaf—it definitely cheapens the proceedings, and reminds us that this is television, not film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly afterward, it is {{reported}} that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany {{to talk to the}} boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God.|$|E
