The door is suddenly flung open and two male colleagues of the counsellor's burst open into the room. In a second they {{take a look at}} the scene, and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they see—the counsellor looking lost, Karen looking shocked, and most significantly, David standing over the counsellor, brandishing a fire extinguisher in an apparently threatening manner. Presuming their colleague to be in danger, the two men hurl themselves at David, knocking him to the ground. He squeals as he goes down, and complains loudly as he's pinned to the floor." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so we {{can do a lot of}} different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E
500|$|While walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly {{sings the}} 1983 Pat Benatar song [...] "Love Is a Battlefield". During Ike's {{supposed}} funeral, a bagpipe player starts playing the Hebrew folk song [...] "Hava Nagila". At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase [...] "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust", from the Anglican burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, {{one of them}} shouts, [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> you and Homer Simpson have in common... Dope!". This references the famous catchphrase from The Simpsons, [...] "D'oh!", which sounds similar to the word dope, meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offer the boys a dish called [...] "GaHekgafuga", {{which is not a}} real dish. When Mackey is in India, he is captured by members of The A-Team, and driven away in their van. Mackey is taken to rehabilitation to the Betty Ford Clinic, which is based on a real-life hospital.|$|E

500|$|In the New Testament, all Christians are {{referred}} to as saints. However, the use of [...] "saint" [...] as a title for an individual who had led a good and exemplary life or who had been martyred began to develop in Christianity. By the time of the Reformation, the use of [...] "saint" [...] was almost exclusively the restrictive, titular sense. [...] One {{of the effects of the}} Reformation was to eliminate the abuses of the cult of saints, and as a result, it is a common misconception that Lutherans do not have (or rather, do not venerate) saints. However, the confessional documents of the Lutheran Church, particularly the Augsburg Confession, accept both the general and particular use of the word saints. [...] In regards to the titular sense, the Augsburg Confession commends that [...] "it should be taught among us that saints should be kept in remembrance so that our faith may be strengthened when <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> grace they received and how they were sustained in faith. Moreover, their good works are to be an example for us, each of us in his own calling." [...] Article XXI of The Apology to the Augsburg Confession goes further to describe three types of honor which are due to the saints and acknowledgment that the saints pray for the Church. However, the Augsburg Confession opposes prayer to saints, stating, [...] "Scripture does not teach calling on the saints or pleading for help from them. For it sets before us Christ alone as mediator, atoning sacrifice, high priest, and intercessor." ...|$|E

One stop is at a commune in the city park, where Kid sees two women reading a spiral notebook. When Kid looks at it, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he reads: The first page contains, word-for-word, the first sentences of Dhalgren.

2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei, former {{director}} general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote that [...] "the only way to resolve the Iranian issue is to build trust. Moving 1200, half, or at least {{more than half of the}} Iranian nuclear material out of Iran is a confidence-building measure would defuse the crisis and enable the US and the West [...] the space to negotiate.
