500|$|... "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] {{is a song}} {{written in}} 1921 with lyrics by Noble Sissle and music by Eubie Blake for the Broadway show Shuffle Along. [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] {{was the most popular}} number of the production, which was the first financially {{successful}} Broadway play to have African-American writers and an all African-American cast. [...] The song broke what had been a taboo against musical and stage depictions of romantic love between African-Americans.|$|E
500|$|The {{resulting}} show adapted {{plot and}} characters from Miller and Aubrey's Vaudeville comic sketches with music by Blake and Sissle. [...] Although {{the music of}} Shuffle Along was new to the public, only three compositions were actually written for the production: [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry", [...] "Bandana Days", and [...] "Love Will Find A Way". [...] The other songs used in the show were material that Blake and Sissle had tried unsuccessfully to sell to Tin Pan Alley. [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] and [...] "Love Will Find a Way" [...] in particular were politically risky for the era.|$|E
500|$|Alec Wilder and James T. Maher call [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] a [...] "strong, direct, simple song, the {{principal}} device {{of which is}} a strong fourth beat tied to the down beat".

500|$|In 1948 [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] {{underwent}} a revival when Harry S. Truman selected {{it as his}} campaign song for {{the presidency of the}} United States. Republicans and some Democrats that year joked, [...] "I'm just mild about Harry." [...] The next year Al Jolson performed it in the film Jolson Sings Again and the song became a jazz standard. This return to popularity briefly reunited Blake and Sissle {{for the first time since}} 1933. In 1955, the song again appeared in the Warner Brothers cartoon short One Froggy Evening as one of the songs sung by Michigan J. Frog during his dance routine. Kathy Linden released a version of the song on her 1958 album, That Certain Boy. Writing about American popular songs in 1972, Wilder and Maher call [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] the only enduringly popular song from Shuffle Along.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] was {{the most}} popular number of the show. Blake {{conducted}} the show's orchestra and recorded the song for the Victor label. Noble Sissle's 1937 recording for the Victory label altered the original tone considerably in order to showcase the talents of clarinetist Sidney Bechet. Other early recordings include those by Benny Krueger, Louis Mitchell and Paul Whiteman.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] {{underwent}} a complete rewrite during rehearsals and was nearly {{cut from the}} show. Blake's original version of the song was a Viennese waltz, {{but according to the}} authors of America's Songs, performer Lottie Gee encouraged rewriting the number as an up-tempo one-step. Blake disliked the suggestion and feared it would ruin his waltz but capitulated after Sissle agreed with Gee.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{written as}} a waltz, Blake rewrote the number as a foxtrot at the singer's request. [...] The {{result was a}} simple, direct, joyous, and {{infectious}} tune enhanced onstage by improvisational dancing. [...] In 1948 Harry S. Truman selected [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] as his campaign song for the United States presidential election of 1948. Its success in politics led to a popular revival.|$|E
500|$|The crooning craze was at {{its height}} during this time and the [...] "bobby soxer" [...] and [...] "swooner" [...] teenage girls who were <b>wild</b> <b>about</b> Sinatra added Como to their list. A [...] "swooners" [...] club voted him [...] "Crooner of the Year" [...] in 1943. The line for a Perry Como Paramount {{performance}} was three deep and wound around the city block. Como's popularity also extended to a more mature audience when he played the Versailles {{and returned to the}} Copacabana, where the management placed [...] "SRO-Swooning Ruled Out" [...] cards on their tables.|$|E
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also lauded {{the three}} {{principal}} actors' achievements, especially Radcliffe: [...] "One of {{the joys of}} this film is watching Daniel Radcliffe grow so impressively {{into the role of}} Harry. He digs deep into the character and into Harry's nightmares. It's a sensational performance, touching all the bases from tender to fearful". Rolling Stones review also classified the film as better than the previous four instalments in the series, by losing the [...] "candy-ass aspect" [...] of the first two and [...] "raising the bar" [...] from the [...] "heat and resonance" [...] of the third and fourth. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film [...] "the best of the series so far, [...] the laughs, the jitters and the juice to make even nonbelievers <b>wild</b> <b>about</b> Harry".|$|E

500|$|Both [...] "I'm Just <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry" [...] and {{the show}} Shuffle Along broke racial taboos. During the early 20th century African-Americans were {{excluded}} from most mainstream theater in the United States: white Vaudeville refused to book more than one African-American act on a bill and {{for over a decade}} no Broadway show used African-American performers at all. Blake and Sissle met F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles {{for the first time at}} a fundraising benefit for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1920. Vaudeville's exclusionary practices limited bills to one African-American act per night, so as a result the two leading African-American acting teams knew of each other only by reputation. [...] The four performers agreed that the only feasible way for African-Americans to return to Broadway with dignity would be musical comedy. [...] Miller proposed they collaborate.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt's {{performance}} in Hear My Song had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast {{him in his}} 1998 feature film Waking Ned. Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, <b>Wild</b> <b>About</b> Harry. Lowney had personally asked him {{to appear in the}} supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I {{thought it would be a}} little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." [...] The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|James Hubert Blake (February 7, 1887– February 12, 1983), {{known as}} Eubie Blake, was an American composer, lyricist, and pianist of ragtime, jazz, and popular music.
