5000|$|Persicaria {{amphibia}} (syn. Polygonum amphibium) is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the knotweed family known by several common names, including longroot smartweed, water knotweed, <b>water</b> <b>smartweed,</b> and amphibious bistort. It is native to much of North America, Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa, and it is known elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes a noxious weed.|$|E
40|$|On 14 June 1994 we {{collected}} a living specimen of Valvata lewisii morph ontariensis at the Cottonwood Lake Study Area, Stutsman County, North Dakota. The voucher specimen {{is housed in}} the aquatic invertebrate collection at Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center. We captured the specimen in a funnel trap (Swanson 1978) in the shallow marsh zone of a seasonal wetland. This {{is in contrast to}} the typical habitats for this species, which are large lakes and rivers (Clarke 1981). Water depth at the site where {{we collected}} Valvata lewisii ontariensis was 33 cm. Shallow marsh plants in the wetland included <b>water</b> <b>smartweed</b> (Polygonum amphibium), turion duckweed (Lemna turionifera), slough sedge (Carex atherodes), star duckweed (Lemna trisulca), and whitetop (Scolochloa festucacea) ...|$|E

For this reason, an investigation was undertaken with a view to determining the efficacy {{of the effects of the}} brute aqueous extract (BAE) of the leaves of Psidium guajava (guava), Stachytarpheta cayenensis (bastard vervain), Polygonum punctatum (<b>water.</b> <b>smartweed),</b> Eugenia uniflora (Brazil or Surinam cherry) and Aster squamatus (zé-da-silva) on the intestinal transport of water in rats and on the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice. With the exception of the BAE of S. cayenensis, all other BAE's have increased the absorption of water in one or more intestinal portion in relation to the control group. All tested BAE, except that of P. punctatum, reduced the gastrointestinal propulsion in relation to that of the control group. The results indicate that the BAE of the leaves of P. guajava, S. cayenensis, P. punctatum, E. uniflora and A. squamatus have a potential antidiarrhoeic effect to be confirmed by additional investigations in animals infected with enteropathogenic agents.

Para combater a diarréia muitas vezes as pessoas utilizam extratos de plantas conhecidas popularmente como anti-diarréicas, mesmo sem base científica. Em razão disto, verificou-se o efeito do extrato aquoso bruto (EAB) das folhas da Psidium guajava (goiabeira), Stachytarpheta cayenensis (gervão), Polygonum punctatum (polígono ou pimenta d'água), Eugenia uniflora (pitangueira) e Aster squamatus (zé-da-silva) no transporte intestinal de água em ratos e na propulsão gastrointestinal em camundongos. Com exceção do EAB de S. cayenensis, os demais aumentaram a absorção de água em uma ou mais porções do intestino em relação ao grupo-controle. Todos os EAB testados, com exceção do P. punctatum, reduziram o trânsito intestinal em relação ao grupo-controle. Com base nos resultados obtidos conclui-se que os EAB das folhas de P. guayava, S. cayenensis, P. punctatum, E. uniflora e A. squamatus têm potencial ação anti-diarréica, a ser confirmada em novas investigações em animais infectados por agentes enteropatogênicos.
