5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only implied in the entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E
500|$|A year later, at the 2010 Canadian Open, Raonic and Pospisil {{were given}} a doubles {{wildcard}} to the main draw, marking Raonic's first ever ATP World Tour doubles match. They won their first round match against Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. It was {{first time that the}} world Nos. 1 and 2 had played together in a tour doubles match since Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe did so in 1976. In the second round, Raonic and Pospisil lost to reigning Wimbledon doubles champions Jürgen Melzer and Philipp Petzschner. After the match, Raonic said: [...] "Our goal here is pretty much as ambassadors to Canada. The more players that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> come, the more people we can get going to take tennis lessons." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo has {{hoped to}} target a wider {{demographic}} with its console {{than that of}} others in the seventh generation. At a press conference for the then-upcoming Nintendo DS game [...] in December 2006, Satoru Iwata insisted [...] "We're not thinking about fighting Sony, but about how many people <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, but that we want to get new people playing games." [...] This is reflected in Nintendo's series of television advertisements in North America (directed by Academy Award winner Stephen Gaghan) and its Internet ads. The advertising slogans were [...] "Wii would like to play" [...] and [...] "Experience a new way to play"; the ads began November 15, 2006, and had a total budget of over US$200million for the year. The productions were Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and included a two-minute video clip showing an assortment of people enjoying the Wii system: urban apartment-dwellers, ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children. The music in the ads was from the song [...] "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" [...] by the Yoshida Brothers. The marketing campaign was successful; pensioners as old as 103 were reported to be playing the Wii in the United Kingdom. A report by the British newspaper The People also stated that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom has used the console.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the fans}} {{generally}} {{did not like}} the brown pants, and after being used for only one season, the team returned to their white shirt-on-white pants in 2010. Coach Eric Mangini told The Plain Dealer the Browns won't use the brown pants anymore. [...] "It wasn't very well-received," [...] Mangini said. [...] "I hope <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the point where we can wear fruit on our heads and people wouldn't notice." [...] At the time, the brown pants weren't officially dropped by the team, but simply not used.|$|E
2500|$|The author {{describes}} the main {{subject of his}} book as [...] "thin-slicing": our ability to use limited information from a very narrow period of experience {{to come to a}} conclusion. This idea suggests that spontaneous decisions are often as good as—or even better than—carefully planned and considered ones. To reinforce his ideas, Gladwell draws {{from a wide range of}} examples from science and medicine (including malpractice suits), sales and advertising, gambling, speed dating (and predicting divorce), tennis, military war games, and the movies and popular music. [...] Gladwell also uses many examples of regular people's experiences with [...] "thin-slicing," [...] including our instinctive ability to mind-read, which is how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know a person's emotions just by looking at his or her face.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of David Kastan, [...] "this {{is as close as}} <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> an {{expression}} of [...] own belief, and might well be taken as conclusive evidence [...] ". A. L. Rowse (2013), for instance, insisted that the statement in Shakespeare's Will shows a conformist position to Protestant religion. Kastan discusses how some might see the phrase [...] "through thonlie merittes of Jesus Christe" [...] as a reference to the doctrine of solus Christus, {{but at the same time}} he argues that the expression [...] "might have become merely conventional by 1616, and have little or any theological import". Thus, he asserts that this can hardly be considered as an ultimate evidence to define Shakespeare's religious affiliation, since the preamble was formulaic in the epoch.|$|E

2500|$|On May 19, 2009 {{the team}} {{revealed}} their {{findings to the}} world {{at a press conference}} simultaneously with online publication of the paper in PLoS ONE (for naming purposes, the paper was officially published in print on May 21, 2009). The paper included a statement that the authors were not advocating the possibility that the species could be ancestral to later anthropoid primates; Professor John Fleagle, of Stony Brook University in New York state, asserted {{that he was one of}} the anonymous scientific reviewers of the paper and that he had explicitly requested before publication that the authors tone down their original claims that the fossil was on the human evolutionary line. At the press conference the fossil was described as the [...] "missing link" [...] in human evolution. Hurum said that “this fossil rewrites our understanding of the evolution of primates...it will probably be pictured in all the textbooks for the next 100 years" [...] and compared its importance to the Mona Lisa. He also said that Darwinius was [...] "the closest thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a direct ancestor" [...] and that finding it was [...] "a dream come true". Team member Jens Franzen said the state of preservation was [...] "like the Eighth Wonder of the World", with information [...] "palaeontologists can normally only dream of", but while he said it bore [...] "a close resemblance to ourselves" [...] in some aspects, other features indicated that it was not a direct ancestor.|$|E
