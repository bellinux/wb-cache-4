25|$|Court 15 {{may have}} {{originally}} had a <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the courtyard, {{though this is}} not known for certain. By the 1880s, a single tap had been installed. The brick paved yard contains an open drain running {{in front of the}} three back houses.

500|$|All {{utilities}} except electricity {{are managed}} by Komunalno poduzeće Zaprešić (...) [...] Zaprešić's electricity is, {{as in the}} rest of Croatia, provided by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, and distributed by Elektra Zagreb, a company managing access to electricity in Zagreb, and Zagreb County. Zaprešić receives tap water from underground water reserves through a <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the settlement of Šibice. The water from the water pump is of drinking quality. However, local factories Pliva, and Kvasac produce waste water, which is released into the Sava River through the Harmica-Pliva-Zaprešić water treatment plant. Before the construction of the treatment plant, the polluted water was piped into the Gorjak Creek, endangering the tap water quality. Possible consequences of releasing waste water into the Sava will be dealt with by the construction of the Zajarki water purification system for screening the used water. The ecological problem is multiplied {{by the fact that the}} utility company received only 400 requests to clean septic tanks in 2007, although most households in the relatively rural surroundings of Zaprešić use septic systems. There are plans of constructing four hydroelectric power plants around Zagreb with one being in Zaprešić (HE Zaprešić, also known as HE Podsused) as a part of a system of exploiting natural resources of the Sava River.|$|E
2500|$|Some marine aquariums {{include a}} sump, {{which is an}} {{external}} container connected to the main aquarium with a <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> <b>In</b> most setups, the sump is located below the aquarium and is fed water from the main tank via an overflow. An overflow at its simplest is a round hole drilled towards {{the top of the}} tank, connected via tubing to an output below it. As the water level increases past the height of the overflow, the water [...] "overflows" [...] the tank and falls through to the sump below. The water circulation is powered by a <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the sump, which pushes the water back into the tank, thus causing more water to flow over and perpetuating the cycle. There are many advantages to using a sump, both for the appearance and the health of the tank. The sump helps the appearance of the tank, because it allows filtration and maintenance equipment (protein skimmer, heater, activated carbon) to be kept {{out of sight of the}} main tank. It also ensures that the water level of the main aquarium never changes, as the overflow sets the water level in the main tank. The sump aids tank health by helping to oxygenate the water by increasing the amount of water/air surface area used for gas exchange.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1840s, surgery {{began to}} change {{dramatically}} in character {{with the discovery of}} effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long (1815–1878), and chloroform, discovered by James Young Simpson (1811–1870) and later pioneered in England by John Snow (1813–1858), physician to Queen Victoria, who in 1853 administered chloroform to her during childbirth, and in 1854 disproved the miasma theory of contagion by tracing a cholera outbreak in London to an infected <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> <b>In</b> addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. [...] In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications. [...] American surgeon J. Marion Sims (1813–83) received credit for helping found Gynecology, but later was criticized for failing to use anesthesia on African test subjects.|$|E
2500|$|Christian Thams {{understood}} {{that for the}} mine to continue operation, {{there had to be}} built an electric <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> <b>in</b> the mines. He also {{understood that}} it would then be feasible to build an electric railway between the mine and the port at Thamshavn were the pyrites were shipped out, primarily to Germany. While Thams went abroad to get capital for the new mining company, Norwegian law required that permits to operate railways and power plants only were given to Norwegians. To solve this, a separate company, Chr. Salvesen & Chr. Thams's Communications Aktieselskab (Salvesen & Thams or S) was established in 1898 to build the railway, operate the steam ship [...] between Thamshavn and Trondheim and build the power plant at Skjenaldfossen. By 1904 the mining company had acquired the majority of stocks in S and soon owned the entire company. The Orkla mining company has since evolved into the Orkla Group, a Forbes 500-company.|$|E
