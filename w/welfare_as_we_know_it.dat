Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system.

40|$|Welfare {{reform is}} upon us and many are already making the {{transition}} from welfare to work. There are good reasons to expect that these transitions will benefit many families and children; others, however, may not fare as well. Whether the changes help or hurt depends, in large part, on families ' responses to welfare reform—the way they manage their time, effort, and division of family responsibilities; the impact on their self-esteem, stress levels, and other aspects of mental health; how their income changes; their connections to extra-familial support networks; their strategies for seeking and keeping jobs; whether marriages, partnerships, divorces, or separations ensue; how fathers absent from the household alter their behavior; and how community-level resources and supports change in response to the new welfare regime. The debate preceding the 1996 welfare reform legislation was filled with assertions about how welfare receipt harms family functioning and, depending on the politics of the speaker, how “ending <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> ” either promotes or jeopardizes the well-being of the families and children involved.

40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the twenty-first century American historians are unusually {{qualified}} to advise on social policy. With the passage in 1996 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, much of the nation s system of public assistance for the poor was given back to the states and localities. President Clinton promised to end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> and he did. But President Clinton did not abolish welfare: in dimensions financial, legal, administrative, and moral, too polyphonous to name here, the new system is trying to revive welfare as historians of the 1870 s know it. Likewise, with the inauguration of President-elect George W. Bush, the government s social services from poverty alleviation to drug abuse treatment will go, Bush promises, increasingly into the hands of faith-based groups. Of course the economic viability and the constitutionality of the faith-based subsidy is being challenged. And again, history offers ample precedent. The vision of the President-elect, and the immediate reactions against it, are reminiscent of the 1820 s and of the 1870 s 1900 s movement to organize charity. So it is especially fortunate that the historian David C. Hammack has published the essays and excerpts that comprise Making the Nonprofit Sector in the United States: A Reader. ...|$|E
40|$|Bill Clinton in his 1992 presidential {{campaign}} promised that, if elected, {{he would bring}} about the "end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> " This catchy election pledge aimed to address middle class concerns about so-called welfare dependency while also arguing {{that the government had}} an important role to play in fighting poverty and unemployment. Clinton's Third Way position, at best, offered {{a way out of the}} liberal/conservative impasse on how to effectively reform America's welfare system. At worst, Clinton's position undermined the concept of welfare entitlements that the Democratic Party had established in America. As it turned out, in 1996 during the lead up to that year's presidential election, President Clinton signed into law the most significant federal welfare Act since the 1960 s. However, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) that Clinton signed had largely been drafted by congressional Republicans. This article draws on interviews with three of Clinton's senior welfare advisers to examine his welfare reform proposals and politics. It concludes that the failure of Clinton's Third Way welfare agenda opened the way for more conservative reforms. This experience is illustrative of the pitfalls of Third Way politics with its mix of post-entitlement welfare policies and hard-nosed electoral positioning. No Full Tex...|$|E

Many recipients have left the rolls since reform was implemented. States have boasted drastic reductions in benefit receipt since the implementation of federal welfare reform in 1996; yet, this decrease also occurred within the context of record economic prosperity. The coincidence of these two events and the subsequent apparent downturn in the economy complicates our understanding of the effects of welfare reform and its relative success. While a cursory look at the trends of welfare receipt would indicate that the federal reforms targeting individual behavior have effectively caused the reduction in benefits, closer examination of this trend is warranted to understand the economic reality faced by this population. Welfare reform was, in part, {{based on the premise that}} the poor would begin to rely more on jobs, family, friends, and organizations for assistance.

40|$|The {{cash and}} near cash safety net in the U. S. has {{undergone}} a dramatic transformation in the past fifteen years. Federal welfare reform {{has led to the}} “elimination of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> ” and several tax reforms have substantially increased the role of “in-work” ' assistance. In 2010, we spent more than 5 dollars on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for every dollar spent on cash benefits through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), whereas in 1994 on the eve of federal welfare reform these programs were about equal in size. In this paper, we evaluate and test whether the EITC satisfies a defining feature of a safety net program—that it responds to economic need. In particular, we explore how EITC participation and expenditures change with the business cycle. The fact that the EITC requires earned income leads to a theoretical ambiguity in the cyclical responsiveness of the credit. We use administrative IRS data {{to examine the relationship between}} business cycles and the EITC program. Our empirical strategy relies on exploiting differences in the timing and severity of economic cycles across states. The results show that higher unemployment rates lead to higher EITC recipients and total dollar amounts of credits for married couples. On the other hand, the effect of business cycles on the EITC is insignificant for single individuals, whether measured by recipients or expenditures. In sum, our results show that the EITC serves to mitigat...|$|E
40|$|Will {{welfare reform}} {{increase}} unemployment and reduce wages? The answer depends {{in part on}} how much welfare reform increases labor supply. This paper considers the labor supply effects of the welfare reforms that have occurred since 1993, when President Clinton entered office with a promise to "end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> " The paper reviews previous estimates, and provides new estimates, of how many additional labor force participants have entered the labor force due to welfare reform. I estimate that welfare reform from 1993 - 96 increased the U. S. labor force by between 100, 000 and 300, 000 persons. Between 1996, when the major federal welfare reform bill was enacted, and 1998, welfare reform has probably increased the U. S. labor force by at least another 300, 000 persons. Assuming current policy trends continue, welfare reform may add another half-million to one-million labor force participants between 1998 and 2005. The cumulative impact of welfare reform from 1993 - 2005 is likely to add between one and one-and-a-half million persons to the U. S. labor force. This additional labor supply is not huge compared to the U. S. labor force, so welfare reform is unlikely to have large long-run effects on overall wages and unemployment. However, this additional labor supply is large compared to likely growth in labor demand for less-educated women over the 1993 - 2005 period. As a result, welfare reform {{is likely to have}} significant effects on the wages and unemployment rates of less-educated women during the 1993 - 2005 period. welfare, reform, labor, supply, Bartik...|$|E

Tobin advocated means-tested cash transfers (negative income tax), to reduce poverty without interfering with market determination of relative prices (a position shared with Milton Friedman), paired with "non-market egalitarian distributions of commodities essential to life and citizenship" (education, food stamps, basic housing). The latter position contrasted with Friedman's Chicago school approach. Tobin's message continues to be relevant for reduction of poverty and inequality. Tobin's approach is contrasted with the neo-conservative analysis {{of the causes of}} poverty (exemplified by Herrnstein and Murray, but going back to Senior and Chadwick's Poor Law Report of 1834) that has been reflected in "the end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it".

5000|$|The Institute {{was one of}} the key {{institutions}} that pressed for reform of the welfare system in the mid-1990s. Charles Murray, while an Institute fellow from 1981 to 1990, wrote his groundbreaking book Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980 (1984) argued that the welfare state had fostered a culture and cycle of dependency that was to the detriment of both welfare recipients and the United States as a whole. This launched a debate culminating in President Bill Clinton proposing to [...] "end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it" [...] and the passage of landmark federal welfare reform in 1996. More recently, marking the 20th anniversary of federal welfare reform, the Institute published a report by former senior fellow Scott Winship that evaluated the plight of the poor since 1996. He concluded that, contrary to popular opinion, reform was more successful than not, helping move many single mothers off the dole and into the workforce. Furthermore, he reported that children—in particular, those in single-mother families—were significantly less likely to be poor today than they were before welfare reform.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the evolution of the}} programme Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) since 1996. In 1996, the transformation of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) marked a watershed in American social policy. AFDC was the main US public assistance programme for single parents. By the mid- 1990 s, it was also the most unpopular social programme in the United States, which explained why Bill Clinton promised to ‘end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it’ during his presidential campaign in 1996. TANF ended automatic individual entitlement to public assistance, established a five-year time limit for receiving cash assistance, and promoted a punitive approach towards welfare recipients, who were in theory increasingly required to work in exchange for benefits. This approach is known as the Work First Approach. Cash assistance was temporary, and granted as a favour to low-income mothers, who were required to comply with various behavioural requirements. TANF was hailed as a tremendous success {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum. This bipartisan consensus explains why the new Republican administration (G. W.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that economists and policymakers alike {{had been living}} a 30 -year fantasy. The best government is not that which governs least. The best economy is not that which is abandoned to the invisible fist of the unconstrained market. Our national and individual security is not best left {{to the fate of}} the private pursuit of maximum profit. The events of September 11 underscored what was already apparent: Big Government needs to play a bigger role in our economy. Our late Levy Institute colleague Hyman Minsky has been vindicated once more. Three decades ago, President Nixon and Milton Friedman declared, "We're all Keynesians now. " The announcement came at nearly the precise moment at which Keynesianism had lost currency among economists and policymakers alike. Since then, Keynesian economic policy has remained out of favor both in the ivory towers of academia and Washington, D. C. Arguments advocating fiscal responsibility, "small" government, and limited government "intervention " were propounded. While university classrooms reverberated with paeans to invisible hands and Walrasian auctioneers, the halls of Congress were filled with praise for the wonders of unbridled free markets. Every U. S. president from Jimmy Carter forward reduced the presence of government in our society. President Reagan "got the government off the backs of the people, " while President Clinton "ended <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> " withdrawing the safety net that protected needy Americans. Social spending was slashed, but federal income and corporate taxes were cut more, resulting in huge budget deficits throughout the Reagan, Bush, and early Clinton administrations.

40|$|The American {{welfare reform}} – “ending <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> ” – has been {{hailed as a}} great success. Welfare rolls have {{declined}} by half. Policy makers and politicians are claiming that poor single mothers are no longer dependent and are making successful progress as workers in the paid labor force. The American workfare experience has had a significant influence in Western Europe. Several countries, in rejecting the “passive ” welfare state, have instituted “active labor market policies ” for the long-term unemployed, unemployed youth, lone parents, and various groups lumped together as the “socially excluded. ” The goal is one of “inclusion, ” to bring dependent people back into society. By making labor more “flexible” and creating incentives to take work rather than welfare, {{there will be a}} significant increase in employment. This paper examines the American experience. What accounts for the dramatic decline in welfare rolls – welfare reform or the economy? The welfare rolls were declining significantly before the 1996 reforms. The best estimates are that only about 15 percent of the decline is due to welfare reform, the rest to the significant expansion of low-wage work during the 1990 s. Furthermore, about half of the 15 percent was due to excluding families from welfare – both diversion and sanctions have been widespread. Welfare offices favor those who are the most employable. And what has been happening to welfare leavers? A little over half are working, but jobs disappear, child care breaks down, and most are in poverty. There is significant unemployment. There is very little information on those who have been sanctioned or denied welfare. Thus, contrary to assumptions behind the American welfare reform and the glowing pronouncements of success, poverty and hardship remain, and with the recent slowdown in employment, an increase in hunger and homelessness. The “success ” of welfare reform provides an excuse for ignoring the structural issues of the low-wage labor market and poverty. Institut de Drets humans de Catalunya | www. idhc. org...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{models are}} the icons {{of a new}} welfare policy and {{practice}} in Australia, writes Paul Smyth • TONY ABBOTT’s call for “firm but fair” welfare reforms should make us all {{stop and think about}} the state of welfare in Australia today. There are indeed too many people excluded from the economic mainstream. The question is, why? Mr Abbott focuses on the supposed role of income support in undermining the incentive to work. His reform pathway relies on tougher compliance regimes.   We would support an emphasis on individuals doing their bit. But today unemployment is essentially a structural problem. Being unemployed is not primarily about the money, it’s about the lack of skills, relevant work experience and often robust health. A new social contract is needed which demands responsibility but also guarantees individuals’ effective access to the support and resources they need to make effective choices about their lives.    The “tough love” approach is too tied to the negative welfare thinking of the 1990 s, when unemployment welfare was seen as at odds with the free market economic agenda. Australia’s distinctive form of welfare protection through the wage system was largely dismantled, social services were deemed to be better off privatized, and commentators were inclined to proclaim the end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Social policy shrank to the dimensions of “welfare,” and “reform” became identified with getting people off income support. But surely this agenda belongs to the past. It didn’t work for the unemployed, and it doesn’t meet the needs of employers for job ready workers. Moreover, this old style thinking underestimates the importance of social investment not only for the economy but for ensuring that growth is inclusive. Around the world, the thinking behind the 1990 s paradigm is in decline. The new imperative is what the World Bank calls “inclusive growth. ” This is the new social policy approach that Australia sorely needs. Work for the Dole was the flagship program of the old agenda and the research shows that it actually reduced employment outcomes. The current employment assistance system works reasonable well for the majority of “job ready” unemployed. But it continues to fail highly disadvantaged job seekers, with participants churned through the system, placements in meaningless activities which don’t build job readiness or skills matched to labour needs and high drop-out rates from the labour force. Only a quarter of highly disadvantaged job seekers achieve a positive outcome comprising either full or part-time work or training. Convinced by the need for a new approach for the long-term unemployed, the Brotherhood of St Laurence has created a new program which it calls the Line of Sight (PDF). Working with our clients we saw that overwhelming they are not morally or behaviourally impaired individuals dodging their responsibilities. What they lack is an accessible service which shows them a clear pathway to a decent job via integrated support, work placement and training. What works is not the “big stick” approach but a commitment to connecting disadvantaged jobseekers with decent sustainable work. We see integrated models as the icons of a new welfare policy and practice in Australia. Through these we can offer excluded people a meaningful investment in a future they value. And this approach will better meet the growing recruitment needs of employers for entry level workers who have the foundational skills to sustain paid work. We are delighted that the Victorian government is making a major new investment in these programs. The British government is also showing the way forward through its new Work Programme, which will invest in disadvantaged job seekers to enable a pathway to sustainable employment. One approach that should be developed is the “off benefits” model, whereby the government uses future savings from reduced income support payments to provide paid real work opportunities directly with employers, who are then assisted  through the delivery of an integrated package of support and foundational training by contracted organisations.    More generally the emerging political debate points to the need for a social policy paradigm shift in Australia. What we need is a model which better integrates our social and economic goals. Economic growth alone is not enough. It must translate into individual flourishing and social inclusion. International policy agencies from the UN to the EU are adamant today that while growth can be inclusive it won’t be without an appropriate social policy regime. This is the inclusive growth agenda. •Professor Paul Smyth is a Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne and General Manager of the Research and Policy Centre at the Brotherhood of St Laurence Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E

These changes began {{as far back}} as the mid- 1980 s and culminated with the 1996 welfare law that “ended <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it. ” These tax and welfare changes have sharply increased the employment of single mothers and cut welfare rolls. However, little is know about the effects of these policy changes on the material well-being of single mothers and their children. Studies of those leaving welfare have found that a substantial percentage have problems paying rent, purchasing enough food, and paying utility bills. Other studies found a decline in income among the worst-off single mothers after 1994 or 1995. The goal of this paper is to examine the material well-being of single mothers and their families before and after recent welfare and tax reforms. Using data from two nationally representative household surveys we examine the consumption patterns of single mothers and their families. We find that the material conditions of single mothers did not decline in recent years, either in absolute terms or relative to single childless women or married mothers. This pattern holds for the average single mother as well as for low-educated single mothers at both the 15 th and 25 th percentiles of the consumption distribution.

In the United States, the term "welfare" is {{most commonly used}} to refer to the program for single mothers and their families, formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and now, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF).

The principal focus of the 1996 reform is mandatory work requirements enforced by sanctions and strict time limits on welfare receipt. While PRWORA's emphasis on work is not new, the difference is its significant ideological and policy commitment to employment, enforced by time limits. When welfare reform was enacted, some of its proponents recognized that welfare offices would have to change in order to develop individualized workfare plans, monitor progress, and impose sanctions. The "culture" of welfare offices had to be changed from being solely concerned with eligibility and compliance to individual, intensive casework. In this article, I will discuss how implementing workfare programs have influenced the relationship between clients and their workers at the welfare office. I start by describing the burdens faced by offices even before the enactment of welfare reform. Local welfare offices were expected to run programs that emphasized compliance and eligibility at the same time as workfare programs, which require intensive, personal case management. The next section of the paper will focus on strategies welfare offices and workers use to navigate these contradictory expectations. Lastly, I will present information on how clients react to workfare programs and some reasons they acquiesce to workfare contracts despite their unmet needs. I conclude with recommendations of how to make workfare truly work for welfare clients...|$|R

These {{pressures and}} trends underline the twin challenge to the Nordics of productivity stagnation and a decreasing work force. A contribution to an answer to both challenges can {{be an increase in}} productivity and new ways to increase the work force. A good work environment can do both. In this context, the Nordic Council of Ministers has initiated a project aiming at clarifying the impact on productivity of work environment and well-being in companies. This report presents an indicator manual for use in measuring work environment in the Nordic countries. The report also outlines and defines a common Nordic concept of work wellbeing. The indicators serve as important first steps on the way to thorough econometric analysis of the relationship between work environment, well-being, and productivity...|$|R
5000|$|It was not however {{until the}} 1980s that U.S. food banks began to enjoy rapid growth. A second {{response}} to the [...] "rediscovery" [...] of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact. In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice {{in the same way}} as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, president Reagan's administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. But in the decades that followed, food banks have become an accepted part of America's response to hunger. Demand for the services of US food bank increased further in the late 1990s, after the [...] "end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it" [...] with President Clinton's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In Canada, foodbanks underwent a period of rapid growth after the cutbacks in welfare that took place in the mid-1990s. As early as the 1980s, food banks had also begun to spread from the United States to the rest of the world. The first European food bank was founded in France during 1984. In the 1990s and early 2000s, food banks were established in South America, Africa and Asia, in several cases with van Hengel acting as a consultant. In 2007, The Global FoodBanking Network was formed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: “Prioritizing in Health Care – A {{challenge}} of the Welfare State?” It is a common fact that all resources are restricted. Health welfare {{becomes more and more}} expensive, due to better medication, new technology and administration. There is a need for prioritizing, but who has the responsibility, and how should it be done? In this report, you will read about where the prioritizing takes place in Denmark in different levels, and how prioritizing through economical evaluations afflict the social differences in the welfare state. In Great Britain and Norway the solution have been to collect all the different parts of involved in prioritizing, in one national prioritizing-council. Not only due to economical reasons, but also because of democratic difficulties in relation to prioritizing without informing the citizens about how it is done, and who is doing it. We have performed interviews with a medical doctor and a health economist to help us answer our questions and to use their knowledge and experience in our analysis. We have concluded that the prioritizing could be threatening the social equality, and therefore also threatening the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>We</b> have also concluded {{that a lot of people}} see a national council not only as a good idea, but also as a solution to the problems involved with prioritizing as of today...|$|R
40|$|Europe is {{witnessing}} general {{attempts at}} a reformulation of the post-war social contract which {{gave rise to}} the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it (with public higher education <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it). I argue here for a strong thesis according to which Europe is facing the simultaneous renegotiation of the postwar social contract concerning the welfare state and the accompanying renegotiation of a smaller-scale, by comparison, modern social pact between the university and the nation-state. The renegotiation of the (nation) state/ university pact is not clear outside of the context of the changing <b>welfare</b> state contract, <b>as</b> state-funded higher education formed one of the bedrocks of the European welfare system in its major forms, and state-funded higher education remains one of its foundations. I am following here Stephan Leibfried and colleagues who argue that “competitive pressure to lower tax rates undermines the state’s resources and has the potential to unleash financial crises that, in turn, trigger cuts in welfare spending” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 7). Consequently, what they term “the golden-age "onstellation” of the four components of the state (the territorial state, the constitutional state, the democratic welfare state and the interventionist state) is currently threatened: “different state functions are threatened {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, and subjected to pressures for internationalization of varying intensity” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 9). I argue here that higher education policies, and especially public funding for universities, are one of the dimensions of the “golden-age constellation” under renegotiations in Europe today: they come under the “interventionist state” and its functions in Leibfried’s formulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of a}} Basic Income Grant (BIG) has {{for long}} been an {{appealing}} alternative to the means-tested social security nets associated with the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it. Proponents of BIG highlight as comparative advantages its unconditionality, its inclusiveness and its administrative simplicity. Moreover, as capital-intensive investment and demographic evolutions engender a decline in activity rates, social security nets that rely on labour as both a source of financing and a condition for entry seem more and more untenable. These latter systems have however for long been in place and have a firm historical embeddedness. Hence, the introduction of BIG requires a revolutionary momentum. South Africa {{has gone through a}} period of profound societal change over the last two decades. After decades of racial exclusion, post-apartheid opened the pursuit of a progressive social inclusionary politics. South Africa {{has been one of the}} few countries where social security expenditure has been steadily on the rise since the second half of the 1990 s. The ANC-government has opted to strengthen several targeted grants (pensions, child grant, etc.), leaving the searing unemployed active population uncovered. This article contends that the introduction of a modest BIG, alongside the pre-existing grant system is a feasible and promising option as it would have a considerable beneficial effect on poverty without entailing large costs. This position is shared among an impressive coalition of civil society organisations and political parties. The article inquires why the ANC, in these conditions, shuns away from the introduction of BIG. We conclude that, how ripe South Africa may be for BIG, the ANC-ideology pushes government to strengthen the workfare-approach, including employment programmes, over a radical overhaul of the social security system. ...|$|R
