500|$|Scholarship {{since the}} 1970s {{has tended to}} move away from a pure study of iconography, instead {{emphasizing}} the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, [...] "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> these were." [...] Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a [...] "prayer book mentality" [...] available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.|$|E

[...] Some observers concluded that the reaction by the public to vote for Hank was a veiled commentary on how the media assumes that the masses are easily manipulated into liking what is marketed to them. The New York Times quoted a participant in the poll as stating, [...] "The 'media' tells us what food to eat, what movies to see, what music to listen to, who to vote for politically and <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> are attractive enough to have relationships with!...Voting for 'Hank the Dwarf' is a reflection of how the people really feel about media!" ...|$|E

This would involve the government in making complex dynamic portfolio decisions for individuals.

60|$|There was a {{beautiful}} wild desert island lying across {{the opening of a}} bay; the isle was full of wild goats, and made a bar against the waves, so that ships could lie behind it safely, run up on the beach, for there was no tide in that sea. There Ulysses ran up his ships, and the men passed the time in hunting wild goats, and feasting on fresh meat and the wine of Maron, the priest of Apollo. Next day Ulysses left all the ships and men there, except his own ship, and his own crew, and went to see <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> lived on the mainland, for as yet none had been seen. He found a large cave close to the sea, with laurels growing on the rocky roof, and a wall of rough stones built round a court in front. Ulysses left all his men but twelve with the ship; filled a goat skin with the strong wine of Maron, put some corn flour in a sack, and went up to the cave. Nobody was there, but there were all the things that are usually in a dairy, baskets full of cheese, pails and bowls full of milk and whey, and kids and lambs were playing in their folds.|$|E
40|$|Waste Facilities (RWF) have {{generated}} social conflicts. They are usually regarded {{as some of}} the riskiest objects in the world. However, if we take account of their characteristics and specifications, we can see that NPS and RWF are largely different risk objects; the former is positive and beneficial in its role as an environmentally friendly energy source with no polluted materials whereas the latter is negative in that it is waste material giving no benefit to society. The two objects have different attributes. However, most people didn’t tend to distinguish two objects. Thus it is questionable <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> do or do not distinguish between the risks of NPS and RWF with rational or analytic power. Our research questions start from whether is possible for individuals to distinguish similar but different risks. We empirically explore who distinguishes between the risks of NPS and RWF. There are many studies about the risk perception of NPS and RWF (Fischhoff et al. 1978; Tanaka 2004). They demonstrate which <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> variables and characteristics can explain the variances among people regarding risk perception. For example...|$|R

6000|$|After {{they had}} passed some fifteen days at {{their place of}} rest and refreshment, a letter came from Major Pendennis announcing his speedy arrival at Rosenbad, and, soon after the letter, the Major himself made his {{appearance}} accompanied by Morgan his faithful valet, without whom the old gentleman could not move. When the Major travelled he wore a jaunty and juvenile travelling costume; to see his back still you would have taken him {{for one of the}} young fellows whose slim waist and youthful appearance Warrington was beginning to envy. It was not until the worthy man began to move, that the observer remarked that Time had weakened his ancient knees, and had unkindly interfered to impede the action of the natty little varnished boots in which the gay old traveller still pinched his toes. There were magnates both of our own country and of foreign nations present that autumn at Rosenbad. The elder Pendennis read over the strangers' list with great gratification on the night of his arrival, was pleased to find several of his acquaintances among the great folks, and would have the honour of presenting his nephew to a German Grand Duchess, a Russian Princess, and an English Marquis, before many days were over: nor was Pen by any means averse to making the acquaintance of these great personages, having a liking for polite life, and all the splendours and amenities belonging to it. That very evening the resolute old gentleman, leaning on his nephew's arm, made his appearance in the halls of the Kursaal, and lost or won a napoleon or two at the table of 'Trente-et-quarante.' He did not play to lose, he said, or to win, but he did as other folks did, and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came. He pointed out the Russians and Spaniards gambling for heaps of gold, and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous; an English gentleman should play where the fashion is play, but should not elate or depress himself at the sport; and he told how he had seen his friend the Marquis of Steyne, when Lord Gaunt, lose eighteen thousand at a sitting, and break the bank three nights running at Paris, without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory. [...] "And that's what I call being an English gentleman, Pen, my dear boy," [...] the old gentleman said, warming as he prattled about his recollections--"what I call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in France." [...] And as Russian Princesses passed him, whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful, and damaged English ladies, who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation, the old Major, with eager garrulity and mischievous relish, told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines; and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals. Egad, he felt himself quite young again, he remarked to Pen, as, rouged and grinning, her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl, the Princess Obstropski smiled and recognised and accosted him. He remembered her in '14 when she was an actress of the Paris Boulevard, and the Emperor Alexander's aide-de-camp Obstropski (a man of great talents, who knew a good deal about the Emperor Paul's death, and was a devil to play) married her. He most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the Princess, and to present to her his nephew, Mr. Arthur Pendennis; and he pointed out to the latter a half-dozen of other personages whose names were as famous, and whose histories were as satisfying. What would poor Helen have thought, could she have heard those tales, or known to <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> her brother-in-law was presenting her son? Only once, leaning on Arthur's arm, she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play, and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of Rouge gagne and Couleur perd. She had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium, imploring Pen, extorting from him a promise, on his word of honour, that he would never play at those tables; and the scene which so frightened the simple widow, only amused the worldly old veteran, and made him young again! He could breathe the air cheerfully which stifled her. Her right was not his right: his food was her poison. Human creatures are constituted thus differently, and with this variety the marvellous world is peopled. To the credit of Mr. Pen, let it be said, that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother, and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it.|$|E
