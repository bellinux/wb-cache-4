5|$|From the league's {{founding}} in 1920 until 1932, {{there was no}} scheduled championship game. From 1920–1923, the championship was awarded to a team {{by a vote of}} team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924–1932, the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship. As each team played a different number of games, simply counting <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties count as ½ win and ½ loss).|$|E
5|$|That {{victory was}} {{followed}} by consecutive losses, however, against UCLA and No. 1-ranked Florida. Tennessee ended its losing streak with a win against Ohio, then began alternating <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> The victory against Ohio {{was followed by}} a loss to Auburn. A win against Georgia preceded a loss to No. 2 Alabama on a last-second blocked field goal and a win against No. 22 South Carolina. After South Carolina, Tennessee beat Memphis to create its first winning streak of the season. That streak abruptly ended the following week, when Tennessee lost to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} online play using Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network services.

5|$|The 1948 Cleveland Indians {{season began}} with Black {{maintaining}} {{a spot in}} the starting rotation. He had spent the off-season selling tickets for the Indians in Hot Springs, Arkansas. After signing a new contract, Black earned his first victory of 1948 on May 23 in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, winning 51 in the second game. Early on in the season, due to the Indians' pitching depth, Black, along with Al Gettel and Bob Muncrief, lost their starting jobs and were moved to the bullpen, though there were plans to still use Black occasionally as a starter. He missed some playing time in June {{as the result of a}} bone chip in his left big toe, suffered during batting practice. He pitched for the Indians for most of the rest of the season, making ten starts in 18 total appearances, finishing the season with two <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses,</b> a 5.37 ERA, and 52 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Royals {{were added}} to the American League in a 1969 {{expansion}} after the city's first Major League Baseball franchise departed for Oakland, California. Joe Gordon, one of two Hall of Famers to manage the Royals, was selected as the team's first manager, leading the team for one season. Bob Lemon, who took over during the 1970 season, is the second member of the Hall of Fame to lead the team, and managed until the end of 1972. Whitey Herzog is the franchise leader in regular-season wins (410) and winning percentage (.574), and Tony Muser is the loss leader (431). Dick Howser is the leader in postseason <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> (8–12). Trey Hillman led the Royals for parts of three seasons after a five-year managerial career in Japan, but was fired May 13, 2010, and replaced by current manager Ned Yost.|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Pirates {{joined the}} National League in 1887 after five seasons {{as members of}} the American Association. Al Pratt was the first manager in {{franchise}} history, while the first manager after joining Major League Baseball was Horace B. Phillips. The manager is currently Clint Hurdle. Fred Clarke, who managed from 1900 through 1915, holds franchise records in <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> (1422–969), as well as winning percentage among managers who led the team for a full season or more (.595). Clarke was the first manager to lead the team to the postseason and to win a World Series; other managers to do so include Bill McKechnie (one playoff appearance, one World Series victory), Chuck Tanner (one playoff appearance, one World Series victory), and Danny Murtaugh, who leads franchise managers with two World Series victories and five playoff appearances.|$|E
50|$|In {{their first}} season, the Union played only one game. It was against Young America. Union {{won the game}} 25-8. In the second season, Union played five games.

In the 1862 season, Union placed fourth with five <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> five <b>losses.</b> This encouraged the team and in the 1865 season, they placed third in the league with thirteen <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> ten <b>losses.</b> At the time, this was a franchise record.|$|R
5|$|The Reds {{have played}} in several {{different}} home ball parks. They played two seasons in their first home ball park, Bank Street Grounds, <b>and</b> had one <b>win</b> <b>and</b> one <b>loss</b> in Opening Day games there. The team had a record of six <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> ten <b>losses</b> in Opening Day games at League Park, and a record of three <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> seven <b>losses</b> in Opening Day games at the Palace of the Fans. The Reds played in Crosley Field from 1912 {{through the middle of}} the 1970 season, and had a record of 27 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 31 <b>losses</b> in Opening Day games there. They had an Opening Day record of 19 <b>wins,</b> 11 <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> 1 tie from 1971 through 2002 at Riverfront Stadium, and they have a record of three <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> six <b>losses</b> in Opening Day games at their current home ball park, the Great American Ball Park. That gives the Reds an overall Opening Day record of 59 <b>wins,</b> 66 <b>losses</b> <b>and</b> one tie at home.

5|$|The team {{now known}} as the Cleveland Indians has played under several monikers since its {{inception}} in 1901, including the Cleveland Blues or Bluebirds, the Cleveland Bronchos, and the Cleveland Naps (so named because of popular player and manager Nap Lajoie). Forty managers have led the team, starting with Jimmy McAleer, since it was established in Cleveland, Ohio in 1901. Lajoie was the first manager in team history to finish his career with a winning record. Lou Boudreau leads all Indians managers with 728 wins and 649 losses. He and Tris Speaker are the only managers to win a championship with Cleveland: Speaker in 1920 and Boudreau in 1948, the last championship for the franchise. Other managers to appear in the postseason with Cleveland include Al López, Mike Hargrove (who leads the team in playoff <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> with a record of 27–24), Charlie Manuel, and Eric Wedge. The current manager is Terry Francona.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} 1984 season under head coach Bill Dooley, {{who at the}} time was the winningest coach in Tech history. In 1983, the Hokies had gone 92, with one of the two losses coming at the hands of No. 9 West Virginia in a nationally {{televised}} game. Tech began the 1984 season with a win against Wake Forest, but followed that by a loss against West Virginia {{in one of the most}} contentious college football rivalries in the country at that time. In the two weeks that followed, Tech continued to alternate <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses,</b> reaching an overall record of 22 by the end of the fourth week of the season. Tech's fortunes took a turn for the better during the latter portion of the season, however, as the Hokies proceeded to win six of their final seven games before earning a bid to the 1984 Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame as a player, managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). Clark Griffith is the only other Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise. In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). Kelly is also the franchise leader in <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses,</b> the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired of managerial duties in October 2014, as he was replaced by Paul Molitor.|$|E

50|$|Seto {{became a}} {{professional}} player in 2000 for the Kansai Ki-in. In his first 5 {{years at the}} Kansai Ki-in, he had a spectacular record in the Oteai with 51 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> just 3 <b>losses</b> through 2005. In 2000, he scored 12 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 0 <b>losses.</b> In 2001, he also scored 12 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 0 <b>losses.</b> In 2002 he finally lost his first Oteai match {{with a record of}} 11 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>loss.</b> In 2002 his record was 8 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 2 <b>losses.</b> In the final year of the Oteai, his record was 8 <b>wins</b> <b>and</b> 0 <b>losses.</b> This amounted his Oteai career record to a 94.4% winning percentage. His run was stopped after the Oteai was replaced with a similar system used by the Nihon Ki-in of promotion through title winning. He won the Nagai award in 2000, along with an award for his run of wins. He is currently 7 dan and one of the strongest young players in Japan.|$|R

40|$|The {{pilot study}} used state-of-the art psychophysiological {{equipment}} to monitor, on a second-bysecond basis, skin conductance level (SCL) {{and heart rate}} (HR) of university students (n = 12) in response to <b>win</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events while playing an electronic gaming machine (EGM). Each <b>win</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> event was recorded and physiological changes associated with these events sorted and averaged based on event type (win/loss) and time (pre and post events). Compared to pre-event baselines, both SCL and HR increased following the occurrence of a win but not to a loss event. SCL was the more sensitive of the two measures, yielding a robust and reliable response for wins but not for losses. These results have potentially valuable clinical implications and future research should attempt to capture and compare physiological changes to <b>win</b> <b>and</b> <b>loss</b> events in field settings in both problem and non-problem gamblers...|$|R
