The best position ever achieved by an Itanium2 based system in the list was #2 (<b>while</b> <b>now</b> all systems have dropped off the list), achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.|$|E

500|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification, so Pinot was the last one to start. The riders went off the {{starting}} ramp in two minutes increments. Cancellara got on course early, as he was the seventh man to start. He clocked a time of 48' 55", which would stay a reference for most of the day. He was followed out of the starting area by Matthias Brändle (IAM Cycling) who came in 2' 28" [...] after Cancellara, somewhat surprisingly as he is a time trial specialist too.

[...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive."
