40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a <b>wire</b> <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> Results: <b>Drying</b> on a <b>hay</b> <b>rack</b> produced very good hay. The upper portion of the <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that <b>dried</b> on a <b>wire</b> <b>hay</b> <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage. Upper and lower portion of <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the floor and <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the <b>rack</b> were all taken wall by dairy cows, indicating no significant difference of the amount taken.

50|$|Laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> can be mainly {{categorized}} {{into three}} major types including stainless steel laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>racks,</b> epoxy laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>racks,</b> and acrylic laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>drying</b> <b>racks,</b> {{including}} large, stationary outdoor racks, smaller, folding portable <b>racks,</b> and wall-mounted <b>drying</b> <b>racks.</b> A <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> is similar in usage and function to a clothes line, and used {{as an alternative to}} the powered clothes dryer.|$|R
5000|$|Stainless steel {{laboratory}} <b>drying</b> <b>rack,</b> {{which is}} also known as a 'Mod-Rack' pegboard, is the <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> made of stainless steel that uses to drain laboratory accessories. The examples of stainless steel laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> are flask holders, soap dispensers, paper towel dispensers, glove box holders, drain shelves. [...] Stainless steel pegboard installation is very easy and quick to set up with basic hand equipment's, and it does not damage the wall as mounting brackets and hardware are being used.|$|R
50|$|Epoxy {{laboratory}} <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> are {{the most}} common type of <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> that are used among university labs and science classrooms in many high schools. Epoxy <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> are mounted directly to a wall or other solid structures which can be set up with basic hand tools and power tools. They are easily installed by using wall anchors and other strong fasteners due to their small weight. Typical installation is to drill holes, one at each corner, and to use the mounting points in order to fix it to the wall.|$|R
50|$|A hayrack (kozolec) is a {{freestanding}} vertical <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> found chiefly in Slovenia. Hayracks are permanent structures, primarily made of wood, {{upon which}} fodder for animals is dried, although their use {{is not limited}} to <b>drying</b> <b>hay.</b> Other food stuffs such as field maize are dried on them as well. Although it is a practical structure, a hayrack is often artistically designed and handcrafted and is regarded by Slovenes as a distinctive form of vernacular architecture that marks Slovene identity.|$|R
50|$|Laboratory <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> is a {{pegboard}} {{for hanging}} and draining glassware in a laboratory. It {{is available in}} different varieties and sizes.

In addition to that, the pegs on the <b>drying</b> <b>rack</b> are easily removable and replaceable {{in order to maintain the}} cleaning of the lab racks to avoid contamination with other apparatus used on the same rack. Any common laboratory needs to have at least two or three <b>drying</b> <b>racks</b> per lab.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> three different farm sizes were compared, for bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> only one farm size is calculated. Bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> demands more power and investment cost as box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> of loose <b>hay.</b> Bale <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R
