5|$|The armies met on 21 June in Lochaber and Alexander, {{suffering}} the defection of Clan Chattan (the MacKintoshes) and Clan Cameron, was heavily defeated. Alexander escaped probably to Islay but James continued his {{assault on the}} Lordship by taking the strongholds of Dingwall and Urquhart castles in July. The king pushed home his advantage when an army reinforced with artillery was dispatched to the isles. Alexander probably realised that his position was hopeless and tried to negotiate terms of surrender but James demanded and received his total submission. From August 1429 the king delegated royal authority to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar for the keeping of the peace {{in the north and}} west. The Islesmen rose again in September 1431 and inflicted two important defeats on the king's men – Mar's army was beaten at Inverlochy and Angus Moray's in a fierce battle near Tongue in Caithness. This was a serious setback for James and his credibility was adversely affected. In 1431, before the September uprising, the king had arrested two of his nephews, John Kennedy of Carrick and Archibald, Earl of Douglas possibly {{as a result of a}} conflict between John and his uncle, Thomas Kennedy in which Douglas may have become involved. Douglas's arrest had raised tensions in the country and James acted to reduce the unrest by freeing the earl on 29 September – it was quite likely that the king made the earl's release conditional on support at the forthcoming parliament at Perth at which James intended to push for further funding for the campaign against the Lordship. Parliament <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to allow James unconditional backing – he was allowed a tax to fund his Highland campaign but parliament retained full control over the levy. The rules parliament attached to the taxation indicated a robust stand against further conflict in the north and probably led to the turnaround that took place on 22 October when the king 'forgave the offence of each earl, namely Douglas and Ross '. For Douglas this was a formal acknowledgement of his having already been freed three weeks earlier but for Alexander this was a total reversal of crown policy towards the Lordship. Four summer campaigns against the Lordship were now officially at an end with James's wishes having effectively been blocked by parliament.|$|E

25|$|The {{pay-per-view}} event {{featured the}} buildup of a rivalry among two tag teams, a group {{of at least two}} wrestlers. The two groups were Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan versus Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. The night after WrestleMania, Michaels thanked the fans for their support towards him, despite Michaels losing at the event. Michaels continued, but was interrupted by Hassan and Daivari. Michaels, however, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to listen to Hassan's comments regarding Michaels loss. As a result, Michaels slapped Hassan, which led to Hassan and Daivari to attack Michaels, leaving him unconscious in the ring. The following week, Michaels approached authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, in which he demanded a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari, a match consisting of one wrestler or team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as two against one, or three against two. Bischoff refused to schedule the match, but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant him the match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan to come back and team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer.|$|E

25|$|Owain {{also scored}} {{his first major}} victory {{in the field in}} May or June, at Mynydd Hyddgen near Pumlumon. Owain and his army of a few hundred were camped {{at the bottom of the}} Hyddgen Valley when about fifteen hundred English and Flemish {{settlers}} from Pembrokeshire ('little England beyond Wales'), charged down on them. Owain rallied his army and fought back, killing 200. The situation was sufficiently serious for the King to assemble another punitive expedition. This time he attacked in October through central Wales. From Shrewsbury and Hereford Castle, Henry IV's forces drove through Powys toward the Strata Florida Abbey. The Cistercian house was known to be sympathetic towards Owain and Henry intended to remind them of their loyalties and prevent the revolt from spreading any further south. After much harassment by Owain's forces he reached Strata Florida. Henry <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to be merciful. His army partially destroyed the abbey and executed a monk suspected of bearing arms against him. However, he failed to engage Owain's forces in any large numbers. Owain's forces harassed him and engaged in hit-and-run tactics on his supply chain but refused to fight in the open. Henry's army was forced to retreat. They arrived at Worcester on 28 October 1401 with little to claim for their efforts. The year came to end with the Battle of Tuthill, an inconclusive battle fought during Owain's siege of Caernarfon Castle on 2 November 1401.|$|E
2500|$|But Hanoi <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to negotiate. On 28 April PAVN forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the city. At the Newport Bridge (...) , about three miles (five kilometers) from the city center, South Vietnamese soldiers battled with PAVN troops attempting to control the span, cutting the city's last overland connection to the south and thereby gaining immediate access to downtown. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, a formation of four A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tan Son Nhut airport. As Bien Hoa was falling, General Toan fled to Saigon, informing the government that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Having won the {{previous}} two encounters {{between himself and the}} Brit, Federer needed to win this match in order to finally gain his head to head advantage over Murray {{for the first time since}} 2005. Murray also needed to win this match in straight sets in order to be able to progress to the semi-final stage of the tournament. [...] However the Brit was in for a hard time as Federer <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to give Murray any chance of winning. [...] Murray was two points away from a double bagel but managed to hold serve. Federer won the next game and handed Murray his worst loss since losing to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals at the 2007 Sony Ericsson Open. [...] With this win, Federer became the first man to score a 6–0 set on all of his big four rivals.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Marvin Gaye {{had fallen}} into a deep {{depression}} following the brain tumor diagnosis of his Motown singing partner Tammi Terrell, the failure of his marriage to Anna Gordy, a growing dependency on cocaine, troubles with the IRS, and struggles with Motown Records, the label he had signed with in 1961. At one point, Gaye attempted suicide at a Detroit apartment with a handgun, only to be saved from committing the act by Berry Gordy's father. During this time, Gaye began experiencing international success {{for the first time in}} his career following the release of [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and subsequent hit singles such as [...] "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby", [...] "Abraham, Martin & John" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". But Gaye <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>mood</b> to celebrate: [...] "My success didn't seem real. I didn't deserve it. I knew I could have done more.
