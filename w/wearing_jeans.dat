25|$|In 1950 Proudfoot {{became the}} {{youngest}} member of Scarborough Borough Council when he was elected as a councillor for the Conservative Party. He soon became a prominent local politician although his informal personal style did not always endear him to some people. He was once asked to leave the Scarborough Conservative Club when he entered it <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> and a cardigan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the White House, Kennedy's style {{underwent}} a change, with her new looks consisting of wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk Hermès head scarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> in public. Beltless, white jeans with a black turtleneck, never tucked in, but pulled down over the hips, was another fashion trend that she set.|$|E

25|$|Chiggers {{attach to}} the host, pierce the skin, inject enzymes into the bite wound that digest {{cellular}} contents, and then suck up the digested tissue through a tube formed by hardened skin cells called a stylostome. They do not burrow into the skin or suck blood, as is commonly assumed. Itching from a chigger bite may not develop until 24–48 hours after the bite, so the victim may not associate the specific exposure with the bite itself. The red welt/bump on the skin is not where a chigger laid eggs, as is sometimes believed. The larva remains attached to a suitable host for {{three to five days}} before dropping off to begin its nymphal stage. They tend to attach where clothing have restrictions, such as belt lines, or behind the knees when <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans.</b>|$|E
25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk got even dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or maybe because of it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> or even underpants on the picture. After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{everyone}} who came wore bright or unusual costumes: tribal robes, Mexican ponchos, Indian kurtas, [...] "God's-eyes," [...] feathers, and beads. Some hippies brought their own flutes, lutes, gourds, drums, rattles, horns, and guitars. The Hell's Angels, dirty-haired, <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans,</b> boots, and denim jackets {{and accompanied by}} their women, made their entrance, carrying chains, smoking cigarettes, and displaying their regalia of German helmets, emblazoned emblems, and so on– everything but their motorcycles, which they had parked outside.|$|E
50|$|During his {{political}} career, Kitzhaber became famous for <b>wearing</b> blue <b>jeans</b> during speaking engagements. When he <b>wore</b> <b>jeans</b> to his inauguration in 1995, {{he created a}} minor stir. During his 2010 campaign for a third term as governor, Kitzhaber frequently avoided the necktie as well, preferring a button-down shirt and suit jacket with no tie.|$|R
5000|$|A {{couple of}} {{examples}} of the loose rhetorical use would be to say: because Ted's <b>wearing</b> of <b>jeans</b> to work is considered exceptional, it proves {{the rule of thumb}} that most employees do not tend to <b>wear</b> <b>jeans</b> in that setting. The original sense of the phrase could only apply to this situation if it were somehow altered, for example: if all employees were informed, upon being hired, that [...] "Ted is allowed to wear jeans" [...] because of his relationship with the company's founders. In this way it is implied that none of the rest of them may be allowed (as a universal rule to which Ted is the stated exception) to <b>wear</b> <b>jeans</b> in the workplace.|$|R

500|$|Between 8:00 to 8:30 pm, a {{contractor}} {{returning home from}} Franconia saw a young person moving quickly on foot eastbound on Route 112 about [...] east of where Murray's vehicle was discovered. He noted that the young person was <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans,</b> a dark coat, and a light-colored hood. He didn't report it to police immediately due to his own confusion of dates, only discovering three months later (when reviewing his work records) that he'd spotted the young person the same night Murray disappeared.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, 30 May 1984, Buendía {{left his}} offices in Colonia Juárez at around 6:30p.m. and headed towards {{his car in}} a parking lot near Insurgentes Avenue at the Zona Rosa {{neighborhood}} in Mexico City. As he got closer to his car, a tall man <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans,</b> a black jacket, and a baseball cap approached him from behind and violently grabbed his coat before shooting him four times with a [...]38 Super. Buendía was carrying a handgun on his waist but {{he was not able to}} defend himself at the moment of his death. After killing him, the assailant fled on a motorcycle with another man.|$|E

Some of the more {{conservative}} establishments and universities follow strict dress codes, such as the National Textile University in Faisalabad where a notice was issued on 27 April 2016 by university professor Muhammad Ashfaq. The intent of the notice was to [...] "promote a positive image of the NTU and to maintain good moral, religious and cultural values among the faculty, staff and students." [...] The dress code bans certain styles of Western attire including shorts, sleeveless shirts and shawls for men.

500|$|In 1941 Anderson {{completed}} her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on [...] "Low energy {{levels in the}} atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. [...] Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. [...] Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, {{she lived in a}} dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> and a plaid shirt– not the usual attire for a woman at the time.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} episode of The Chaser's War on Everything, the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt {{to disguise the}} vehicles {{was the use of}} a Canadian flag. Taylor later said that there was [...] "no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade—as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with JOKE, Insecurity, and It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass all clearly visible, while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him. In addition, some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans,</b> both highly unusual for an official motorcade.|$|E

500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm proud of you, Darvin." [...] Some were critical of both Moon and Cada. Mike Matusow, a professional poker player {{with a reputation}} for trash-talking, called the heads-up contest between the two [...] "a new low for poker as a skilled game". Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center. Moon said of his victory, [...] "We ain't gonna change. The next time you see us, we'll be <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> and everything else, like we always have." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs. He called them in {{separately}} for half-hour interviews {{and told them}} that he had not seen any of their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|Susie Bright {{described}} {{some of the}} specifically lesbian {{themes of}} the film. One {{is the concept of}} the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands. Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic motif to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink. Bright describes it as a movie that is [...] "wet" [...] (feminine) as opposed to [...] "hard" [...] (masculine). She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of [...] "lesbian signs". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and [...] "girly"—making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that [...] "everyone in the film wants to be with Violet". When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the LGBT film festival screenings.|$|E
5000|$|The flaite {{stereotype}} wear sneakers such as Nike Dunks {{and other}} basketball or soccer shoes. They usually have short haircuts (called [...] "sopaipilla", {{because it looks}} like that fried pastry) accompanied by jockey caps. They enjoy wearing flashy accessories, known as bling-bling, as well as tightly <b>worn</b> <b>jeans.</b> Some youth from middle to upper socioeconomic backgrounds follow the fashion style of the flaites but <b>wearing</b> baggy <b>jeans,</b> which is believed {{by some to be}} evolving into a subcultural group.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, in an infamous {{case that}} gained {{international}} attention, the Court of Cassation of Italy declared a man {{not guilty of}} the rape {{of a woman who}} was <b>wearing</b> tight <b>jeans,</b> claiming {{that it was impossible to}} forcibly remove tight jeans [...] "without the collaboration of the person wearing them" [...] if she resists. The court also equated the removal of the jeans with consent to sexual penetration. Following this ruling, there was outrage, both in Italy and abroad. In Italy, female politicians <b>wore</b> <b>jeans</b> to parliament in protest. It was only in 2008, in a new case, that the Court of Cassation overturned this ruling, admitting that women who <b>wear</b> tight <b>jeans</b> can indeed be raped.|$|R

500|$|Clay and Webster were at {{the head}} of perhaps 5,000 Whig {{speakers}} who criss-crossed the nation in Harrison's cause. Clay was unenthusiastic about the idea of being a stump speaker, but warmed to it as he sought to boost himself to be Whig presidential candidate in 1844 (Harrison had promised to serve only one term), and spoke widely, especially in the South, though he mentioned Harrison infrequently. Another prominent speaker was a Whig state assemblyman from Illinois and candidate for presidential elector from that state, Abraham Lincoln, who spoke to a crowd of 15,000 in Springfield, Illinois, <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans.</b> The aristocratic South Carolina former congressman, Hugh Legare also spoke widely, and took to wearing a coonskin cap on the campaign trail, drinking hard cider as he partied with the [...] "Log Cabin Boys". John Bear, the [...] "Buckeye Blacksmith", from South Bloomfield, Ohio was a prominent Whig speaker. After making a hit in his first speech outside his home town at the February Columbus rally, the Whigs sent him on the road as a person who could appeal to the tradesmen and farmers who made up much of the electorate. He also got to associate with the elite, meeting Harrison at North Bend and attending a party at the Washington home of former president John Quincy Adams. Bear made 331 speeches, the most of any Whig surrogate, and inspired other craftsmen like Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, the [...] "Natick Cobbler", who would rise to the vice presidency under Grant.|$|E

2500|$|In Rome in 1992, a 45-year-old driving {{instructor}} {{was accused of}} rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told {{her that if she}} was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex"). [...] The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.” This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> and holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. <b>Wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> on this day has become an international symbol of protest. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and {{there is no longer a}} [...] "denim" [...] defense to the charge of rape.|$|E
