The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> length of 335.2 picometers; the beta form is rhombohedral.

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a crown graph on 2n {{vertices}} is an undirected graph with two sets of vertices u'i and v'i and <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> from u'i to v'j whenever i≠j. The crown graph {{can be viewed as}} a complete bipartite graph from which the edges of a perfect matching have been removed, as the bipartite double cover of a complete graph, as the tensor product K'n × K'2, as the complement of the Cartesian direct product of K'n and K'2, or as a bipartite Kneser graph H'n,1 representing the 1-item and (n1)-item subsets of an n-item set, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between two subsets whenever one is contained in the other.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{construction}} can {{be based}} on Skolem's paradox, {{the fact that there}} exists a countable model for the first-order theory of sets.

25|$|The {{rigidity}} matroids {{describe the}} {{degrees of freedom}} of mechanical linkages formed by rigid bars connected at their ends by flexible hinges. A linkage of this type may {{be described as a}} graph, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> for each bar and a vertex for each hinge, and for one-dimensional linkages the rigidity matroids are exactly the graphic matroids.

25|$|An edge {{violation}} {{occurs when}} a skater executes a jump on the incorrect edge. The hollow is a groove {{on the bottom of}} the blade which creates two distinct edges, inside and outside. The inside edge of the blade is on the side closest to the skater, the outside edge is on the side farthest from the skater, and a flat refers to skating on both edges at the same time, which is discouraged. An unclear edge or edge violation is indicated with an 'e' and reflected in the GOE according to the severity of the problem. Flutz and lip are the colloquial terms for a Lutz and flip jump <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> violation.|$|E
25|$|It {{may be that}} {{a player}} has an {{infinite}} number of possible actions to choose from at a particular decision node. The device used to represent this is an arc joining two edges protruding from the decision node in question. If the action space is a continuum between two numbers, the lower and upper delimiting numbers are placed at the bottom and top of the arc respectively, usually with a variable that is used to express the payoffs. The infinite number of decision nodes that could result are represented by a single node placed in the centre of the arc. A similar device is used to represent action spaces that, whilst not infinite, are large enough to prove impractical to represent <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> for each action.|$|E

500|$|After {{the initial}} {{segment of the}} single Green Line opened, [...] Metrorail saw less than 10,000 riders per day. This {{increased}} to 15,000 after {{the rest of the}} line and stations opened in late 1984 and 1985. After running out of money due to cost overruns, the originally planned to be [...] system consisting of several lines was never completed, and lack of transit-oriented development along the single line led to the system being regarded as a boondoggle. President Ronald Reagan commented that, given the low number of riders, it would have been cheaper to buy them all a limousine than the billion dollar cost of building and subsidizing the system. The federal subsidy was approximately $800 million of the $1.02 billion used to fund the line. Ridership was up to 15,000 after the rest of the line had opened. Ridership continued to grow in the late 1980s, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> city-like area known as Dadeland in suburban Kendall growing up around the southern terminus of the line at Dadeland North and Dadeland South stations. Consequently, the southern nine stations from Kendall to Downtown Miami have higher ridership than the northern end. This part of the system also has a higher average speed, having fewer curves and long distances between stations as it follows the congested South Dixie Highway. During the 1990s, ridership growth was relatively stagnant, however, and Metrorail remained the subject of criticism. At this time, ridership was up to about 50,000 per day, {{about a quarter of the}} original ridership estimate.|$|E
500|$|The edges {{within a}} single page of a book {{embedding}} behave in some ways like a stack data structure. This can be formalized by considering an arbitrary sequence of push and pop operations on a stack, and forming a graph in which the stack operations correspond to the vertices of the graph, placed in sequence order along the spine of a book embedding. Then, if one draws an edge from each pop operation that pops an object [...] from the stack, to the previous push operation that pushed , the resulting graph will automatically have a one-page embedding. For this reason, the page number of a graph has also been called its stack number. In the same way, one may consider an arbitrary sequence of enqueue and dequeue operations of a queue data structure, and form a graph that has these operations as its vertices, placed in order on the spine of a single page, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> between each enqueue operation and the corresponding dequeue. Then, in this graph, each two edges will either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine. By analogy, researchers have defined a queue embedding of a graph to be an embedding in a topological book such that each vertex lies on the spine, each edge lies in a single page, and each two edges in the same page either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine. The minimum number of pages needed for a queue embedding of a graph is called its queue number.|$|E
