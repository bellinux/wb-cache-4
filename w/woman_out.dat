5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the <b>woman,</b> <b>out</b> of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
25|$|Maclagan {{opened the}} batting for England, and made 72 {{before she was}} the fifth <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> with England on 116, just before close on the first day. On day two, England moved on to 154, with Betty Archdale making 32 not out. In their second innings, Australia fared better, and were 99 for 5 at close on the second day. Maclagan failed to take a wicket in her 28 overs, but it was Mary Spear's five wickets that did the damage, as the home team were all of for 138, a total which {{included}} 63 runs scored over {{more than four hours}} from Essie Shevill. England were thus set just 32 for the win, which they secured with the loss of just one wicket.|$|E

25|$|After some time, Artemis {{returned}} to Themyscira to aid her Amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions {{they continued to}} work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes. Civil war eventually broke out {{between the two groups}} of Amazons, leaving Artemis to take up the title of her tribe's chief warrior, or Shim'Tar. She did this in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations. As Shim'Tar, Artemis battled Queen Hippolyta, who was acting as the newest Wonder Woman. During their battle, Artemis reminded Hippolyta that the Themyscirian queen was not given the armor of Wonder <b>Woman</b> <b>out</b> of honor, but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only Artemis, but of her daughter Diana as well. Ultimately coming to her senses, Hippolyta finally forgave the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall for their previous transgressions, and joined her daughter Diana on the battlefield. Together Queen Hippolyta and Princess Diana renounced their crowns, leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war. They were successful, and Artemis and the Themyscirian General Philippus were later voted to be co-rulers of the island. Philippus was given the title of Chancellor and Archon Eponymous, whereas Artemis was given the title of Polemarch. It is explained that Archon Eponymous equates to the Civic Office of a Presidential title, whereas the position of Polemarch translates to War Leader, similar to the position of Commander-In-Chief.|$|E
500|$|According to John Coplans's Roy Lichtenstein, {{the artist}} {{was fascinated by the}} drawings: [...] "isolating the <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> of the context of the {{painting}} seemed to Lichtenstein to be such an oversimplification of a complex issue as to be ironical in itself"; the oversimplification referred to was Loran's representing Cézanne's work with nothing more than black lines. The work marked the first of Lichtenstein's [...] "artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism" [...] that resulted from his realization of the interrelation [...] "between avant-garde and kitsch".|$|E

[...] Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour's ideal reader was the same woman Savvy had tried to reach.

500|$|Comics scholar Jeet Heer called Rarebit Fiend [...] "perhaps {{the most}} bizarre {{newspaper}} feature in American history". [...] Merkl notes examples of the strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> a window, as in Luis Buñuel's film L'Age d'Or (1930); and giant characters let loose in the big city, climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in King Kong (1933). [...] Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child's bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 Ray Bradbury story [...] "The Veldt", and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a stretchable face, to Salvador Dalí's surrealist painting Soft self-portrait with fried bacon (1941) and the cosmetic surgeries in Terry Gilliam's Brazil. [...] Stephen R. Bissette compares a strip featuring elevators flying from buildings and other scenes to the 2005 Tim Burton take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.|$|E
500|$|O'Malley {{moves in}} with new intern Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister. Lexie and O'Malley {{discover}} {{that he only}} failed his exam by a single point, leading him to confront Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the chief of surgery, {{to ask for a}} chance to retake the exam. He passes the second attempt, and begins to distance himself from Lexie, who has fallen in love with him. O'Malley supports Stevens when she discovers she has melanoma, and walks her down the aisle as she marries Karev. O'Malley begins to display a talent for trauma surgery, and is told by the chief of trauma surgery Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) that it is definitely his specialty. He then abruptly and inexplicably decides to join the U.S. Army. While his friends at the hospital prepare an intervention to convince O'Malley to stay, they all work on a severely disfigured John Doe, brought in after a horrible bus accident, in which he pushed a <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> of the way and saved her life. When Meredith goes to check on John Doe, he seems to recognize her and will not let go of her hand. After several attempts at trying, he succeeds in tracing [...] "007" [...] on Meredith's hand. Shocked, she realizes [...] "John Doe" [...] is in fact O'Malley. She informs the other surgeons and they rush him to surgery. However, he flatlines and is ultimately declared braindead. His organs are donated after Stevens confirms that is what O'Malley would have wanted, and he is buried a week later.|$|E

2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a key {{into the world of}} one of the last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "We’ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that we’ll know, for certain, that she won’t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was the kind of woman who was accused of being more style than substance– and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E
