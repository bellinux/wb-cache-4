5|$|Due to {{a change}} in {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral election will take office January 1, 2018.|$|E

5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago.

5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E

5|$|The {{grasshopper}} nematode (Mermis nigrescens) {{is a long}} slender worm that infects grasshoppers, {{living in}} the insect's hemocoel. Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten. Spinochordodes tellinii and Paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts. When the worms are sufficiently developed, the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns, thus enabling the parasite to continue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> stage of its life cycle, which takes place in water.|$|E
5|$|The northeastern Pacific {{hurricane}} basins {{are divided}} into two parts– eastern and central. The eastern Pacific basin extends from {{all areas of the}} Pacific north of the equator east of 140°W, while the central Pacific basin includes areas north of the equator between 140°W and 180°W. Both basins extend to the Arctic Circle at 66°N. When tropical cyclones cross from the Atlantic into the Pacific, the name of the previous storm is retained if the system continues to exhibit tropical characteristics; however, when hurricanes degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area, the system is designated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> name on the rotating eastern Pacific hurricane naming list.|$|E

5|$|Alanya {{was set up}} as a {{municipality}} in 1872, electing {{its first}} mayor in 1901. Today, Alanya is governed by a mayor and a municipality council made up of thirty-seven members. Eighteen councilors are from the far-right Nationalist Movement Party, seven are from the center-left Republican People's Party, and twelve are of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which is currently in power in the national government. Mayor Adem Murat Yücel of the Nationalist Movement Party was elected in 2014 by unseating the incumbent Hasan Sipahioğlu, who had previously been mayor since 1999. Elections are held every five years, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{to be held in}} March 2019. Alanya also has a deputy mayor, who often represents the city at its sporting events, and together the mayor and his team represent Alanya in the provincial assembly in Antalya.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs returned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E
5|$|Bonnet further {{tried to}} {{disguise}} {{his return to}} piracy by engaging in a pretence of trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two vessels he robbed. Soon afterward, Bonnet quit the charade of trading and reverted to naked piracy. In July 1718, he cruised north to Delaware Bay, pillaging another eleven vessels. He took several prisoners, some of whom joined his pirate crew. While Bonnet set loose most of his prizes after looting them, he retained control {{of the last two}} ships he captured: the sloops Francis and Fortune. On 1August 1718, the Royal James and the two captured sloops sailed southward from Delaware Bay. The captured sloops lagged behind, and Bonnet threatened to sink them if they did not stay closer. During the passage, Bonnet and his crew divided their loot into shares of about £10 or £11 and distributed them amongst themselves. This is the only time Bonnet is known to have practised this important pirate custom, and it suggests he had by then abandoned his unorthodox practice of paying regular wages to his crew.|$|E
