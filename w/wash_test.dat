[...] Mak initially {{went to his}} lab {{to inquire}} about a job posting from Rueckert's lab {{looking for someone to}} <b>wash</b> <b>test</b> tubes. After his first day on the job, Mak asked if more cleaning work was available, in which Rueckert said there was not, however there was experimental research work available. That, as Mak would later state, would be the beginning of his scientific career. [...] After finishing his degree at Wisconsin, Mak moved to Canada to begin his doctoral studies at the University of Alberta, Edmonton. In the early 1970s, he earned his PhD in biochemistry from the University of Alberta. After he obtained his degree, Mak moved to Toronto and became a Canadian citizen. In Toronto, he worked with Ernest McCulloch and James Till, who discovered haematopoietic stem cells.|$|E

40|$|Various {{clinical}} procedures {{exist for}} determining the mildness of personal washing products. It is common to use several of these evaluation methods {{in the development of}} a safety-and-claim support package. The utility of many of the methods is limited by their susceptibility to fluctuations in weather conditions. In this paper we describe amethod, the flex <b>wash</b> <b>test,</b> which is not affected by changes in weather and can be used as a highly reproducible method {{for determining the}} relative irritancy potential of personal washing products. The flex <b>wash</b> <b>test</b> consists of a sixty-second wash, three times daily, of the antecubital fossa (flex area) of the arm. Washing is conducted for five consecutive days or until a moderate rythemic response is elicited. Erythema is assessed prior to each wash and four hours after the last daily wash. Twelve commer-cially available personal washing bars were evaluated in this study. The flex wash is a reproducible clinical test that distinguishes differences in the relative irritancy potential of various syndet (synthetic detergent) and soap bars and is independent of ambient weather conditions...|$|E

The constituent materials and fabric structures have been specifically selected and tailored for firefighters’ clothing. In order to do this, four types of outer shell fabrics, four types of moisture barrier fabrics, and four types of heat barriers with different weights and material compositions were {{used to make a}} multilayered fabric assembly. Heat transfer (flame), heat transfer (radiant), and water vapour resistance tests were conducted according to the latest EN 469 test standard which also recommends <b>washing</b> <b>tests.</b> These tests reveal that material content and material brand have considerable effect on the required performance levels of heat protection.

40|$|Various {{methods are}} {{available}} for evaluation (for diagnosis and/or quantification) of a patient presenting with hair loss. Hair evaluation methods are grouped into three main categories: Non-invasive methods (e. g., questionnaire, daily hair counts, standardized <b>wash</b> <b>test,</b> 60 -s hair count, global photographs, dermoscopy, hair weight, contrasting felt examination, phototrichogram, TrichoScan and polarizing and surface electron microscopy), semi-invasive methods (e. g., trichogram and unit area trichogram) and invasive methods (e. g., scalp biopsy). Any single method is neither 'ideal' nor feasible. However, when interpreted with caution, these are valuable tools for patient diagnosis and monitoring. Daily hair counts, <b>wash</b> <b>test,</b> etc. are good methods for primary evaluation of the patient and to get an approximate assessment {{of the amount of}} shedding. Some methods like global photography form an important part of any hair clinic. Analytical methods like phototrichogram are usually possible only in the setting of a clinical trial. Many of these methods (like the scalp biopsy) require expertise for both processing and interpreting. We reviewed the available literature in detail in light of merits and demerits of each method. A plethora of newer methods is being introduced, which are relevant to the cosmetic industry/research. Such methods as well as metabolic/hormonal evaluation are not included in this review...|$|E

The enzyme was found to be stable over a pH ranging from 7 - 12 with maximum activity at pH- 11. 0. The protease retained more than 60 % activity after 90 min of exposure to all the selected temperatures of 20, 40, 60 and 80 C.

40|$|The {{leaching}} of lignin {{from the}} fibre wall was studied {{in order to}} investigate the effects in the clean end of the fibre line. The focus was set on the short time intervals representative for the washing operation in industrial applications. The influence of temperature, pulp type and kappa number was investigated. It could be seen that there are different diffusivities for the soluble lignin in the wall at short and long time of leaching, {{probably due to the}} existence of a more open structure in an outer layer of the fibre wall, in which the lignin diffuses more easily and which is also emptied relatively fast, while diffusion of the lignin from the inner layers is significantly slower. There is also a relation between the leaching of sodium out of the wall and the short term diffusion time of lignin, indicating a possible ion-ion interaction with the lignin in the outer layer of the fibre wall. The diffusivity of lignin increases more rapidly at temperatures above 80 - 90 °C.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} ozone in food processing {{lies in the}} fact that ozone is a 52 % stronger oxidant than chlorine. The widespread use of chlorine by the US food industry is under scrutiny and the acceptance of chlorine as the primary sanitizing agent for food process operations is being reconsidered by many processors and regulators. By US law, ozone is classified as a food additive thus its use in or on food is regulated. This classification disallows for ozone's use as a direct contact food sanitizing agent. However, quite recently the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been petitioned for the acceptance of ozone as a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) substance. Prior to the regulatory acceptance of ozone as a direct contact food sanitizer, water containing an ozone residual can not be applied to food. This is not to imply that ozone has no other useful agricultural applications. Numerous agricultural applications exist aside from the use of ozone as a sanitizing agent for commodities or produce. The focus of this work is to determine the efficacy of ozone as a chlorine replacement in the sanitation of whole, fresh fruits and vegetables.

40|$|Existing ITP {{filtrate}} hold tanks {{may provide}} sufficient capacity and residence time to strip dissolved benzene from the incoming filtrate using nitrogen sparging {{in the bottom}} of the old tanks. This is based on equilibrium supported by late <b>Wash</b> <b>test</b> data using aged washed slurry. Theoretical considerations indicate that benzene stripping will be more difficult from the ITP unwashed high salt filtrates due to reduced mass transfer. Therefore experimental sparging data is needed to quantify the theoretical effects. Foaming limits which dictate allowable sparging rate will also have to be established. Sparging in the hold tanks will require installation of sintered metal spargers, and possibly stirrers and foam monitoring/disengagement equipment. The most critical sparging needs are at the start of the precipitation/concentration cycle, when the filtrate flux rate is the highest,and at the end of wash cycle where Henry`s equilibrium constant falls off,requiring more gas to sparge the dissolved benzene. With adequate recycle (for proper distribution) or sparging in the old tanks, the 30 inch column could be used for the complete ITP process. A courser packing would reduce back pressure while enabling benzene stripping. The Late Wash Tests indicate adequate benzene stripping even at reduced gas flow. This will require experimental verification under ITP conditions. Using the 30 in. column vs 18 in. during the wash cycle will enhance stripping without need for additional sparging provided the minimum flow requirements are met...|$|E

40|$|Discrepancies {{between the}} {{one-time}} patch {{test and the}} <b>wash</b> <b>test</b> regarding the ranking of irritancy of detergents {{have been found in}} the literature. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the concordance of irritancy rank order of 4 anionic detergents tested by 3 different exposure methods, namely one-time occlusive. repeated short-time occlusive and repeated short-time open tests. These detergents were sodium cocoyl isethionate (ISE), sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), soap and disodium lauryl 3 -ethoxysulfosuccinate (SUC). The reactions were evaluated by visual scoring and by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement. When scored visually, the rank order in the one-time test was: SOAP greater than or equal to SLS greater than or equal to ISE >SUC. The other test methods yielded a different order: SLS >ISE greater than or equal to SOAP >SUC. A similar rank order was obtained with TEWL measurement for all exposure methods. Generally, the concordance among the different exposure methods was high when evaluated by TEWL. The concordance was lower when evaluation was performed by visual scoring. The present study demonstrates that the choice of exposure model and evaluation method may be important variables influencing the outcome of irritancy testing. It is proposed that the repeated open test is the best way to simulate most in-use situations when the uncovered skin is exposed to detergents. The repeated occlusive test or the one-time patch test may be better to simulate situations in which the skin is occluded after irritation by detergents...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: The {{increasing}} demand for endoscopic procedures poses new contamination challenges, given developing antimicrobial resistance worldwide and potential viral or prion diseases in populations at risk. We examined working channels from reusable luminal endoscopes used in recent years. Methods: Very sensitive fluorescence epimicroscopy {{was used to}} examine working channels from 6 decommissioned and 6 factory-new channels, as received, or following spiking and washing in the laboratory. Results: After a single contamination and <b>wash</b> <b>test</b> cycle, new channels retained approximately 75 ?pg/mm 2 of proteins; through 7 subsequent cycles residual proteins fluctuated between 25 and 75 ?pg/mm 2. Decommissioned channels harbored 1 ?–? 4 ?µg of proteins each, except in one gastroscope (33 ?µg), including up to 2 ?% amyloid proteins except in one gastroscope and one sigmoidoscope (with over 80 ?%); lumens showed wearing with established abraded biofilms in 3 cases. After spiking with scrapie-infected blood components and washing, residual protein levels in new channels varied following standard (17. 23 ?pg/mm 2), duplicated (2. 39 ?pg/mm 2) or extended (11. 3 ?pg/mm 2) washing; no changes were measured among the long-established contamination in old channels. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that wear effects in endoscope lumens may contribute to the adsorption of proteins, thus facilitating retention and survival of bacteria. As demonstrated by recent outbreaks worldwide despite recommended reprocessing, the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains, and the estimated prevalence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK particularly, combined with increasing demand for endoscopic procedures, call for sustained precautions and improved methods for the reprocessing of nonautoclavable, reusable surgical instruments...|$|E

By combining the dynamic performance of conductive inks, and the functionality of ultra-thinned, traditional IC technology, new FHE devices allow for development of applications previously excluded by relying on a specific type of electronics technology. The characterization and reliability analysis of stretchable conductive inks paired with ultra-thin silicon die in theµm range was conducted. A silver based ink designed to be stretchable was screen printed on a TPU substrate and cured using box oven, conveyor convection oven, and photonic curing processes. Reliability tests were conducted including a tape test, crease test, <b>wash</b> <b>test,</b> and abrasion test. Optimization of each curing process resulted in all three methods’ ability to achieve the ink sheet resistance specification of 3 ̆c 75 mΩ/square/ 25 µm.

Additionally, a series of 10 mm x 10 mm ultra-thin die were characterized using stylus profilometry and optical measurement in order to test the die quality and readiness for assembly. The die had been thinned from an initial thickness down of 600 µm to a target of 50 µm. A direct inverse relationship was shown between die thickness and die warpage, likely due to high levels of internal stress caused by the dicing and thinning process.

The first version of active electrode involved direct attachment of surface-mountable components to a textile screen-printed circuit using polymer thick film techniques. The second ver-sion involved attaching a much smaller, thinner, and less obtrusive interposer containing the active electrode circuitry to a simplified textile circuit. These designs explored techniques for electronic tex-tile interconnection, chip attachment to textiles, and packaging of circuits on textiles for durability. The results from ECG tests indi-cate that the performance of each active electrode is comparable to commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes.

Ayurweda described about “Kshudra Kushta” which has similar symptoms to those of CD. Herbs such aswild snakegourd, white sandalwood, red sandal wood and Heart leaved Moonseed are used in Ayurveda to cure “Kshudra kushta”. Mixtures of herbs with fixing agents were applied to cotton and polyester fabrications through a natural dyeing method to find a fabric finishing method for CD.

40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide epichlorhydrin resin) covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the untreated wool fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 <b>wash</b> <b>test</b> procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on untreated wool. The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the reductive bleached wool is greater than on the oxidative bleached wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction of urea to isocyanic acid and the subsequent reaction of isocyanic acid with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes. The reaction of wool nucleophiles with isocyanic acid derived from sodium cyanate was studied. The properties of the modified wool were investigated. A novel method of colormetric labelling of the tyrosine residues was developed to follow the extent of modification oftyrosine in wool using isocyanic acid.

40|$|Nano-Ag-loaded SiO 2 {{antibacterial}} agent (Ag/SiO 2) was prepared by a chemical reduction method {{and served as}} a modifier to endow silk fabric with antibacterial activity. Impregnated antibacterial silk (I-silk) and grafted antibacterial silk (G-silk) were obtained by dipping method and grafting with coupling agent KH 550, respectively. The morphologies and valence-bond structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The washing fastness and antibacterial performance of G-silk were detected by the <b>washing</b> <b>test</b> and oscillation flask method. The results show that the chemical structure of G-silk changed in comparison with that of natural silk. The antibacterial rates of G-silk against E. coli and S. aureus were 96. 5 % and 92. 8 %, respectively. And it was still over 80 % even after being washed for 30 times, suggesting good wash fastness and long-acting antibacterial activity...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} improve the {{durability}} of the flame retardancy to washing of water soluble phosphate-based flame retardant on cotton fabric was studied. In this study, the poorly substantive phosphate treated fabric was further padded with chitosan solution. After drying, the chitosan formed film layer covering the fabric surface, resulting in the improved retention of the water soluble phosphate as evaluated by <b>washing</b> <b>test</b> and then followed by SEM analysis. The flame retardancy was then evaluated by LOI determination and burning behavior including 45 -degree flame spread rate were also investigated. In the study, the co-application of chitosan and sodium polyphosphate improved the durability of the flame retardancy in the cotton fabric by decreasing 45 -degree flame spread rate about 2. 5 times and slightly increasing the LOI values from 17 to 19 {{when compared to the}} untreated cotton fabric. Moreover, a carbonaceous char was formed and the afterglow was suppressed...|$|R
40|$|The tailing {{effect in}} the {{displacement}} washing operation of lime mud in the {{pulp and paper industry}} was investigated using two different model approaches. Both approaches utilise the dispersion model, the first approach adding micropore diffusion and particle size distribution, the second adding a disturbance in the inlet boundary condition. To investigate the models, <b>washing</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in an apparatus in which a filter cake was formed and subsequently washed. The parameters in the washing experiments were type of lime mud, type of salt as solute, flow velocity and bed length. It was found that a good fit could be obtained with the inlet disturbance model, while the micropore diffusion model could not explain the tailing in a satisfactory way. Furhtermore, {{it was found that the}} salt used had some influence on the dispersion, and that both the salt and the type of lime mud influenced the adsorption constant...|$|R
40|$|Design aspects and {{comparative}} performances of different laboratory formulations of wash primers were studied under laboratory and field conditions {{with reference to}} scratch hardness, flexibility, stability, resistance to corrosion and adhesiveness. The different formulations of single pack <b>wash</b> primers <b>tested</b> have shown superiority of the formulation prepared out of “mowital” {{and that it is}} comparable in performance to double pack wash primer...|$|R
