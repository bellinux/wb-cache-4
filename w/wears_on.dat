One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of phalluses that he <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> special occasions.|$|E

Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him that he does not need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E

5000|$|Shoulder sleeve {{insignia}} {{receive their}} {{name from the}} fact that they are most commonly <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper left shoulders of all U.S. Army uniforms, though they can be placed on other locations, notably a combat helmet. Shoulder sleeve insignia <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper right shoulders on Army uniforms denote former wartime service. These [...] "combat patches" [...] are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Combat Uniform but are not <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Service Uniform.

5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round <b>wears</b> <b>on.</b> In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level <b>wears</b> <b>on.</b> The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.|$|E

Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E

25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling of helplessness in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

25|$|On August 31, 2012, Dempsey joined Tottenham Hotspur on {{a three-year}} {{contract}} for a fee {{believed to be in}} the region of $9million. The deal made Dempsey the highest salaried U.S. soccer player of all time. With the 23 shirt that he wore at Fulham and the number 8 that he usually <b>wears</b> <b>on</b> international duty unavailable, he opted for the number 2 jersey, more usually associated with the right-back, which he wore at Furman University. Dempsey scored his first and the eventual match-winning goal for Tottenham in a 3–2 win over Manchester United. It {{was the first time in}} 23 years that Tottenham had won at Old Trafford. He scored his second goal for Spurs in the 39th minute in an away game at Southampton in October. Dempsey's third and fourth goals were scored against Everton in an eventual 2–1 loss and a deflected effort against Reading on New Year's Day to help his Spurs side win 3–1. In the FA Cup 3rd round he scored a double against Coventry City. On January 20, 2013, in driving snow at White Hart Lane against league leaders Manchester United, Dempsey was able to salvage a dramatic 1–1 draw for Spurs by slotting home a pass from Aaron Lennon in the 93rd minute. The goal was his fourth in four appearances in 2013. On January 27, 2013, Dempsey scored a looping header against Leeds United at Elland Road, in the FA Cup to bring the score to 2–1, however Tottenham Hotspur couldn't draw level throughout the rest of the game, leaving the result at 2–1 to Leeds at the whistle. Dempsey was unable to make an impression against his old club on March 17, when Fulham came away from White Hart Lane with a 1–0 victory. On April 21, Dempsey scored the first of three goals for Tottenham in a 3–1 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. On May 12, Dempsey scored a long range goal and added an assist while playing against Stoke City to help Spurs win 2–1 and keep them in contention for the fourth Champions League spot.|$|E
