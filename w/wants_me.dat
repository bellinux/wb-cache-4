500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa and stare at her with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> I'll be in my room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E

It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Currents {{has also}} been {{frequently}} characterised as a breakup album. Prior to recording, Parker {{made the decision to}} break up with French singer-songwriter Melody Prochet. Several songs on the album examine it from his angle as the instigator of the breakup, which consists of guilt and self-questioning. Parker downplayed the notion that the album was entirely aimed at former lovers, however, and likened it to an inner monologue: [...] "It's really me talking to myself, another part of myself... to my old self, the part of me that resists change and <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to stay as I am." [...] For Parker, the album meant [...] "looking forward and a sudden adoption of confidence."

While on the Asian {{leg of the}} Back to Basics Tour, {{during the summer of}} 2007, Aguilera said that her upcoming album would be, [...] "short, sweet and completely different" [...] from its predecessor. After the birth of her son Max, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a completely new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. In a February 2008 interview with People, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her Beverly Hills, California residence. DJ Premier, who, at the time, was working on projects for his record label Year Round Records, shared plans to head back into the studio with Aguilera, and stated: [...] "She's doing an all pop album again, but she <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to keep the tone like what we did before.

2500|$|In 2000, Santos had {{the lead}} role in Kahit Isang Saglit. She portrayed Annie, a budding {{architect}} romantically torn between two best friends (played by Piolo Pascual and Leandro Munoz). The film received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Santos and Pascual. Santos next appearance with Pascual was in the 2001 television series Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka as Patricia Montecillo, an illegitimate daughter in a constant struggle for acceptance and independence, dealing with an alcoholic abusive stepfather. Dez Lucero from Chic commended Santos' breakthrough and innovative portrayal, [...] "Patricia [...] here is a fighter who stands up to anyone bent on demolishing her [...] she is a survivor, she is sarcastic, she is street smart, she is strong." [...] Asked what she hoped to accomplish in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "After seeing me cry for years, I think the public now <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to make them laugh." [...] In the same year, Santos released her second album Bida Ng Buhay Ko. Singles from the album included [...] "Hello Goodbye", [...] "This Song's Dedicated To You", and [...] "Stop! Before You Break My Heart". The album was met with negative reviews. David Gonzales of AllMusic.com gave the album {{one out of five}} stars, stating, [...] "Santos is a popular young film actress, and this must be the reason why she has a recording contract. It isn't because of her singing, which ranges from bad to terrible. She sings in a low, whispery voice and hits many off-key notes throughout the album, which makes a listener cringe. Her voice is often difficult to hear above the backing instrumentation, but at least this spares a listener from more misery."

2500|$|In early 1844, Berlioz's highly {{influential}} Treatise on Instrumentation {{was published}} {{for the first}} time. At this time Berlioz was producing several serialisations for music journals which would eventually be collected into his Mémoires and Les soirées de l’orchestre (Evenings with the Orchestra). He took a recuperation trip to Nice late that year, during which he composed the concert overture La tour de Nice (The Tower of Nice), later to be revised and renamed Le Corsaire. With their marriage a failure, Berlioz and Harriet Smithson separated, the latter having become an alcoholic due {{to the collapse of}} her acting career. Berlioz moved in with a mistress Marie Recio. He continued to provide for Harriet {{for the rest of her}} life. He also met Mikhail Glinka (whom he had initially met in Italy and who remained a close friend), who was in Paris between 1844 and 1845 and persuaded Berlioz to embark on one of two tours of Russia. Berlioz's joke [...] "If the Emperor of Russia <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> then I am up for sale" [...] was taken seriously. The two tours of Russia (the second in 1867) proved so financially successful that they secured Berlioz's finances despite the large amounts of money he was losing in writing unsuccessful compositions. In 1845 he embarked on his first large-scale concert tour of France. He also attended and wrote a report on the inauguration of a statue to Beethoven in Bonn, and began composing La damnation de Faust, incorporating the earlier Huit scènes de Faust. On his return to Paris, the recently completed La damnation de Faust was premiered at the Opéra-Comique, but after two performances, the run was discontinued and the work was a popular failure (perhaps owing to its halfway status between opera and cantata), despite receiving generally favourable critical reviews. This left Berlioz heavily in debt to the tune of 5000 to 6000 francs. Becoming ever more disenchanted with his prospects in France, he wrote: ...|$|E

But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to smother him."

Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison.
