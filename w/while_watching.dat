5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided to anybody who died of fright <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> the film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, Nicol did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E

5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the book's publication, Garland had {{approached}} the film's producers—Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich—about a possible film, {{and wrote a}} 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, {{the head of the}} company financing the film, recommended her by text message <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers {{to have the opportunity to}} play the part.

He made his debut in Edmonton and wrestled in several matches there before moving to Tampa, Florida. Starting out, he wrestled for Independent Pro Wrestling, making $30 per match or less and sometimes competing in exchange for food and drinks. Juggernaut became known for his hardcore wrestling abilities, but he also impressed observers with his ability to perform a moonsault.|$|E

He developed the idea for Oobi <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> bare-handed puppeteers audition for Ulica Sezamkowa, the Polish adaptation of Sesame Street. Roles on Oobi were offered to veteran puppeteers from related Sesame Workshop shows. The Jim Henson Company, which designed and built the puppets on Sesame Street, held a stake in Noggin {{at the time of}} Oobis inception. Principal photography took place at Kaufman Astoria Studios, where Sesame Street is also taped.|$|E

5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The most {{difficult}} scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room.

He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying {{that she was able to}} be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary <b>while</b> <b>watching</b> Hannigan in the scene.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time.

Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E
