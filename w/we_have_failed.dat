25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

[...] Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so, Francis wrote that [...] "we are very much indebted to this gentleman [...] who has thus supplied us {{at a time when}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> in obtaining information through the appointed channel." [...] Upon the conclusion of the expedition in 1866, Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work. His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work, Remarks on the Natural History, Meteorology, and Native Population of Northern Australia.|$|E

500|$|She {{became the}} first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a , eight-day journey to Ghana, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast. Upon arrival to Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute {{reserved}} only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops. She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia's highest honor. In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation's Parliament. In the Ivory Coast, she was met by {{a quarter of a}} million people shouting [...] "Vive Madame Nixon!" [...] She conferred with leaders of all three African nations. Upon her return home, White House staffer Charles Colson sent a memo to the President reading in part, [...] "Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed...</b> People—men and women—identify with her, and in return with you." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat that I believe in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> {{and it will be a}} disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of [...] "instrumental transcommunication researcher" [...] Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: [...] "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> to replicate EVP in the strong sense." [...] The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.|$|E

At once we surmised a wedding breakfast, not more from the gaiety than the gravity of the guests; and the head waiter confirmed our impression: it was indeed a boda. The party was just breaking up, and as we sat down at our table the wedding guests rose from theirs. I do not know but in any country the women on such an occasion would look more adequate to it than the men; at any rate, there in Spain they looked altogether superior. It was not only that they were handsomer and better dressed, but that they expressed finer social and intellectual quality.|$|R
