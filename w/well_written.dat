Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, {{and a number of}} critics felt that it was unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found it <b>well</b> <b>written</b> and entertaining, others felt the tone was too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, Morris {{had become}} a public figure in Britain, {{resulting}} in repeated press requests for photographs, which he despised. That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eiríkr Magnússon. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed {{a keen interest in}} creating handwritten illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was A Book of Verse, completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were handwritten copies of Nordic tales such as Halfdan the Black, Frithiof the Bold, and The Dwellers of Eyr. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well as learning how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published Love is Enough, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the Mabinogion. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, The Novel on Blue Paper, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not <b>well</b> <b>written.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} Edo period, {{a master of}} haikai, Karai Senryū made an anthology. His style became known as senryū, after his pseudonym.

Anthologies of senryū in the Edo period collect many 'maeku' or senryū made by {{ordinary}} amateur senryū poets adding {{in front of the}} latter 7-7 part written by a master.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Dominic, John Bosco wrote his biography, The Life of Dominic Savio, which contributed to his canonisation. The {{original}} Italian edition was considered so <b>well</b> <b>written</b> during the time of Don Bosco that, along with his History of Italy and Ecclesiastical History, it was used in many public schools as part of the course materials on the Italian language.

25|$|Two years later, in 1562, another {{writer from}} the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, {{published}} the Cudesch da Psalms, {{a collection of}} church songs in the Vallader dialect. These early works are generally <b>well</b> <b>written</b> and show that the authors had {{a large amount of}} Romansh vocabulary at their disposal, contrary to what one might expect of the first pieces of writing in a language. Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives. In their prefaces, the authors themselves often mention the novelty of writing Romansh, and discuss an apparently common prejudice that Romansh was a language that could not be written.|$|E

25|$|Henry S. Commager, {{a scholar}} of the Revolutionary War, {{maintains}} that the best American accounts of the battle were recorded by ordinary soldiers and from civilian onlookers. British accounts however were primarily recorded by British generals such as Generals Howe, Gage and Burgoyne. He further maintains that the British accounts, although <b>well</b> <b>written</b> and chronicled, seemed {{as if they were}} prepared to be read in Parliament. The American accounts of the battle, though generally lacking in formal presentation, were direct and definitive, and possessed no sense of defeat or despair, though somewhat lacking in overall organization, reflecting the unconventional fighting style of the Americans. The witness accounts of both the Americans and the British naturally lent themselves to a fair measure of national pride respectively.|$|E
25|$|Beside its {{historical}} value, Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư is also considered an important {{work of the}} literature of Vietnam because Ngô Sĩ Liên often provided {{more information about the}} mentioned historical figures by the additional stories which were <b>well</b> <b>written</b> like a literary work. From various comments of Ngô Sĩ Liên, it seems that the historian also tried to define and teach moral principles based on the concept of Confucianism. For example, Ngô Sĩ Liên mentioned for several times the definition of a Gentleman (Quân tử) who, according to the historian, had to possess both good qualities and righteous manners, Ngô Sĩ Liên also emphasized the importance of the Gentleman in the dynastic era by pointing out the difference between a Gentleman and a Mean man (Tiểu nhân) or determining what would be the effectiveness of the example of such Gentlemen.|$|E
25|$|Phthalocyanine dye CD-Rs {{are usually}} silver, gold or light green. The patents on {{phthalocyanine}} CD-Rs {{are held by}} Mitsui and Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike cyanine, phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only {{after two weeks of}} direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser has to be more accurately adjusted for the disc {{in order to get a}} good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than <b>well</b> <b>written</b> discs (with lower correctable error rates).|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} time between the 1930s and the 1950s was one of growth and {{expansion}} for social group work (Alissi, 1980; Wilson, 1976). The economic despair of and varied psychosocial needs resultant of the Great Depression {{paved the way for}} greater affiliation between the social work profession and the field of group work (Alissi, 1980; Konopka, 1983; Wilson, 1976). The psychological needs of returning war veterans who served in World War II resulted in the more frequent application of social group work in psychiatric treatment (Konopka, 1983). During this {{period of time}} not only would the field of social group work debut at the National Conference for Social Work but additional advances would be made. Academic courses and research institutions were established; a professional organization was formed, The American Association of Social Work with Groups (AAGW); and a journal, The Group, was established. The first textbooks would appear as <b>well,</b> <b>written</b> by Harleigh Trecker (1948) and Gertrude Wilson and Gladys Ryland (1949).|$|E
25|$|Many barony lands were {{merged with}} other baronies {{at one time}} or other and {{therefore}} some of the associated moot hills would have ceased to have a role well before the demise of the baronial courts in 1747. Moot hills in this category may have remained as features of the landscape, but often without any local traditions relating to them being recorded. Place names are a guide, especially if local traditions have survived as <b>well.</b> <b>Written</b> records often survive, such as in 1346 a William Baillie, the Baillie of Lambistoun or Lambimtoun, vulgarly called Lamington is listed by Dalrymple amongst the prisoners taken by the English at the Battle of Durham which had taken place on 17 October of that year. He was {{in the company of a}} Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnock and Andrew Campbell of Loudoun. This helps to confirm that modern day Lambroughton was a barony. Pre-reformation and other old gravestones often recorded the occupation of the individual, especially if they had held important roles such a baron baillie.|$|E
25|$|Maxwell {{approached}} her agent for ideas. The agent {{suggested that she}} look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized {{that she would not}} enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were <b>well</b> <b>written,</b> she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last one that she read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her {{fall in love with the}} genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career. This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann's middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan's middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.|$|E
