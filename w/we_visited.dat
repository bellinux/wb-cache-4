We knew that the following Saturday , June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{confirmed}} in January 2014, a new court show conceived by Sheindlin titled Hot Bench debuted on September 15, 2014. The courtroom series features {{a panel of}} three judges debating and deciding on cases brought to their TV courtroom. Stated Sheindlin, [...] "When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling. I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds {{to serve as the}} judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a hot bench." [...] The panel of judges consist of New York State Supreme Court judge Patricia DiMango, and Los Angeles attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman. As with Judge Judy, Hot Bench is executive-produced by Randy Douthit, and produced by CBS Television Distribution. It {{is important to note that}} Sheindlin originally desired the title of her personal courtroom series to be [...] "Hot Bench" [...] before producers ultimately settled on [...] "Judge Judy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrien Jones, the {{president}} of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, said, [...] "Four years ago <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there.... It was a family secret for 600 years and even Mr. Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before <b>we</b> <b>visited,</b> refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Toole toured Australia in 1890, Vanbrugh was {{a member}} of his company, acting in every play in its repertoire. She later commented, [...] "I think this was even better {{training}} than Miss Thorne's school; not only was I constantly playing a new part, but I was constantly playing to a different type of audience. <b>We</b> <b>visited</b> all sorts of Australian cities, large and small, and one was pretty certain before long to find out the weak points in one's method." [...] On her return, she remained with Toole's company, and played her first original roles as Thea Tesman in James Barrie's, burlesque Ibsen's Ghost (1891), and as Bell Golightly in Barrie's Walker, London (1892).|$|E

2500|$|During {{his four}} decades as musical director, Godfrey took the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on many tours, {{including}} eleven to America. The company did not travel {{with a band}} but instead used orchestra players hired locally. [...] He recalled, [...] "We would pick up perhaps eight orchestral players in the first town, take them {{with us on the}} tour and make up the orchestra with local players from each of the towns <b>we</b> <b>visited....</b> On one occasion, I was rehearsing the Mikado overture when I noticed that one of the double-basses was plucking the strings in the opening bars. [...] I pointed out that {{it was not to be}} played pizzicato but arco, with the bow. 'Yeah', he said. 'But I haven't got a bow.' That's how it was sometimes!" ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>visited</b> {{refugee camps}} {{that had been}} created to house Tamil {{refugees}} from Jaffna. Their stories were brutal and shocking. Random shelling in areas of fighting — including after the government had announced an end to fighting. Men and boys taken away from refugee camps — and now out of contact. Tamil life treated as fourth or fifth class. If foreign policy is about anything, it should be about stopping this kind of inhumanity.............Restrictions on journalism meant {{that there was a}} war without witness in Sri Lanka.............It seems to us essential that this process is taken forward. As the report says, accountability is a duty under domestic and international law, and those responsible, including Sri Lanka Army commanders and senior government officials, would bear criminal liability for international crimes.............Kofi Annan has said that the international community cannot be selective in its approach to upholding the rule of law. We therefore call on our governments to set a deadline, soon, for satisfactory response from the Sri Lankan government, and if it is not forthcoming to initiate the international arrangements recommended by the report.............Reports like the one compiled for the secretary general must not stand on the shelf. They must be the basis of action. Or the law becomes an ass." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th.

Benteen and Lieut. Wallace {{on the morning of the}} 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time...I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement...My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.|$|E
