5|$|Native Americans {{used the}} {{occasion}} of the 175th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland in 1971 to protest the history of native mistreatment by non-natives, from massacres to Chief <b>Wahoo.</b> Protests have continued on Opening Day of the baseball season each year since 1973.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief <b>Wahoo.</b> Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

By late 1995, <b>Wahoo's</b> had six locations in total, five in Orange County, California and one in Denver, Colorado. The <b>Wahoo's</b> that opened in Manhattan Beach in 1998 was the first <b>Wahoo's</b> in California outside Orange County.

25|$|In mid-November Call tried again. His forces made {{it across}} the Withlacoochee this time, but found the Cove abandoned. Call divided his forces, and {{proceeded}} up the river (south) on both sides. On November 17 Seminoles were routed from a large camp. There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to be headed for the <b>Wahoo</b> Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the <b>Wahoo</b> Swamp on November 21. The Seminoles resisted the advance in the Battle of <b>Wahoo</b> Swamp, as their families were close by, but had to retreat across a stream. Major David Moniac, a mix-blooded Creek {{who was the first}} Native American to graduate from West Point, tried to determine how deep the stream was, but was shot and killed by the Seminoles.|$|E
25|$|Bud Selig (then-Commissioner of Baseball) said in 2014 that he {{had never}} {{received}} a complaint about the logo. He has heard that there are some protesting mascots, but individual teams such as the Indians and Braves should make their own decisions. Native Americans protested Chief <b>Wahoo</b> on Opening Day 2015, as they have for many years, making note that this is the 100th anniversary of the team becoming the Indians. Owner Paul Dolan, while stating he is respectful of critics, says he mainly hears from fans who want to keep Chief <b>Wahoo,</b> and has no plans to change.|$|E

40|$|Free-ranging {{adult male}} baboons give loud two-syllable ‘wahoo’ calls during dawn choruses, {{interactions}} between groups, when chasing females, and in aggressive interactions with other males. Previous {{research has shown}} that the rate and duration of these contest <b>wahoos</b> are correlated with a male’s competitive ability: high-ranking males call more often, call at faster rates, and call for longer bouts than do low-ranking males. Here we report that acoustic features of <b>wahoos</b> also reveal information about male competitive ability. High-ranking males give <b>wahoos</b> with higher fundamental frequencies (F 0) and longer ‘hoo’ syllables. Within-subject analyses revealed that, as males fall in rank, the hoo syllables tend to shorten within a period of months. As males age and continue to fall in rank, F 0 declines, hoo syllables shorten, and formant dispersion decreases. Independent of age and rank, within bouts of calling F 0 declines and hoo syllables become shorter. Because <b>wahoos</b> are often given while males are running or leaping through trees, variation in these acoustic features may function as an indicator of a male’s stamina. The acoustic features of contest <b>wahoos</b> thus potentially allow listeners to assess a male’s competitive ability...|$|R

Deep sea fishing beyond the reef in the Tongue of the Ocean offers dorado, tuna, sailfish, <b>wahoo,</b> and jacks. Locals fish regularly on the reef for abundant snapper and grouper.|$|E
25|$|When the Seminole Wars (1835–1842) broke out, Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service, leading 2 battalions to war, which {{accounted}} for about half {{the strength of the}} Marine Corps. They garrisoned Fort Brooke in Tampa and held off an Indian attack on 22 January 1836. Henderson commanded the mixed Marine/Army Second Brigade at the Battle of Hatchee-Lustee on 27 January 1837, for which he was appointed a brevet brigadier general.
