25|$|Unlike public <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>sanitation</b> is {{considered}} a sovereign core responsibility (hoheitliche Kernaufgabe) of municipalities in Germany. This implies that, unlike water supply, it is exempt from VAT and corporate taxes. It also implies that companies under private law cannot directly provide sanitation services. The great majority of municipalities thus provide sanitation directly through a municipal sanitation department (Regiebetrieb). Less than 10 percent of the 6,000 sanitation providers are utilities under public law, and none are utilities under private law. However, municipalities or municipal utilities can sign operating contracts (Betreiberverträge) with private companies. Out of the 900 largest sanitation service providers, about 10 percent have signed such contracts for sewerage services and 12 percent for wastewater treatment services.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{over time}} of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> sectors in four countries is analyzed to reveal the changing role of the private sector. In some cases, local, small-scale private <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> systems {{have been able to}} develop progressively into large-scale official systems, which may later be privatized. In other cases, foreign capital has been more significant in the development of modern <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> systems, particularly where privatization has occurred much earlier in the national development process. In much of the developing world, domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> is dominated not by the official <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> companies but by independent operators who function without subsidies but with enormous variability in terms of quality of service and prices offered. However, they are constrained generally by the absence of appropriate institutional and legal frameworks, including the lack of independent regulatory authorities. There is a need, where appropriate, to continue to encourage large-scale private sector involvement in the official <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> sectors of the developing world. At the same time though, it is only by promoting policies that also further the development (where appropriate) of the independent <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> providers that access to <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation</b> services can be maximized since better use of local resources in many developing countries, both local human resources and capital, provide a key means for improving access to <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>sanitation...</b>|$|R

The objective of the project was to improve the <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>sanitation</b> and sewerage services by strengthening the capacity of autonomous urban water supply authorities. To achieve this, water supply facilities have been extended and rehabilitated, sanitation facilitates have been upgraded and capacity building measures have been carried out, including improvement of IT systems used for billing.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{contributing}} factors to the outbreak was {{the breakdown of the}} municipal <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>sanitation,</b> and waste collection programs throughout the country, but especially in urban areas. With this, the onset of the rainy season led to cholera-contaminated faeces being washed into water sources, in particular public drains, as well as providing readily available but contaminated water. Due to a shortage of purification chemicals, such as chlorine, the capital city of Harare stopped receiving piped water on 1 December 2008. By that date, many suburbs had not had any water supply for much longer. On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe deputy minister for water and infrastructural development stated that there were only sufficient treatment chemicals in stock nationally for 12 weeks supply. The collapse of these systems was blamed on the then-current economic crisis; [...] many households cannot afford fuel to boil water. According to Médecins Sans Frontières, the spread of cholera from urban to rural areas from December 2008 onwards was due to infected city-dwellers visiting their families' rural homes for Christmas and the burial of infected city-dwellers in rural areas.|$|E
