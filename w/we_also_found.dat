Unlike most other Indo-Aryan languages, Marathi preserves all three grammatical genders from Sanskrit: masculine, feminine and neuter. The primary word order of Marathi is subject–object–verb Marathi follows a split-ergative pattern of verb agreement and case marking: it is ergative in constructions with either perfective transitive verbs {{or with the}} obligative ("should", [...] "have to") and it is nominative elsewhere. An unusual feature of Marathi, as compared to other Indo-European languages, is that it displays inclusive and exclusive <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in Rajasthani and Gujarati and common to the Austronesian and Dravidian languages.

The decoration of the walls was most elaborate, and, unlike the frescoes in the other buildings I had examined, portrayed many human figures in the compositions. These were of people like myself, and of a much lighter color than Dejah Thoris. They were clad in graceful, flowing robes, highly ornamented with metal and jewels, and their luxuriant hair was of a beautiful golden and reddish bronze. The men were beardless and only a few wore arms. The scenes depicted for the most part, a fair-skinned, fair-haired people at play.|$|E
60|$|Then we {{ran back}} toward the schools of tuna. On the way my brother hooked a Marlin {{swordfish}} that leaped thirty-five times and got away.

We found the tuna milling and lolling around, slowly drifting and heading toward the southeast. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> a very light breeze had begun {{to come out of}} the west. Captain Dan wanted to try to get the kite up, but I objected on the score that if we could fly it at all it would only be to drag a bait behind the boat. That would necessitate running through the schools of tuna, and as I believed this would put them down, I wanted to wait for enough wind to drag a bait at right angles with the boat. This is the proper procedure, because it enables an angler to place his bait over a school of tuna at a hundred yards or more from the boat. It certainly is the most beautiful and thrilling way to get a strike.|$|E

60|$|After {{the battle}} was over, the savages crowded round us and gazed at us in surprise, while they {{continued}} to pour upon us a flood of questions, which, being wholly unintelligible, of course we could not answer. However, by way of {{putting an end to}} it, Jack took the chief (who had recovered from the effects of his wound) by the hand and shook it warmly. No sooner did the blacks see that this was meant to express good-will than they shook hands with us all round. After this ceremony was gone through Jack went up to the girl, who had never once moved from the rock where she had been left, but had continued an eager spectator of all that had passed. He made signs to her to follow him, and then, taking the chief by the hand, was about to conduct him to the bower when his eye fell on the poor infant which had been thrown into the sea and was still lying on the shore. Dropping the chief's hand he hastened towards it, and, to his great joy, found it to be still alive. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that the mother was beginning to recover slowly.|$|E
60|$|We {{found that}} the Method of Agreement has the defect of not proving causation, and can, therefore, only be {{employed}} for the ascertainment of empirical laws. But <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> that besides this deficiency, it labors under a characteristic imperfection, tending to render uncertain even such conclusions {{as it is in}} itself adapted to prove. This imperfection arises from Plurality of Causes. Although two or more cases in which the phenomenon a has been met with may have no common antecedent except A, this does not prove that there is any connection between a and A, since a may have many causes, and may have been produced, in these different instances, not by any thing which the instances had in common, but by some of those elements in them which were different. We nevertheless observed, that in proportion to the multiplication of instances pointing to A as the antecedent, the characteristic uncertainty of the method diminishes, and the existence of a law of connection between A and a more nearly approaches to certainty. It is now to be determined after what amount of experience this certainty may be deemed to be practically attained, and the connection between A and a may be received as an empirical law.|$|E
