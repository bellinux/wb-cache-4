It received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001 (see: 2001 in literature).|$|E

25|$|Superman/Batman #76 {{looks at}} Superman's {{reaction}} to Dick Grayson assuming {{the role of}} Batman; initially angry at this perceived 'disrespect' to his friend's memory- regarding it as essentially Dick wearing Bruce's skin as Batman was the true identity-, a talk <b>with</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman helps Superman realise that he is simply lashing out over his grief at his friend's loss, and he later acknowledges Dick as the new Batman.|$|E

25|$|After the {{rebuilding}} of the city by Yaqub's brother, it became the dazzling capital of the Ghaznavids from 994 to 1160, encompassing much of North India, Persia and Central Asia. Many iconoclastic campaigns were launched from Ghazni into India. The Ghaznavids took Islam to India and returned with fabulous riches taken from both prince and temple god. Contemporary visitors and residents at Ghazni write <b>with</b> <b>wonder</b> of the ornateness of the buildings, the great libraries, the sumptuousness of the court ceremonies and of the wealth of precious objects owned by Ghazni's citizens.|$|E
25|$|He {{had a pair}} of engines on hand of {{the exact}} size.

The orders were executed with unfailing regularity, and he actually completed ninety sets of engines of 60 horsepower in ninety days – a feat which made the great Continental Powers stare <b>with</b> <b>wonder,</b> and which was possible only because the Whitworth standards of measurement and of accuracy and finish were by that time thoroughly recognised and established throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures <b>with</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E

25|$|In a {{different}} present day created by Flash's {{going back in}} time to stop his mother's death, Aquaman is shown to be more ruthless and bulkier. He and Wonder Woman attempted to have an alliance between Atlantis and Themyscira, ending up having an affair; his wife saw them and ended up perishing in a fight <b>with</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman to defend her claim on her husband. The resulting war caused chaos on a global scale, resulting in Aquaman's capture of Captain Atom; he had him used as the source of a bomb to take out the Amazons and himself as a last resort. At the end of the film, he does just that, forcing Flash to head {{back in time to}} avert the disaster and restore the true present day.|$|E

500|$|The gradual {{nature of}} the {{disaster}} was also more comforting, in some respects, compared {{with the nature of}} modern technological failures such as air crashes. Times reviewer made this point explicitly: [...] "This air age, when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it, can still turn <b>with</b> <b>wonder</b> to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer." [...] It was, as Steven Biel comments, [...] "a quainter kind of disaster" [...] in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die.|$|E
500|$|Batwoman {{subsequently}} {{appears in}} the fifty-two issue weekly series Countdown, intended {{to act as a}} prelude to DC's summer crossover event the following year. Batwoman appears in Countdown #39 (2007), after the Question confronts Trickster and Pied Piper, having trailed them from the Penguin's Iceberg Lounge nightclub. Batwoman also makes an appearance in the miniseries Crime Bible: The Five Lessons of Blood (2007) alongside the Question. Batwoman is seen again on the final page of Grant Morrison's Final Crisis #3 (2008), one month after the Anti-Life Equation was released, as a new Female Fury along <b>with</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman, Catwoman, and Giganta. Her costume bears resemblance to the dead Fury Mad Harriet. She is also seen in [...] #3 attacking the Question after having just been infected with the Anti-Life Equation.|$|E
500|$|As soon as {{the first}} world maps showing Brazil were printed in the Renaissance era of Albrecht Dürer, the {{recently}} discovered country aroused {{the interest of the}} German public. Among the first [...] attractions were the enthusiastic descriptions and illustrations of the Indians, the exotic landscapes, the abundance of wild animals and the new species of plants first conveyed in the works of Hans Staden. This was followed by the writings of adventurers and scientists such as Johann Baptist Emanuel Pohl, author of Viagem no Interior do Brasil, Empreendida nos Anos de 1817 a 1821 e Publicada por Ordem de Sua Majestade o Imperador da Áustria Francisco Primeiro (Voyage in the Interior of Brazil. Launched in the Years of 1817 to 1821 and Published by the Order of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria Franscisco First), in which he describes his journey through the country <b>with</b> <b>wonder</b> and enthusiasm, his words accompanied by luxuriant illustrations.

500|$|In his 1990 book Sea-Brothers: The Tradition of American Sea Fiction from Moby-Dick to the Present, author Bert Bender noted Crane's {{sympathetic}} {{portrayal of}} the oiler Billie, the most physically able of the four characters, and yet {{the only one to}} perish. The correspondent even notes <b>with</b> <b>wonder</b> Billie's exceptional ability to row despite having worked a double shift before the ship sank. Bender wrote that Crane [...] "emphasizes that Billie's steady, simple labor is the tangible basis for his role here as a savior," [...] and that the oiler's portrayal as a [...] "simple, working seaman, clearly expresses his sympathy with the democratic ideal of the sailor before the mast that figures so crucially in the tradition of American sea fiction." [...] That Billie does not survive the ordeal, however, can be seen as an antithesis to Darwinism in that the only person to not survive was in fact the strongest physically.|$|E
500|$|A pair of {{alternative}} history novels King and Joker (1976) and Skeleton in Waiting (1990), written by Peter Dickinson, are {{the adventures of}} a [...] fictitious royal family descended from an Albert Victor who survived and reigned as King Victor I.*Dickinson, Peter (1990).

New York: Pantheon Books[...] In Gary Lovisi's parallel universe Sherlock Holmes pastiche, [...] "The Adventure of the Missing Detective", Albert Victor is portrayed as a tyrannical king, who rules after the deaths (in suspicious circumstances) of both his grandmother and father. The Prince also appears as the murder victim {{in the first of}} the Lord Francis Powerscourt crime novels Goodnight Sweet Prince, and as a murder suspect in the novel Death at Glamis Castle by Robin Paige. In both The Bloody Red Baron (volume 2 of Anno Dracula series) by Kim Newman and the novel I, Vampire by Michael Romkey, he has become a vampire. In the former, he is the British monarch during World War I.
