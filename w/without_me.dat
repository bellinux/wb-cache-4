After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E

His remarks about the possibility that the World Trade Center was demolished with explosives were also repeated in newspaper and television stories following some of the interviews.|$|E

500|$|During the Second World War, the King and Queen became {{symbols of}} the fight against fascism. Shortly after the {{declaration}} of war, The Queen's Book of the Red Cross was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton's portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the Red Cross. Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when she was advised by the Cabinet to do so. She declared, [...] "The children won't go <b>without</b> <b>me.</b> I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyric [...] "Boy, you actin’ so corny like Fritos" [...] {{generated}} {{a positive response}} from both critics and fans alike, with MTV News reporting that fans were [...] "freaking" [...] over it. Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as [...] "hilarious", while Camp likened it {{to a form of}} product placement. Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus, [...] "Close the door/Lose the key/Leave my heart on the mat for me/I was yours eternally/There's an end to infinity" [...] and one of the verses, [...] "Name hold weight like kilos/Boy you actin' so corny like Fritos/Wouldn't have none of that <b>without</b> <b>me,</b> though/Ain't none of my business, it's tea though/Outta ammo, gotta reload/If life was a game you're a free throw/It's nothing that you don't already know," [...] noting that the former is [...] "almost sweet" [...] compared to the latter.|$|E

And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me." [...] She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place. Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere <b>without</b> <b>me</b> at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out <b>Without</b> <b>Me?,</b> Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go <b>without</b> <b>me.</b> I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E

Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song <b>without</b> <b>me.</b> That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all <b>without</b> <b>me.</b> I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful.

They spent Christmas at Sandringham House before moving to Windsor Castle, just outside London, {{for much of the}} remainder of the war. Viscount Hailsham wrote to Prime Minister Winston Churchill to advise the evacuation of the princesses to the greater safety of Canada, to which their mother famously replied, [...] "The children won't go <b>without</b> <b>me.</b> I won't leave without the King.
