5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded.

5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized {{to account for the}} asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E

5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> <b>was</b> in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch).

25|$|As the {{universe}} expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the energy {{density of the}} plasma to decrease until it became favorable for electrons to combine with protons, forming hydrogen atoms.

25|$|The {{difficulty}} in forming a supermassive black hole {{resides in the}} need for enough matter {{to be in a}} small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order for this to happen. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> <b>was</b> less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.|$|E

25|$|Antiparticles {{are also}} {{produced}} in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy {{greater than the}} pair production threshold).

The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called baryon asymmetry.
