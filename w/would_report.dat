5|$|Sejm deputies doing {{legislative}} {{work were}} generally {{not able to}} act as they pleased. Regional szlachta assemblies, the sejmiks, were summoned before sessions of general sejm; there the local nobility provided their representatives with copious {{instructions on how to}} proceed and protect the interests of the area involved. Another sejmik was called after the Sejm's conclusion. At that time the deputies <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to their constituency on what had been accomplished.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} generals' plot, Đính sent Colonel Nguyễn Hữu Có, {{his deputy}} corps commander, to Mỹ Tho {{to talk to the}} 7th Division commander, Colonel Bùi Đình Đạm, and two regimental commanders, the {{armoured}} unit commander, both subordinate to Đạm, and the chief of Mỹ Tho province. Exhorting them to join the coup, he stated that all the generals were in the plot except the strongly loyalist Huỳnh Văn Cao, and that Đính would soon join. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists <b>would</b> <b>report</b> Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories <b>would</b> <b>report</b> on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, King Leopold II started to receive {{criticism}} for his treatment of the natives in Congo Free State. In the United States, the main outlet of this criticism was the Presbyterian church. In 1891, Sheppard became involved with William Morrison after Lapsley's death. They <b>would</b> <b>report</b> the crimes they saw, and later, {{with the help of}} Roger Casement, would form the Congo Reform Association (CRA), one of the world's first humanitarian organizations.|$|E

White also scored 7 points and totaled 4 assists.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} assigned labour quotas {{for each}} district to native commissioners across the territory {{who in turn}} called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers. The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal and who <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to the district native commissioner for work. This system, known locally as the chibaro, cibbalo, isibalo or chipara—according to Charles van Onselen, synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery—had been relatively widespread during Company rule (1890–1923), but {{had fallen out of}} use by the 1930s. Some tribal communities were resettled {{to make room for the}} airstrips.|$|E

5|$|Although the Vice President Henry A. Wallace {{had been}} {{involved}} in the Manhattan Project since the beginning, his successor, Harry S. Truman, was not briefed on the project by Stimson until April 23, 1945, eleven days after he became president on Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. On May 2, 1945, Truman approved the formation of the Interim Committee, an advisory group that <b>would</b> <b>report</b> on the atomic bomb. It consisted of Stimson, James F. Byrnes, George L. Harrison, Vannevar Bush, James Bryant Conant, Karl Taylor Compton, William L. Clayton, and Ralph Austin Bard, advised by scientists Robert Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Arthur Compton. In a June 1 report, the Committee concluded that the bomb should be used as soon as possible against a war plant surrounded by workers' homes and that no warning or demonstration should be given.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Southard {{returned}} to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized. He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third <b>would</b> <b>report</b> on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted {{orders for}} MacArthur authorizing nuclear attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese {{launched}} airstrikes originating from there against his forces. The next day Truman {{met with the}} chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to the Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there.

Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, AAU {{announced}} extensive {{reforms to}} their governance. The president would remain {{the chief executive}} officer. The post of college director would be removed and the duties undertaken by the college dean who would be {{chief executive officer of}} the college. The chain of command would be reduced from six or more layers to two layers below vice-president. The new structure would be: a) governing board, b) president with inputs from senate, managing council and university council, c) four vice-presidents, an executive director for the college of health sciences, institutes of technology and institute of peace and security studies <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to the president, d) colleges/institutes <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to the president, and e) departments/schools/centers <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to colleges/institutes.

25|$|The war brought no {{immediate}} great {{changes to the}} line which maintained its level of service until 1916. A procedure was established for the reporting of enemy aircraft: Brighton <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to Lewes Main Junction and Keymer Junction, Lewes would then contact Groombridge Junction which would advise the two Tunbridge Wells stations, Groombridge, Eridge, Ashurst Junction, Forest Row, Withyham and Hartfield. Keymer Junction <b>would</b> <b>report</b> to Three Bridges which would in turn advise Rowfant and East Grinstead High Level. The latter would advise the Low Level, Kingscote and West Hoathly.From 1917 two services were withdrawn and staff shortages led to female ticket collectors being employed.|$|E
