25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E

The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E

500|$|... "Blow" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Klas Åhlund, Lukasz Gottwald, Alan Grigg, Benjamin Levin and Max Martin. Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the line [...] "We’re taking over" [...] is representative of herself and her fans, which she explained during an interview with Beatweek Magazine, [...] "I love that I say ‘we’re taking over’ in it because my fans and me have started a cult. We’re misfits of society but we’ve banded together and we’re starting a revolution. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> over. So get used to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2008, Radar Online {{reported}} that the Church of Scientology asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the DDoS attacks. An unnamed source told Radar that the Church of Scientology argued to law enforcement that the Internet attacks are a form of [...] "illegal interference with business." [...] Radar also {{reported that}} in statements to law enforcement the Church of Scientology emphasized {{its status as a}} religious organization in the United States in order to assert that the DDoS attacks can be classed as hate crimes. The day after the Church of Scientology complained to law enforcement about the DDoS attacks, one of the main Project Chanology sites was down, and a message on the site said that their site crashed due to attacks from Scientologists. In a statement issued to Wikinews, a Church of Scientology employee confirmed that actions of Anonymous had been reported to law enforcement: [...] "Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken. Their activities are illegal and we do not approve of them. At the same time, our main work is to improve the environment, make people more able and spiritually aware. ... yes, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> action." ...|$|E

60|$|But, I must confess, I was {{surprised}} at the aspect of things in the night here.

40|$|The US dietary {{guidelines}} are being updated, new dietary guidelines for older Australians were released last year, and Australia and New Zealand are jointly reviewing recommendations for nutrient intakes.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> {{an early}} dinner at this house, {{on the day}} after our arrival, which was Sunday, when a {{steamboat}} came in sight, and presently touched at the wharf.

2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> cities; when we come back, we shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E
2500|$|Upon GOD's announcement, Alex Seropian, {{co-founder of}} Bungie, {{expressed}} confidence in MumboJumbo's {{ability to create}} a worthy successor to the original games, stating [...] "MumboJumbo has a real appreciation for what made the first two Myth games great. We're confident that their knowledge and experience will make Myth III a title that satisfies existing Myth fans and brings legions of new gamers into the fold." [...] Also addressing the issue of remaining faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the idea with The Wolf Age was not to reinvent the series' basic gameplay, which the developers felt was still capable of supporting a unique title. However, at the same time, they were also keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise even before we go in a somewhat different route. Although, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated ...|$|E

2500|$|Jasek {{explained}} {{that when the}} team were {{given the chance to}} shoot a big event, like a wedding, that involved all of the cast, it was [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] to heighten the drama and have the event effect the whole community. He continued [...] "These events are always challenging {{but at the same time}} exciting for our crews because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> a different approach and there is an action element to it the cast love." [...] Moloney agreed and said that it felt different when the cast and crew shot big scenes like the explosion. Greg Barnett, the Commissioning Editor of Entertainment and Soaps from Channel 5, stated that there would be [...] "unmissable" [...] drama during the wedding and the storyline would feature [...] "one of the biggest stunts the series has experienced in a while". Toadie's previous bad luck on his wedding days had led him to believe he was cursed. His wedding to Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) in 2003 resulted in her death after they plunged over a cliff on the way to the honeymoon. In 2008, Toadie was left at the altar by Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) and in 2010, he entered into a sham marriage with her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{account by}} the Blackwater firm {{stated that the}} driver of the Kia sedan had kept driving toward the convoy, {{ignoring}} verbal orders, hand signals, and water bottles which were thrown at the car, and continued to approach even when fired upon. [...] An Iraqi policeman went over to the car possibly to help the passenger, but the vehicle kept moving and it looked to the guards as if the policeman was pushing it. In their view, this confirmed that they were under attack by a vehicle bomb, whereupon they fired at the car, killing both people in it as well as the Iraqi policeman. In response to the guards' killing of the Iraqi policemen, other Iraqi police officers began to fire at the Blackwater men. [...] Since insurgents in Iraq often disguise themselves by wearing police uniforms, the guards could not be sure they were dealing with actual police. [...] They communicated to the State Department operations center that they were under attack. A State Department employee who was walking into the department's Baghdad operations center {{on the day of the}} incident heard a radio call from the convoy: “Contact, contact, contact! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> fire from insurgents and Iraqi police.” According to Blackwater vice-president Marty Strong, the convoy was hit with [...] "a large explosive device" [...] and [...] "repeated small arms fire" [...] which disabled a vehicle. Several sources have stated that the explosion was caused by a mortar round, though this is not reflected in the Department of State incident report. Blackwater has denied Iraqi allegations that one of their helicopters fired from the air during the incident.|$|E

[...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future.
