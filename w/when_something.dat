5|$|Highly {{combustible}} materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens <b>when</b> <b>something</b> burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E
5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged <b>when</b> <b>something</b> is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as <b>when</b> <b>something</b> in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so <b>when</b> <b>something</b> like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|They are {{critical}} methods, having, like all criticism, {{the power to}} do good <b>when</b> there is <b>something</b> that must be destroyed, dissolved, or reduced, but capable only of harm <b>when</b> there is <b>something</b> to be built (Jung, 1966: par. 65).|$|R
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. <b>When</b> <b>something</b> is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E

25|$|Caves {{are often}} {{described}} as entries into the watery Maya underworld. For Mesoamerican groups, including the Maya, life and death occur at liminal zones between this world and the otherworld. Caves then are both associated with life and death; <b>when</b> <b>something</b> emerges from the underworld, that something lives, and <b>when</b> <b>something</b> descends into the underworld, that something dies. Caves are seen as birthplaces where humans and group ancestors were born (and live) and the Maya of the Yucatán even thought that the sun and moon were born out of the underworld.|$|E
25|$|The stones' gaze can pierce {{anything}} except darkness and shadow. A technique called shrouding was used <b>when</b> <b>something</b> {{was to be}} kept secret from an enemies' eyes. Knowledge of this technique was lost long ago.|$|E

25|$|Hero Points are {{generally}} awarded to a player by the Game Master <b>when</b> <b>something</b> bad befalls the character, {{such as the}} villain escaping without them having a chance of stopping him. This is particularly encouraged if the bad thing in question is something related {{to one of their}} disadvantages, and many disadvantages provide no other benefit aside from acting as a source of Hero Points.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{stonefish}} {{which can}} shoot venom, the lionfish can only release venom <b>when</b> <b>something</b> strikes its spines. Although not {{native to the}} US coast, lionfish have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York. They are attractive aquarium fish, sometimes used to stock ponds, {{and may have been}} washed into the sea during a hurricane. Lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.|$|E
5000|$|Stantons {{favorite}} {{big league}} at-bat came on September 6, 2010, against Roy Oswalt in Philadelphia. Stanton {{thought he had}} struck out on a foul tip, but the catcher dropped the ball. On the next pitch, he hit a 435-foot home run. [...] "That (home run) I really liked, because thats what made me grow", Stanton said. [...] "I thought I struck out; I was a little flustered.

25|$|They {{typically}} forage {{by keeping}} their heads {{close to the}} ground, jabbing their bills into mud <b>when</b> <b>something</b> edible is encountered. When capturing fish or other slippery prey, they may quickly jab {{in a similar fashion}} to a heron. Although animal prey can be swallowed whole, usually red-crowned cranes more often tear up prey by grasping with their bills and shaking it vigorously, eating pieces as they fall apart. Most foraging occurs in wet grasslands, cultivated fields, and shallow rivers, or on lakeshores.|$|E
25|$|Don Eleuterio was {{depicted}} in the early incarnations of the character as a grumpy old man, easily angered by life's minor irritations. Recent incarnations depict him as less irritated (and more tolerant) than before. However, Eleuterio is still prone to fits of anger, and throws things quite loudly whenever he loses an argument and proof is shown to him, or <b>when</b> <b>something</b> personal happens to him that goes against his political philosophy (such as his son Elpidio joining a PDP campaign rally for a joyride, for example).|$|E
25|$|On Saturday morning, June 25, 1977, Sullivan {{was struck}} while fishing in a {{freshwater}} pool. The lightning hit {{the top of}} his head, set his hair on fire, traveled down, and burnt his chest and stomach. Sullivan turned to his car <b>when</b> <b>something</b> unexpected occurred — a bear approached the pond and tried to steal trout from his fishing line. Sullivan had the strength and courage to strike the bear with a tree branch. He claimed that this was the twenty-second time he hit a bear with a stick in his lifetime.|$|E
