5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a fairly simple welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic <b>welding</b> <b>technique.</b> Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The actual <b>welding</b> <b>technique</b> {{utilized}} {{depends on}} the electrode, {{the composition of the}} workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{metalworking}} {{industry has}} instituted specifications and codes to guide welders, weld inspectors, engineers, managers, and property owners in proper <b>welding</b> <b>technique,</b> design of welds, how {{to judge the}} quality of Welding Procedure Specification, how to judge the skill of the person performing the weld, and how {{to ensure the quality}} of a welding job. Methods such as visual inspection, radiography, ultrasonic testing, phased-array ultrasonics, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, or industrial computed tomography can help with detection and analysis of certain defects.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty was encountered {{with the}} uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow {{had to be}} coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure {{rate of more than}} 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved <b>welding</b> <b>technique</b> with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with <b>welding</b> <b>technique.</b> The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a minimalist neural regression network as an aggregate of independent identical regression blocks that are trained simultaneously. Moreover, it introduces a new multiplicative parameter, {{shared by all}} the neural units of a given layer, to maintain {{the quality of its}} gradients. Furthermore, it increases its estimation accuracy via learning a weight factor whose quantity captures the redundancy between the estimated and actual values at each training iteration. We choose the estimation of the direct weld parameters of different <b>welding</b> <b>techniques</b> to show a significant improvement in calculation of these parameters by our model in contrast to state-of-the-arts techniques in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our model to retain its performance when presented with combined data of different <b>welding</b> <b>techniques.</b> This is a nontrivial result in attaining an scalable model whose quality of estimation is independent of adopted <b>welding</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R
500|$|Electron beams {{are used}} in welding. They allow energy densities up to [...] across a narrow focus {{diameter}} of [...] and usually require no filler material.

500|$|Some [...] of {{graphite}} blocks {{were purchased}} from National Carbon. The construction crews began stacking them in September 1943. Cast uranium billets came from Metal Hydrides, Mallinckrodt and other suppliers. These were extruded into cylindrical slugs, and then canned. The fuel slugs were canned {{to protect the}} uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it {{came into contact with}} water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen as it transmitted heat but did not absorb too many neutrons. Alcoa started canning on June 14, 1943. General Electric and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new <b>welding</b> <b>technique</b> to seal the cans airtight, and the equipment for this was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a <b>welding</b> <b>technique</b> that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual spot welds. [...] In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{aluminum}} structures {{have shown}} to be more vulnerable to fatigue, either due to ineffective alloys, or imperfect <b>welding</b> <b>technique</b> being used. This contrasts with some steel and titanium alloys, which have clear fatigue limits and are easier to weld or braze together. [...] However, some of these disadvantages have since been mitigated with more skilled labor capable of producing better quality welds, automation, and the greater accessibility to modern aluminum alloys. Aluminum's attractive strength to weight ratio as compared to steel, and certain mechanical properties, assure it a place among the favored frame-building materials.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. 3 CR 12 is a {{corrosion}} resistant steel that {{was developed in the}} 1980 ‚Äôs as an alternative to coated mild steel in the construction industry. The low chromium content together with an absence of nickel result in a competitative production cost. It has good welding characteristics when compared to the other ferritic grades. Because of the cost and difficulties involved, structural hot-rolled sections in 3 CR 12 (or any other stainless steel for that matter) are not commercially available. Sections are either cold formed or built-up through various <b>welding</b> <b>techniques.</b> Design in cold formed stainless steel sections are done in accordance to the SABS 0162 - 4 : 1997 code of practice. In general welded built-up sections should comply with the SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 code of practice. Little is known about the structural behaviour of built-up stainless steel and particularly 3 CR 12 fabricated sections. Currently sections are fabricated using both manual metal arc and laser welding. The effect of using different <b>welding</b> <b>techniques</b> (which has become common practice) is totally unexplored. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate the structural behaviour of built-up 3 CR 12 sections when fabricated by using either manual metal arc or laser <b>welding</b> <b>techniques.</b> The investigation was initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review with specific reference to built-up 3 CR 12 structural sections. This is followed by an experimental investigation utilizing the neutron diffraction technique to determine the typical residual stress profile associated with manual metal arc and laser-welded built-up 3 CR 12 sections. This data is then used as input to a non-linear finite element investigation where the effect of the residual stress profile on the structural integrity of selected axial structural members (columns) is evaluated. An experimental program where a selected number of full scale fabricated sections were tested as axial members was then conducted to act as comparison and validation of the numerical model. The research found that both the <b>welding</b> <b>techniques</b> investigated may be successfully used to fabricate the structural sections. There is however a distinct difference in the residual stress profile within the sections between the two <b>welding</b> <b>techniques.</b> Laser <b>welding</b> induces smaller compressive residual stresses in the flange end regions when compared to manual metal arc welding. This has a beneficial effect on the axial buckling strength of the axial members. The difference could be up to about 8 % depending on the slenderness ratio and the column in question. SANS 0162 - 1 : 2005 was found to adequately describe the column behaviour for the sections tested as far as design is concerned...|$|R
