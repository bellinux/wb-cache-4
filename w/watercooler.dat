500|$|During {{a feature}} on what storylines were working and {{not working for}} the show, a Soap World {{columnist}} praised the character, saying [...] "Naomi Canning has been perhaps the best new character {{of the last few}} years. Her cougar/cub sex fling with Josh is pure hotness and tends towards the controversial, thus providing good <b>watercooler</b> moments for fans." [...] The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying [...] "Naomi has also been {{a breath of fresh air}} as a character who will push the boundaries just that little bit more than many of her neighbours!" ...|$|E
500|$|Cox was 30 {{years old}} at the time she was cast, making her the show's second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the {{beginning}} of Friends final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica's lines emphatically. Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time in a coffee house, Cox herself does not drink coffee, and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox's own cleanliness closely resembles her character's; at times the actress would clean her co-stars' dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character's motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica she was able to [...] "bring more of my own personality to her, and I've never really been able to do that before." [...] Starpulse.com observed that [...] "As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of <b>watercooler</b> storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross." [...] At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character's lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character's storylines gradually began to improve.|$|E
6000|$|Tom Poppins {{was very}} cordial to them. He dragged brown canvas stools {{out of the}} tobacco-scented room where cigars were made, {{and the three of}} them squatted {{in the back of the}} store, while Tom gossiped of the Juarez races, Taft, cigar-wrappers, and Jews. Morton was aroused to tell the time-mellowed story of the judge and the darky. He was cheerful and laughed much and {{frequently}} said [...] "Ah there, cull!" [...] in general commendation. But he kept looking at the clock on the jog in the wall over the <b>watercooler.</b> Just at ten he rose abashedly, hesitated, and murmured, [...] "Well, I guess I'll have to be beating it home." ...|$|E

6000|$|If the {{appointment}} {{was not present}} fortune, {{it was the beginning}} of the best luck I have had in the world, and I am glad to owe it all to those friends of my verse, who could have been no otherwise friends of me. They were then beginning very early careers of distinction which have not been wholly divided. Mr. Nicolay could have been about twenty-five, and Mr. Hay nineteen or twenty. No one dreamed as yet of the opportunity opening to them in being so constantly near the man whose life they have written, and with whose fame they have imperishably interwrought their names. I remember the sobered dignity of the one, and the humorous gaiety of the other, and how we had some young men's joking and laughing together, in the anteroom where they received me, with the great soul entering upon its travail beyond the closed door. They asked me if I had ever seen the President, and I said that I had seen him at Columbus, the year before; but I could not say how much I should like to see him again, and thank him for the favor which I had no claim to at his hands, except such as the slight campaign biography I had written could be thought to have given me. That day or another, as I left my friends, I met him in the corridor without, and he looked at the space I was part of with his ineffably melancholy eyes, without knowing that I was the indistinguishable person in whose [...] "integrity and abilities he had reposed such special confidence" [...] as to have appointed him consul for Venice and the ports of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, though he might have recognized the terms of my commission if I had reminded him of them. I faltered a moment in my longing to address him, and then I decided that every one who forebore to speak needlessly to him, or to shake his hand, did him a kindness; and I wish I could be as sure of the wisdom of all my past behavior as I am of that piece of it. He walked up to the <b>watercooler</b> that stood in the corner, and drew himself a full goblet from it, which he poured down his throat with a backward tilt of his head, and then went wearily within doors. The whole affair, so simple, has always remained one of a certain pathos in my memory, and I would rather have seen Lincoln in that unconscious moment than on some statelier occasion.|$|E

50|$|Thermosiphons {{are used}} for <b>watercooling</b> {{internal}} computer components, most commonly the processor. While any suitable liquid can be used, water is the easiest liquid to use in thermosiphon systems. Unlike traditional <b>watercooling</b> systems, thermosiphon systems do not rely on a pump but on convection for the movement of heated water (which may become vapour) from the components upwards to a heat exchanger. There the water is cooled and {{is ready to be}} recirculated. The most commonly used heat exchanger is a radiator, where air is blown actively through a fan system to condense the vapour to a liquid. The liquid is recirculated through the system, thus repeating the process. No pump is required—the vaporization and condensation cycle is self-sustaining.|$|R
