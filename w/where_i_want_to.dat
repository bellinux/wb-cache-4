I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go with the future.|$|E

500|$|Clinton Heylin {{and writer}} Christopher Ricks {{discussed}} Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin {{said that in}} [...] "Ballad of Easy Rider", co-written by Dylan and Roger McGuinn two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while [...] "The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be"; by contrast, in [...] "Watching the River Flow", Dylan writes {{that he wants to}} be moving, wishing he was [...] "back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied bucolic notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the [...] "choppy" [...] rhythms and [...] "stroppy stomping" [...] of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with [...] "People disagreeing", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is [...] "tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates the lure of the lazy".|$|E

In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting.

500|$|Murs' fourth studio album, Never Been Better, was {{released}} on 20 November 2014. Murs stated that he wanted the album {{to have a more}} serious tone and less of a [...] "cheeky" [...] style owing to him turning 30 years old. Travie McCoy and Demi Lovato feature on the songs [...] "Wrapped Up" [...] and [...] "Up", respectively. The former is a funk track which whereby Murs suggestively sings [...] "You got the lock, I got the key/ You know the rest, you know just <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be," [...] while the latter is a folk song about the [...] "merits of perseverance".

Murs co-wrote the track [...] "Let Me In" [...] with Paul Weller, which was described by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph as [...] "unexpected".

Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs.

Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always {{be a little bit of}} trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical.

[...] Deryck and McCaslin would often argue about the songs' sound and how the bass and guitar should progress through the songs.

Gunn wanted to give the sequel a different structure from the first film, since [...] "one of the reasons people like Guardians is because it's fresh and different, so the second one will be fresh and different from the first one." [...] Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore Drax the Destroyer, Nebula, Kraglin, and the Collector, and expand on Xandarian, Kree, Krylorian, and Ravager culture. He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though wanted to avoid including [...] "earthlings" [...] such as Carol Danvers, as well as Novas Richard Rider or Sam Alexander, saying, [...] "I think Quill being the only earthling is important.
