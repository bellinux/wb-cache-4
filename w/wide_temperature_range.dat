5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} in a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly different {{from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> beryllium metal {{is used for}} lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization can be {{performed}} in large range of solvents (including water), within a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> high functional group tolerance and absence metals for polymerization. As of 2014, the range of commercially available RAFT agents covers close to all the monomer classes that can undergo radical polymerization.|$|E

25|$|Tantalum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with solid electrolyte as surface-mountable chip capacitors are mainly used in electronic devices in which little space is available or {{a low profile}} is required. They operate reliably over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> without large parameter deviations. In military and space applications only tantalum {{electrolytic capacitors}} have the necessary approvals.|$|E
25|$|RAFT {{polymerization}} {{today is}} mainly {{carried out by}} thiocarbonylthio chain transfer agents. It was first reported by Rizzardo et al. in 1998. RAFT {{is one of the}} most versatile methods of controlled radical polymerization because it is tolerant of a very wide range of functionality in the monomer and solvent, including aqueous solutions. RAFT polymerization has also been effectively carried out over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|Class 1 {{capacitors}} include capacitors {{with different}} temperature coefficients α. Especially, NP0/CG/C0G capacitors with an α ±0•10−6/K and an α tolerance of 30ppm are technically of great interest. These capacitors have a capacitance variation dC/C of ±0.54% within the temperature range −55 to +125°C. This enables accurate frequency response over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> (in, for example, resonant circuits). The other materials with their special temperature behavior {{are used to}} compensate a counter temperature run of parallel connected components like coils in oscillator circuits. Class 1 capacitors exhibit very small tolerances of the rated capacitance.|$|E
5000|$|Thermocouples {{are useful}} over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>ranges</b> from {{cryogenic}} <b>temperatures</b> to over 1000°C, but typically have an error of ±0.5-1.5°C.|$|R

25|$|Because {{water has}} good {{properties}} as a coolant, water plus antifreeze {{is used in}} internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the additive (pure concentrate) and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{and then}} {{machining}} plutonium is difficult {{not only because}} of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different metallic phases. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30-35 mMol (0.9–1.0% by weight) gallium, forming a plutonium-gallium alloy, which causes it to take up its delta phase over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b> When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other trivalent metals would also work, but gallium has a small neutron absorption cross section and helps protect the plutonium against corrosion. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to plutonium dioxide for power reactors, there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.|$|E
500|$|The spores of U.craterium have a {{rapid and}} high {{percentage}} of germination. Germination requires only 1.5hours, {{a relatively short time}} compared to another inoperculate species in the same family, Sarcoscypha coccinea, which requires 48hours. Furthermore, germination is possible under a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> from [...] to , and wide soil pH range; {{the quality and quantity of}} light does not affect germination, although prolonged exposure to light does reduce germination efficiency.|$|E

50|$|An {{air-cooled}} engine contracts and expands with its <b>wider</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> requiring looser tolerances, and giving shorter engine life. The <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of an air-cooled two-stroke {{is even more}} extreme and component life even shorter than in an air-cooled four-stroke.|$|R

500|$|C.maenas {{can live}} in all types of {{protected}} and semi-protected marine and estuarine habitats, including habitats with mud, sand, or rock substrates, submerged aquatic vegetation, and emergent marsh, although soft bottoms are preferred. C.maenas is euryhaline, meaning that it can tolerate {{a wide range of}} salinities (from 4 to 52‰), and survive in temperatures of [...] The wide salinity range allows C.maenas to survive in the lower salinities found in estuaries, and the <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> allows it to survive in extremely cold climates beneath the ice in Winter. A molecular biological study using the COI gene found genetic differentiation between the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and even more strongly between the populations in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and those elsewhere. This suggests that C.maenas is unable to cross deeper water.|$|E
2500|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{made with}} lower-cost plastics {{are used for}} non-critical applications which do not require ultra-stable characteristics over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> such as for smoothing or AC signal coupling. [...] Polyester film (KT) capacitors of the [...] "stacked" [...] type are often used now instead of polystyrene capacitors (KS), which have become less available.|$|E
2500|$|Thermistors can be {{classified}} into two types, depending on the classification of '.

[...] If ' is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a ' [...] as close to 0 as possible, so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Transmission lines {{built in}} Manitoba must {{withstand}} a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> ice, and occasional high winds. [...] In 1997, a tornado blew down 19 transmission {{towers of the}} HVDC system north of Winnipeg, reducing transmission capacity from the North to {{a small fraction of}} system capacity. During the several days required for utility employees to repair this line, power was imported from the United States over the 500 kV interconnection. As a consequence, though some major industrial customers were requested to curtail energy use, disruption for most customers remained small.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the engine coolant gets too hot, it might boil while inside the engine, causing voids (pockets of steam), leading to {{localized}} hot spots and the catastrophic {{failure of the}} engine. If plain water were {{to be used as}} an engine coolant, it would promote galvanic corrosion. Proper engine coolant and a pressurized coolant system can help obviate the problems which make plain water incompatible with automotive engines. With proper antifreeze, a <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> can be tolerated by the engine coolant, such as [...] to [...] for 50% (by volume) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} film {{capacitors}} {{is the possibility}} of choosing different film materials for the dielectric layer to select for desirable electrical characteristics, such as stability, <b>wide</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range,</b> or ability to withstand very high voltages. Polypropylene film capacitors are specified because of their low electrical losses and their nearly linear behavior over a very wide frequency range, for stability Class 1 applications in resonant circuits, comparable only with ceramic capacitors. For simple high frequency filter circuits, polyester capacitors offer low-cost solutions with excellent long-term stability, allowing replacement of more expensive tantalum electrolytic capacitors. [...] The film/foil variants of plastic film capacitors are especially capable of handling high and very high current surges.|$|E
