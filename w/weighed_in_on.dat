5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible.

25|$|Germans vigorously {{opposed the}} trial. They denied the facts {{found by the}} U.S. judges, extolled the defense of {{obedience}} to superior orders, and praised the soldierly qualities of the defendants. Particularly active were the Protestant and Catholic churches. After {{the emergence of the}} Federal Republic, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and the Bundestag <b>weighed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the side of the defendants. German leverage increased as the urgency of rearming Germany grew. Under these intense pressures, in 1950, U.S. High Commissioner John McCloy established a review panel chaired by Judge David Peck of New York and, on its recommendation, reduced the sentences of three of the six High Command defendants still in prison. After further proceedings by mixed commissions composed of Allied and German members, the last of the High Command defendants returned home in 1953.|$|E
25|$|International {{experts have}} also <b>weighed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who {{also worked with}} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil {{might be on the}} path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E
