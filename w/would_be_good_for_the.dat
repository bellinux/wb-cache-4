5|$|It was {{reported}} that Madonna's appearance on the show was to promote her album American Life (2003). Many believed that the guest spot on the show <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> singer, following her appearance in the film 2002 film Swept Away, which was a box office disappointment. Her manager, however, insisted that Madonna's guest spot was not an attempt to showcase her acting abilities.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

500|$|Some Republican leaders criticized Emanuel's {{appointment}} {{because they}} believed it went against Obama's campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham disagreed, saying: [...] "This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He's tough but fair, honest, direct and candid." [...] Ira Forman, {{executive director of the}} National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the [...] "wrong people" [...] regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship.

500|$|Moore {{performed}} {{his first}} solo show {{at a small}} club in Istanbul on March 23, 2007. The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I thought that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first show {{to be sort of}} small and comfortable... so I thought we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} Bond girl Honey Ryder, Julie Christie was considered, but {{discarded}} as the producers {{felt she was}} not voluptuous enough. Just two weeks before filming began, Ursula Andress was chosen to play Honey after the producers saw {{a picture of her}} taken by Andress' then-husband John Derek. To appear more convincing as a Jamaican, Andress had a tan painted on her and ultimately had her lines redubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl due to Andress' heavy Swiss German accent. For Bond's antagonist Dr. No, Ian Fleming wanted his friend Noël Coward, and Coward answered the invitation with [...] "No! No! No!" [...] Fleming considered that his step-cousin, Christopher Lee, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Dr. No, although by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the part. Harry Saltzman picked Wiseman because of his performance in the 1951 film Detective Story, and the actor had special make-up applied to evoke No's Chinese heritage.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, ISC began {{scouting}} {{sites in}} Washington and Oregon {{for a new}} track to attract fans from around the Pacific Northwest, eventually settling on a site near Marysville, Washington in Snohomish County north of Seattle. Although the plan was met with some resistance from residents [...] particularly those living near {{the site for the}} planned speedway [...] local business owners and other residents were in favor of the plan, believing that the track <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area's economy and would create jobs. Unlike ISC's later proposal in New York, the Marysville proposal would be supported by public funds raised through taxes, {{in much the same way}} as other sports venues in the area (KeyArena, Safeco Field, CenturyLink Field). The track would have been publicly owned and leased to ISC. In November 2004, local officials and ISC announced that they could not go through with the deal, saying that the costs for that particular site would be too high.|$|E
500|$|The efforts {{undertook}} {{to control the}} gold market and help the national economy {{set the stage for}} a major financial scandal. Jay Gould, a Wall Street trader and railroad magnate, and financier Jim Fisk, seeking to drive up the gold price, enlisted the help of another speculator Abel Corbin, Grant's brother-in-law, who used his connection with the president to get inside information (the collaborators were later known as the [...] "Gold Ring.") Corbin and Gould lobbied for and convinced Grant to appoint Gould's associate, Daniel Butterfield, as Assistant Treasurer, allowing Butterfield to gather information for the Ring. Meanwhile, Gould and Fisk quietly stockpiled gold. Gould convinced Corbin that a high gold price <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nation's prosperity, and Corbin passed this theory on to Grant, who allowed the Treasury to act accordingly. After consulting in early September with Alexander Stewart (his erstwhile nominee for Treasury Secretary), Grant stopped the sale of gold, believing a higher gold price would help Western farmers.|$|E

500|$|As {{they had}} no {{permanent}} drummer, McCartney looked for someone to fill the position, which was difficult, as Lennon later said that drummers were [...] "few and far between", because a set of drums was an expensive item. Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club (which was run by his mother, Mona Best). He {{was regarded as a}} steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm, and was known in Liverpool at the time as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent" [...] by female fans, which convinced McCartney he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg, telling him they would earn £15 per week each. Best had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, as he had passed his school exams, unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.|$|E
500|$|Having no {{permanent}} drummer, Paul McCartney looked {{for someone to}} fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing in the Casbah with his own group, the Black Jacks, and {{it was noted that}} he was a steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm. In Liverpool, his female fans knew him as being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent", which convinced McCartney he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney convinced Best to go to Hamburg with the group, by saying they would each earn £15 per week (equivalent to £ in [...] ). As Best had passed his school exams (unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs), he had the chance to attend teacher-training college, but he decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move. Best had an audition in the Jacaranda club, which Williams owned, and travelled to Hamburg the next day. Williams later said that the audition with Best was unnecessary, as the group had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} by creator Aaron Ruben, Andy Griffith Show producer Sheldon Leonard (in partnership with Griffith), and Ronald Jacobs; it was co-produced by Bruce Bayley Johnson and Duke Vincent. Among the writers were Sam Bobrick, Harvey Miller, Aaron Ruben, Jack Elinson, and Bill Idelson; Andy Griffith Show writers Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell also wrote episodes. Coby Ruskin was the primary director {{in the first four}} seasons, before John Rich took over the role for the fifth season; other directors included Gary Nelson, Peter Baldwin, and Alan Rafkin. Ruth Burch {{was in charge of the}} casting, and John Finger directed the cinematography. The theme song was composed by Earle Hagen, who also composed the themes for shows such as The Andy Griffith Show, The Dick Van Dyke Show, and That Girl. The show was filmed at Camp Pendleton, Desilu Studios's Desilu-Cahuenga, and RKO Forty Acres backlot, where The Andy Griffith Show was filmed. Though Ruben preferred the use of a multiple-camera setup for comedy programs, Gomer Pyle used a single-camera setup because much of the shooting was conducted outdoors. In his book And The Show Goes On, Sheldon Leonard explained that the armed forces offer levels of [...] "cooperation" [...] with filmmakers. Because the Marines felt that the show <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> branch's image, Gomer Pyle was given [...] "total cooperation," [...] meaning that the show was allowed unlimited access to military equipment.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to combat these efforts, Douglass {{supported}} the presidential campaign of Ulysses S. Grant in 1868. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the New National Era, attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality. President Grant sent a Congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, {{on a mission to}} the West Indies to investigate if the annexation of Santo Domingo <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South allowing African Americans their own state.
