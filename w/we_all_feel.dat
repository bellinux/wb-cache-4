25|$|Pownoll's {{death was}} widely mourned, Pellew writing {{in his report}} to the Admiralty that: 'The loss of Captain Pownoll will be {{severely}} felt. The ship's company have lost a father. I have lost much more, {{a father and a}} friend united; and that friend my only one on earth. Never, my lord, was grief more poignant than that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>feel</b> for an adored commander. Mine is inexpressible.' Admiral John Jervis wrote of him that he was ‘the best officer, & most excellent, kind hearted man in the Profession’, and claimed that he had ‘lost the best Partizan, if not the best officer under every line of description in the Service’. Edward Osler wrote in 1835 that 'St Vincent and Pownoll who were brought up under Boscawen, and received their Lieutenant's commission from him, contributed materially to form a Nelson or an Exmouth; each the founder of a school of officers, whose model is the character of their chief, and their example his successes.' As well as Pellew, John Borlase Warren served under Pownoll and {{went on to become a}} leading frigate captain, while Jervis remembered Pownoll's contribution to the navy in 1804, when he promoted Pownoll's grandson, John Bastard. Pellew named his eldest son Pownoll Bastard Pellew in honour of his former captain and his family.|$|E

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were very {{emotional}} during filming, as they were concerned {{that this might be}} the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one.

At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next show is that we do together, is something that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>feel</b> is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it.

[...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows?

Every {{one of us has}} been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt {{that we are in the}} midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.|$|E
