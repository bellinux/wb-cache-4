25|$|While many {{algorithms}} {{reach an}} exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that {{is closer to}} the true solution. Approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the Knapsack problem. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> weights of items as well as their value.|$|E

2500|$|Including {{members of}} the general public in the {{discussion}} was regarded (or at least articulated) as very important to the Commission's deliberations. In fact, FCC Commissioner Bellows noted at the time that [...] "it is the radio listener <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> above everyone else."

In September 2007 Tancredo defended his remarks: [...] "I still believe it is something <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> as a possible deterrent because at the present time there are no negative consequences that would accrue to the people who commit a crime such as a nuclear, chemical or biological attack." ...|$|E

He stated that [...] "I mean, you [...] must trust an insider as a member of your clique. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> as insiders those persons who are sympathetic towards our revolution, our state and Islam.

2500|$|Canadian {{ecologist}} Patrick Moore, {{a former}} Greenpeace founding member, is {{a critic of}} the organization. In addition, Patrick Moore had once spoken out against nuclear power in 1976, but today he supports it, along with renewable energy sources. In Australian newspaper The Age, he writes [...] "Greenpeace is wrong — <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> nuclear power". He argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels [...] or greenhouse gas emissions need increased use of nuclear energy. [...] Phil Radford, Executive Director of Greenpeace US responded that nuclear energy is too risky and takes too long to build to address climate change. Radford asserts that the U.S. can shift to nearly 100% renewable energy while phasing out nuclear power by 2050.|$|E

Hence the question no longer is as to whether perpetual peace is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must act on the supposition of its being real."
