500|$|Moyler {{felt that}} the {{combination}} of [...] "I Can't Go for That" [...] and [...] "You Make My Dreams" [...] was [...] "an abomination" [...] and [...] "New Directions at their worst". He summarized: [...] "The outfits are hokey, the dance is silly, and the music has absolutely no emotion in it." [...] Slezak, however, issued the performance an [...] "A–" [...] grade, and wrote, [...] "The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle, but I loved the frothy, silly spirit of this number, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> dressed like Miami Vice extras, Puck and Blaine rocking Oatestaches, and Tina getting a little moment on lead vocals." [...] Votta characterized the performance as a [...] "fun, retro number", and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was similarly pleased, and gave it a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Buchanan {{described}} the song {{during an interview}} that was published on the group's official website, saying: [...] "Easy is a very naughty and cheeky song – it’s the most sexy song we’ve ever done. It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> from Orson the sound just blew us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel (Lea Michele) {{discovers that}} rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline is {{planning}} on performing a Lady Gaga number at Regionals, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) sets the club a Gaga assignment. The girls and Kurt (Chris Colfer) create costumes inspired by Lady Gaga and perform [...] "Bad Romance". The {{rest of the}} male club members, unwilling to do a Gaga number, dress as Kiss and perform [...] "Shout It Out Loud". Puck (Mark Salling) suggests to Quinn (Dianna Agron) that they name their daughter Jackie Daniels, as in Jack Daniel's. Later, {{in an attempt to}} show her he is serious about being a father, he does another Kiss song <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> [...] "Beth", and suggests that Quinn give that name to their daughter. Quinn agrees that he can be present at her birth.|$|E
500|$|Asked in November 2016 {{about his}} plans after Black Sabbath's final tour, Iommi replied, [...] "I'll be doing some writing. Maybe I'll be doing {{something}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> maybe in the studio, but no touring." [...] The band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham. The final song was streamed live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi {{has said that he}} does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, [...] "I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know if that would happen." [...] In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to 13, but added that, [...] "the tour got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 1983, Howard Emerson, the {{adviser to}} the journalism class, {{submitted}} page proofs of the May 13 issue of the newspaper to principal Robert Eugene Reynolds for approval, a practice that was customary at the time. Reynolds objected {{to two of the}} stories scheduled to run. One was about teen pregnancy, containing interviews with three students who had been pregnant. The story used false names to keep the girls' identities a secret, but Reynolds was concerned that the students would still be identifiable from the text. He was also concerned that the references to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for younger students at the school. The second story was about divorce and featured an interview with a student whose parents were divorced, in which she complained that her father [...] "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister, and I ... was always out of town on business or out late playing cards <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> ... always argued about everything". Reynolds, unaware that the girl's name would also be changed, argued that her family should have been given an opportunity to respond within the story, or to object to its publication.|$|E

500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|Speaking at a {{press conference}} after the match, Murray said, [...] "As it is, I'd be very {{surprised}} if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> tonight and make a plan {{for the next few days}} then make a decision on Paris after the next five days." [...] He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury. After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Čilić in three sets to claim his third title at Queen's Club.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, a Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars-inspired space fight is shown between Stewie, Rupert, and a giant {{spaceship}} {{in the shape of}} Peter's head, along with a series of lookalike TIE fighters. In addition, Stewie paraphrases a series of lyrics from the 1972 single [...] "Rocket Man" [...] by singer-songwriter and composer Elton John. When Brian's script is brought up during breakfast, Peter mentions his own idea for a script entitled Bigger Jaws, in which the shark from the 1975 film Jaws has to team up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys,</b> including Martin Brody, Quint and Matt Hooper, to go after him to get [...] "bigger Jaws." [...] After it is produced, Peter already has a sequel in mind called Way Bigger Jaws. A historical cutaway gag portrays Adolf Hitler thinking he is being rejected by the publishing house for his submission of the autobiographical Mein Kampf, in which a publisher tells him, [...] "We didn't like it... we loved it!" [...] – to which Hitler replies, [...] "I could have killed you, Mr. Weinberg!" [...] Most of the storyline following Stewie, Chris and Meg is an homage to the 1989 film Weekend at Bernie's. The episode's title is also a reference to the TBS series Tyler Perry's House of Payne. As the family gathers around the television to watch Brian's show, actors Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer and Angus T. Jones of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men appear in the Griffin family living room, with Sheen attacking Brian for always criticizing their show.|$|E
