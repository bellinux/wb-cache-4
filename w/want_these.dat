25|$|After {{the success}} of Bublé's self-titled debut, DRG Records belatedly {{released}} the soundtrack from the 2001 film, Totally Blonde {{in which he had}} a co-starring role as a nightclub singer and club owner. DRG ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover, making it appear as if this was a proper Michael Bublé release. The slight misrepresentation was not lost on Bublé, who stated on his website that he did not <b>want</b> <b>these</b> songs released but that it was out of his control.|$|E

He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on civil liberties and constitutional grounds. Frank said of the vote, [...] "I think it's very likely to be found unconstitutional. [...] It's true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when you let them provoke you into overdoing it.

One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year.

500|$|The {{character}} has been positively received for his development in Mortal Kombat: Deception, while several gaming media outlets have rated him {{among the top}} characters of the Mortal Kombat series. GamesRadar commented in 2014: [...] "This red-clad ninja {{might not be as}} iconic as Sub-Zero or Scorpion, but it's hard not to love Ermac for his ... supernatural, Sith-like powers of telekinesis." [...] While Ermac and Mortal Kombat's other male ninjas ranked third on GamePro's 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer wrote in 2010 that he did not <b>want</b> <b>these</b> characters, aside from Scorpion and Sub-Zero, in future series installments, while Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot felt the unlocking of Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was [...] "a hassle".

500|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} set in The Hamptons, a wealthy enclave in New York, but {{was transferred to}} London when Allen found financing for the film there. The film was partly funded by BBC Films, which required that he make the film in the UK with largely local cast and crew. In an interview with The Guardian, Allen {{explained that he was}} allowed [...] "the same kind of creative liberal attitude that I'm used to", in London. He complained that the American studio system was not interested in making small films [...] "They only <b>want</b> <b>these</b> $100 million pictures that make $500m." [...] A further change was required when Kate Winslet, who was supposed to play the part of Nola Rice, resigned a week before filming was scheduled to begin. Scarlett Johansson was offered the part, and accepted, but the character had to be re-written as an American. According to Allen, [...] "It was not a problem...It took about an hour." ...|$|E

500|$|Time workers—workers {{who were}} {{paid for the}} time they spent working rather than by how much they {{individually}} produced—also received bonuses based on performance. Factory managers, who did not <b>want</b> <b>these</b> workers to lose out to their piece-rate colleagues, often manipulated output figures {{to ensure that they}} would (on paper) overfulfill their targets and therefore receive their bonuses. Typically, managers were loath to see their employees' wages fall too low, so they frequently kept quotas deliberately low, or offered ways for workers to manipulate their work outputs to achieve a higher bonus. They generally did this to ensure that their factory could run smoothly, rather than out of concern for the workers' personal welfare. The erratic and seemingly arbitrary way that quotas had been set across different industries led to a high level of uncompleted production in industries where it was more difficult to overfulfill production quotas. Managers [...] therefore tried to keep quotas deliberately low to attract workers to their factories to ensure their factories were able to meet their targets.|$|E

In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. And yet they maintain these files about what people have said to them in private sessions. Why would you <b>want</b> <b>these</b> people to hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E

Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws. VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups [...] "It's a form of identity theft to the artists...
