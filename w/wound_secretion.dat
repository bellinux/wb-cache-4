40|$|Abstract Background We {{report a}} case of mucormycosis in a healthy 17 -year-old {{accident}} victim with multiple abdominal injuries which was caused by infection with Absidia Corymbifera, a ubiquitous saphrophyte in the ground. Case presentation The patient was admitted to hospital with massive abdominal trauma. During an 8 -hour emergency operation he received transfusions of compacted red blood cells, plasma, platelets and hemagel. He developed a crush syndrome with acute renal failure, resolved with extra-corporeal dialysis and had to undergo splenectomy because of spleen hematoma. As <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> and central venous catheter (CVC) blood cultures and drainage fluid were positive for Enterococcus Faecium, Providentia Rettgeri, Hafnia Alvei and Candida Albicans, tecoplanin, metronidazole, imipenem, and flucanozole were administered. Although the CVC was changed high fever persisted and discharge continued from the large abdominal wound. Repeated tampons in different sections and <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> smears were positive for A. corymbifera. Flucanozole was stopped and liposomal amphotericin (Ambisome; 5 mg/Kg i. v.) given for over 3 months. The patient improved; fever gradually disappeared. After 8 days, tampons and <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> smears were negative for A. corymbifera. No other fungal infections developed. Drainage fluid was later positive for tecoplanin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas Aeroginosa responding only to meropenem and ciprofloxacin. Abdominal computerized tomography visualized fluid accumulation around the iliac-femoral bypass. Abcess was ruled out when scintigraphy showed no tracer uptake. The lesion was drained. Drainage fluid cultures were negative for bacteria and fungi. Fluid accumulation gradually disappeared with prolonged antibiotic and antifungal therapy. One year after the accident the patient is in good health, with normal quality of life. Conclusion Successful outcome was due to early, specific antifungal therapy, at sufficiently high dosage which was prolonged for an adequate period of time. Early diagnosis of mucormycosis is essential for efficacious anti-fungal treatment and prevention of irreversible spread of mucormycosis to vital organs. It presupposes awareness that A. corymbifera infection can develop in healthy individuals who are stressed and traumatized through skin-ground contact in accidents. </p...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{clotting}} factor XIII has different {{functions in the}} process of wound healing. An increased consumption and resulting differences in the “local” activity of factor XIII in larger wounds is assumed. Therefore 68 patients, who had to undergo surgery of malignant ENT-tumors, were investigated in search for a prognosis for wound healing disturbances. Besides pre- and postoperative activity of factor XIII in plasma the concentration of factor XIII in <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> {{during the course of the}} first postoperative days and the content of factor XIII of different intraoperative taken tissue samples in relation to their protein content were measured. 17 patients were treated prophylactically with 1250 IE factor XIII concentrate (Fibrogammin®) at the second, 4 th and 6 th postoperative day. Regarding the risk for wound healing disturbances the patients were classified into a high-risk and a low-risk group according to a risk score. The determination of factor XIII concentrations in <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> showed a typical course with steady concentration loss. Neither the factor XIII concentration in <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> nor the relative factor XIII content of the tissue samples allowed a forecast of wound healing. It could be observed that in particular high-risk patients with wound healing disturbances in the course showed significantly more often pathological factor XIII plasma activities on the first postoperative day. The same was observed in patients substituted with Fibrogammin®. High-risk patients developed wound disorders more frequently than low-risk patients. The substitution with Fibrogammin® didn´t effect the wound healing in the low-risk group. High-risk patients with substitution of Fibrogammin® developed wound healing disturbances more frequently than high-risk patients without substitution, but in particular this group showed pathological factor XIII plasma activities on the first postoperative day more often. In addition the treatment with Fibrogammin® was started only on the second postoperative day. These results allow the assumption of an hypothetic benefit of high-risk patients with pathological factor XIII plasma activities on the first postoperative day from a prophylactic treatment with Fibrogammin® if the substitution is begun earlier...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} a real-time quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction(QR-PCR) method for rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens in wound secretion,so as {{to provide a}} new means to diagnose gas gangrene early and quickly. Methods The 16 s rDNA gene sequence of Clostridium perfringens downloaded from GenBank {{was used as a}} template,and the specific primers and probes were designed according to the conserved region. The PCR amplified products were ligated to plasmid pMD 19 -T and used as the standard of the quantitative determination,and then the standard curve was generated based on the determination results. The reaction condition and reaction system of the established QR-PCR were optimized,and the specificity,sensitivity,reproducibility and feasibility of the assay were verified. Results The established QR-PCR method showed a high specificity for Clostridium perfringens,and no cross-reaction with 23 other associated bacteria was observed. The sensitivity was 9 × 102 cfu/ml,i. e. 9 cfu per reaction. The reaction system showed a high stability and the time spent for the whole operation process was only 3 hours. The results of 5 suspected <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> detected by the established QR-PCR were identical with that of bacterial culture. Conclusion The established QR-PCR assay is a quick,sensitive and specific method for determination of Cl. perfingen,and it can be used in routine test and batch emergency examination(in war or unexpected events) for Clostridium perfringen in <b>wound</b> <b>secretion...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{implantation}} {{of joint}} prostheses, {{especially for the}} hip and knee, is becoming increasingly common. This provides {{a significant reduction in}} discomfort and an immeasurable improvement in patient mobility. Reviews of the worldwide literature indicate that 1 to 5 % of these prostheses become infected, although {{it is important to remember}} that as the number of operations performed to implant these prosthesis increases, so will the number of cases of this type of infection. Gram-positive bacteria predominate in contaminations of joint prostheses, in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and fungi such as Candida sp have been reported with increased frequency throughout the world. Infections of joint prostheses present characteristic signs that can be divided into acute manifestations (severe pain, high fever, toxemia, heat, redness and <b>wound</b> <b>secretions)</b> and chronic manifestations (progressive pain, cutaneous fistula formation and pus drainage, without fever). The definitive diagnosis of the infection should be made through cultures to isolate the microorganism, using material collected from joint fluid puncture, surgical <b>wound</b> <b>secretions,</b> and surgical debridement. It is essential to cover for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, given the epidemiological importance of this agent in these infections. The total duration of antibiotic therapy ranges from six weeks to six months, and this treatment should be adjusted as needed, based on the results from culturing...|$|R
40|$|Lymphedema {{of the arm}} is {{the most}} common and {{impairing}} complication after breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Our prospective study evaluated the effect of two different surgical techniques for ALND on postoperative morbidity. Patients were scheduled to undergo ALND.

Patients in group 2 (n = 17) underwent a modified standard technique of ALND with clamping and ligatures of all resection margins. Postoperative <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> was quantified and patients were followed up for 6 months to assess long-term morbidity. The variations in surgical technique had no significant influence on the outcome variables. However, patients in group 2 showed a tendency to less <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> (713 versus 802 mL; P = nonsignificant), a decreased rate of immediate postoperative seromas (11. 8 versus 23. 5 %; P = nonsignificant) and less lymphedema after 3 months (29. 4 versus 41. 2 %; P = nonsignificant).

MALP- 2 is a toll-like receptor 2 / 6 agonist, acts as an immunological adjuvant, and has been described recently to prolong survival in a mouse model of an orthotopic, syngeneic pancreas tumour. Male and female patients with incompletely resectable pancreas carcinomas were eligible while those with R 0 or R 1 resections or with peritoneal carcinosis were excluded. Ten patients were injected intratumourally during surgery with 20 – 30 [*]μg MALP- 2 followed by postoperative chemotherapy. Samples were taken from peripheral blood and <b>wound</b> <b>secretion,</b> and assayed for cell content, cytokine and CRP levels, and NK activity. An MALP- 2 dose of 20 [*]μg was well tolerated. Clear signs of local MALP- 2 effects were presented by the influx of lymphocytes and monocytes in wound secretions, and abolishment of inhibition of NK activity. The actual mean survival is 17. 1 ± 4. 2 months; the median survival being 9. 3 months. Two patients are still alive after 31 months.

40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{has been designed}} to measure the penetration by rubbing of bacteria from cloth contaminated in the nursing of burn patients through fabrics designed for barrier garments. Most fabrics tested dry reduced the transfer of bacteria from the source cloth to about 10 %, irrespective of the results of air filter tests, which agrees with mock nursing results. When the fabrics were tested against a wet surface, the transfer of bacteria rapidly reached 100 % if the fabrics had a high wettability, but was slower for fabrics with a low wettability. Through closely woven waterproofed cotton, transfer was 5 [...] 25 %, but increased three- to four-fold after ten launderings, in line with the water absorption. Transfer through plastic-laminated material was less than 1 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assessment of {{incidence}} {{and behavior of}} mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation. METHODS: From 1985 to 1999, 214 cardiac transplantations were performed, 12 (5. 6 %) of the transplanted patients developed confirmed mediastinitis. Patient's ages ranged from 42 to 66 years (mean of 52. 3 ± 10. 0 years) and 10 (83. 3 %) patients were males. Seven (58. 3 %) patients showed sternal stability on palpation, 4 (33. 3 %) patients had pleural empyema, and 2 (16. 7 %) patients did not show purulent secretion draining through the wound. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the infectious agent identified in the <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> or in the mediastinum, or both, in 8 (66. 7 %) patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 2 (16. 7 %) patients, Enterococcus faecalis in 1 (8. 3 %) patient, {{and the cause of}} mediastinitis could not be determined in 1 (8. 3 %) patient. Surgical treatment was performed on an emergency basis, and the extension of the débridement varied with local conditions. In 2 (16. 7 %) patients, we chose to leave the surgical wound open and performed daily dressings with granulated sugar. Total sternal resection was performed in only 1 (8. 3 %) patient. Out of this series, 5 (41. 7 %) patients died, and the causes of death were related to the infection. Autopsy revealed persistence of mediastinitis in 1 (8. 3 %) patient. CONCLUSION: Promptness in diagnosing mediastinitis and precocious surgical drainage have changed the natural evolution of this disease.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Conventional haemorrhoidectomy (CH) is {{well known}} to cause {{significant}} post-operative pain and delayed return to daily activities. Both surgical wounds and sphincterial apparatus spasms are likely responsible for the pain. In this study, we evaluated the role of glyceryl trinitrate ointment (GTN) in reducing post-operative pain, ameliorating wound healing and recovery after CH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 01 / 08 and 12 / 11, 203 patients with symptomatic haemorrhoids {{were enrolled in the}} study and received (103 patients) or not (100 patients) 0. 4  % GTN ointment for 6  weeks after surgery. Pain was assessed using a 10 -cm linear visual analogue scale (VAS). Data on post-operative pain, <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> and bleeding, return to normal activities and complications were recorded. Data were analysed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: GTN-treated group experienced significantly less pain during the first week after surgery (p[*] [*] 7) (10  % vs 31  %). There were significant differences in terms of secretion time (p[*]=[*] 0. 0052) and bleeding time (p[*]=[*] 0. 02) in favor of GTN. In addition, the duration of itching was less in the GTN group (p[*]=[*] 0. 0145). Patients treated with GTN were able to an early return to daily activities compared to untreated (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Fifteen GTN-treated patients (14. 6  %) discontinued the application because of local discomfort and headache. CONCLUSIONS: GTN ointment enhances significantly post-operative recovery, reducing pain in terms of duration and intensity. This effect might be secondary to a faster wound healing expressed by reduced secretion, bleeding and itching time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sternal wound infections (SWIs) can be {{subdivided}} into two types, superficial or deep, that require different treatments. The clinical diagnosis of superficial SWI is normally easy to perform, whereas {{the involvement of}} deep tissues is frequently difficult to detect. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for an imaging study that permits the assessment of SWIs and is able to distinguish between superficial and deep SWI. The present work was a prospective study aiming to evaluate the role of technetium- 99 m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99 mTc-HMPAO) labelled leucocyte scan in SWI management. Twenty-eight patients with suspected SWIs were included in the study. On the basis of clinical examination they were {{subdivided into}} three groups: patients with signs of superficial SWI (group 1), patients with signs of superficial SWI and suspected deep infection (group 2) and patients with suspected deep SWI without superficial involvement (group 3). Ten patients previously submitted to median sternotomy, but without suspected SWI, were also included in the study as a control group (group 4). All patients with suspected SWI had bacteriological examinations of <b>wound</b> <b>secretion,</b> if present. In addition 99 mTc-HMPAO labelled leucocyte scan was performed in all patients. The patients of groups 1, 2 and 3 were treated on the basis of the clinical signs and microbiological findings, independently of the scintigraphic results. The patients of group 4 did not receive treatment. The final assessment of infection was based on histological and microbiological findings or on long-term clinical follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values for scintigraphic and non-scintigraphic results were calculated.

30|$|Some of the {{detected}} bacteria (CoNS and Kocuria sp.) {{are part}} of the normal skin microbiota. It is important to determine whether the isolation of these bacteria represents true infection or colonisation. The latter is quite common during specimen collection in patients with a long hospital stay. CoNS have emerged as predominant pathogens in HAIs and are recognised as the most common causes of bloodstream infection (BSI). Infection with CoNS is usually related to the use of intravascular devices, such as central venous catheters, peripheral venous catheters, haemodialysis catheters, and prosthetic materials. In this study, 4 cases of CoNS infection were found, 3 and one of which were associated with catheter tip colonisation and wound infection, respectively. In three cases, Staphylococcus closest to S. warneri was identified as a coloniser, and in one case, Staphylococcus closest to S: capitis was identified. Although this particular case was not considered an HAI because the patient did not present with signs of infection and given that Kocuria has been related to catheter-associated BSIs, the opportune detection of catheter colonisation by this bacterium is important for preventing the development of bacteraemia. The clinical significance of species other than S. epidermidis has been increasingly recognised in recent years; however, these species are rarely isolated. Nevertheless, S. capitis was detected in a <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> sample from a patient with an HAI. Given the ability of Staphylococcus closest to S. capitis to establish wound infections (associated biofilm-embedded bacteria) and because all clinical criteria were present in the infected patient, it is clear that this species was an aetiological agent of the infection, thereby indicating an HAI (Senger et al. 2007). On the other hand, Staphylococcus closest to S. warneri was isolated from catheter tips of patients with underlying immunosuppressive conditions, although peripheral blood cultures were not positive; in these cases, this bacterium was considered as having colonised the catheter or tip.|$|E

The mutations occurred in either of the QS genes are associated with low virulence and a poor infective potential. The {{purpose of this study}} was to perform the molecular characterization of QS systems and of eleven extracellular virulence factors, whose expression is regulated by QS systems, in 49 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from respiratory tract <b>secretions</b> and <b>wound</b> <b>secretions</b> samples from patients with cardiovascular surgery associated infections in order to establish the correlations between certain virulence patterns and the clinical origin of bacterial strains. The results of this study showed that all analyzed strains possess QS genes, and five of eleven virulence genes regulated by QS systems. The protease IV and ExoU genes were specifically associated with the origin of the clinical strains, proving that these virulence genes could represent useful diagnosis markers for differentiating clinical P. aeruginosa strains...|$|R
40|$|Water-filtered {{infrared}} A (wIRA), {{a special}} form of heat radiation {{with a high}} tissue penetration and with a low thermal load to the skin surface, is able, through thermal and non-thermal effects, to essentially improve even energetically specific factors of the wound healing. This has been proven by measurements. wIRA can considerably alleviate the pain and accelerate the wound healing or improve a stagnating wound healing and diminish an elevated <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> and inflammation both in acute wounds (prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blinded studies of the Surgical University Hospital Heidelberg after abdominal surgery, n= 94, and of the Children Surgical Department Kassel in severely burned children, n= 45) and in chronic wounds and in problem wounds (prospective, randomised, controlled study in Basel, n= 40, and prospective study of the University Tromsø/Norway in Hillerød/Denmark with effortful thermographic follow-up, n= 10, in both studies chronic venous lower leg ulcers) including infected wounds. A positive influence on the wound healing is particularly possible even without a disturbance of wound healing. In chronic wounds complete healings are achieved, which were not seen before. wIRA is contact-free, easily applied, without discomfort for the patient, with absent consumption of material and with a good effect in the depth, which {{is equivalent to the}} sun heat radiation on the earth in moderate climatic zones. The irradiation of the uncovered wound is carried out typically from a distance of approximately 25 cm with a wIRA radiator. Wound healing and resistance to infection (e. g. granulocyte function including antibacterial oxygen radical formation of the granulocytes) depend decisively on a sufficient energy supply (and on sufficient oxygen). The clinically good effect of wIRA on wounds and also on problem wounds and wound infections {{can be explained by the}} improvement of both the energy supply per time (increase of metabolic rate) and the oxygen supply (e. g. for the granulocyte function). Because of a thermal effect on the tissue wIRA causes an improvement in all three decisive factors oxygen partial pressure, tissue temperature and tissue blood flow. In addition there are also non-thermal effects of infrared A in the sense of a direct stimulation of cells and cellular structures with reactions of the cells...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} the prevalence and {{risk factors of}} post-traumatic sepsis, and to evaluate the rationality of the 1992, 2001 and 2012 international sepsis definitions in diagnosing post-traumatic sepsis in a trauma intensive care unit (ICU) in China. Methods 　A one-day cross-sectional survey of trauma patients who met the inclusion criteria was conducted from 8 : 00 a. m., June 16, 2014 to 8 : 00 a. m., June 17, 2014 in the trauma ICU of Daping Hospital. The survey data included demographic information, clinical characteristics, pertinent scores (APACHE Ⅱ, SOFA, GCS, ISS) and injury mechanism. According {{to the definition of}} sepsis as depicted in the 1992, 2001, and 2012 "International Guideline of Sepsis", the patients were divided into A, B and C groups. The infection site, infection pathogens, and key medical treatment were recorded, the infection identified, and the 28 day mortality recorded. A positive pathogen culture of respiratory and urinary tracts, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> was adopted as the diagnostic "gold standard" for septic infection. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the three versions of the guidelines were statistically analyzed and the diagnostic feasibility of each definition was assessed. Results 　A total of 30 trauma patients were enrolled, twenty-three patients met the 1992 sepsis criteria, 22 met the 2001 criteria, and 20 met the 2012 criteria. The prevalence rates were 76. 7 %, 73. 3 %, and 66. 7 %, respectively, and there was no significant statistical difference. Four patients died within 28 days, which was in line with the diagnostic criteria of the three versions of the sepsis criteria. The 28 -day mortality in the three sepsis guidelines groups was 17. 4 %, 18. 2 %, and 25. 0 %, respectively, indicating no statistical difference. By adopting culture-positive pathogens as the "gold standard" of septic infection, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the group A was 77. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, that of the group B, 82. 2 % and 41. 7 %, respectively, and that of the group C, 72. 2 % and 41. 7 %, respectively. No statistical difference was found in diagnostic performance among the three versions of sepsis criteria. Conclusion 　The prevalence of sepsis is high in the ICU trauma patients. There is no difference in diagnostic performance for post-traumatic sepsis among the three versions of the diagnostic criteria. The 1992 international sepsis criteria is relatively simple and may be more feasible for the diagnosis of post-traumatic sepsis. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2016. 04. 0...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage {{migration}} inhibitory factor (MIF) is versatile cytokine with pleiotropic effects. It promotes chemotaxis, neovascularization, {{proliferation of}} certain cell types {{and the release}} of several cytokines as well as influencing the apoptosis cascade. However, its role in wound repair remains unclear: Some studies found that MIF has beneficial effects on wound healing, other groups observed the opposite. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain new insights into the role of MIF in wound repair by measuring MIF concentrations in patients with acute and chronic wounds. Serum and wound secretions were collected in each group and allowed the comparison of systemic and local MIF concentrations. Cortisol as a key antagonist of MIF and other important parameters were measured additionally. A chemotaxis assay with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was adapted to functionally emphasize the potential role of MIF in wound revascularization. Serum levels of MIF were significantly higher in chronic wound patients than in acute wound patients whereas MIF content was similar in wound secretions in both groups at the same timepoint. This suggests a negative systemic effect of MIF on wound repair as increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are presumed to indicate a shift from the inflammatory phase of wound healing to a chronic phase of stagnation. An ongoing inflammatory activity was reflected by an increase of the systemic inflammation parameter C- reactive protein (CRP) in patients with chronic wounds from to match the higher MIF concentrations there. An increased leukocyte count in serum as a typical acute response to inflammation was not observed. MIF serum levels were slightly higher in male patients than in female individuals as confirmed in other studies. The consideration of other factors such as comorbidities (e. g. diabetes mellitus) or the wound type provided inconclusive results. Local cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in chronic wounds, which is consistent with delayed wound healing. A much stronger chemotactic effect on EPCs was found in sera of acute wound patients, which is presumable due to MIF. However, the influence of other chemotactic factors cannot be excluded. The chemotactic effect was significantly lower in secretions of acute wounds than in chronic wounds, but only partly due to MIF. This work supports the theory that systemic MIF levels have a potential effect on wound repair. At the same time, the impact of local MIF levels remains unclear as other cytokines play a crucial role in wound healing as well. Therefore new techniques to analyze <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> and the interaction of MIF with other cytokines are required and could provide further insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic wounds...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on {{the study}} of the antagonistic effect of aerococcus autosymbionts in experimental models of infections caused by staphylococci. To study the antagonistic action of aerococcus autosymbiont on staphylococcus, a model of chronic staphylococcal infection in white mice and rabbits was used. In staphylococcal experimental infection, aerococcus antagonistic action against staphylococcus was tested by subcutaneous injection on white mice. Aerococci survival under the skin was studied. Aerococcus autosymbionts introduced under the skin to staphylococcus in 5 hours and 3 hours after administration of the latter cause antagonist effect and inhibit the development of infiltrates. Similar results were obtained when introducing aerococcus autosymbionts in the focus of infection in 5 minutes, 5 minutes and 3 hours, 1 and 5 hours after infection. Aerococci introduced after 24 and 48 hours shortened terms of disease manifestations as compared to the control group of mice. The therapeutic effect of aerococcus autosymbionts was tested on the experimental model of burns and wounds infected with staphylococcus. In animals with wounds treated with aerococcus autostrains the number of pathogenic staphylococci was 10 times less than in the control group. According to our observations aerococcus autosymbionts showed no irritant effect when applied on the wound surface, helped its healing, sharply reduced the percentage of staphylococcus inoculation from <b>wound</b> <b>secretions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Corneal {{scarring}} limits {{vision for}} millions of individuals worldwide. Corneal transplantation (keratoplasty) is the standard of care for corneal opacity; however, it bears the risk of graft rejection and infection and is not universally available. Stem cell therapy holds promise {{as an alternative to}} keratoplasty. Stem cells from human corneal stroma (CSSC) induce regeneration of transparent corneal tissue in a mouse wound-healing model. In this study we investigated the mechanism by which CSSC prevent deposition of fibrotic tissue. Infiltration by CD 11 b+/Ly 6 G+ neutrophils and myeloperoxidase expression were increased in corneas 24 hr after corneal wounding but were reduced in CSSC-treated <b>wounds.</b> <b>Secretion</b> of TSG- 6, a protein known to regulate neutrophil migration, was up-regulated in CSSC in response to TNFα and as CSSC differentiate to keratocytes. In vivo, wounded mouse corneas treated with CSSC contained human TSG- 6. Inhibition of neutrophil infiltration into cornea by CSSC was reversed when TSG- 6 expression was knocked down using siRNA. Silencing of TSG- 6 expression in CSSC reduced their ability to block scarring and the expression of mRNA for fibrosis-associated proteins collagen III, tenascin C, and smooth muscle actin in wounded corneas. Neutropenic mice exhibited a significant reduction in corneal scarring and fibrotic mRNA expression 2 weeks after wounding. These results support the conclusion that neutrophil infiltration is an essential event in the fibrotic response to corneal damage and that prevention of scarring by CSSC is mediated by secretion of TSG- 6 by these cells...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis focuses {{in nursing}} {{care of a}} patient with ulcus cruris. Varicose ulcer is a chronic skin defect localized on lower limbs. Its occurrence is most often linked to a venous and arterial system disease. Number of patients with this disease has been growing in recent years. The increasing population age is probably the reason {{as it is known}} that the disease usually affects individuals over 70 years of age (Pospíšilová, 2004). This fact surely increases growing demands to nursing care, particularly the spheres typical for this diagnosis. The most frequently mentioned problems became the ground of the thesis goals. It is divided into two parts: theoretical and practical. The theoretical part explains the basic issues of the disease. With regard to the urgency of the topic the research part was focused on specific nursing care and related nursing care problems in patients with ulcus cruris. Two goals were set with regard the topic and the intended direction where the thesis might have been oriented. The first goal was to map the specifics of nursing care of patients with ulcus cruris and {{to find out what the}} most frequent problems occurring in these patients were. Three research questions were based upon the goals prepared this way. Replies to these questions were obtained upon qualitative data collection performed from February to March 2013 in the České Budějovice Hospital. The selection of respondents was intentional. The research sample consisted of 7 respondents selected from among hospitalized patients and 7 respondents selected from among nurses. Two anonymous semi-structured interviews were prepared for the research purposes, one for the selected patients being treated for this disease and the other for the selected nurses caring about patients with this disease. The first research question dealt with the nursing care specifics. The research itself has shown that the care about the defect itself, which is based on the redressing method, is the basic specific. This has to be performed under strict aseptic conditions to prevent introduction of microorganism into the wound. Removal of residues of ointments and old skin and consequent application of new healing materials are the basic point of this intervention. The research has shown that all these materials have to be applied directly to the defect itself, not to its surrounding. Non-adherence to this would cause aggravation of the wound conditions. Care about pain, which has proven to be the most frequent nursing care problem in these patients during the research, relates to the redressing. The second research question was aimed at the most frequently occurring nursing care problems. The fact that also <b>wound</b> <b>secretion</b> and odour bother the patients apart from the pain was found. These nursing care problems lead to another problem of high importance, which is social isolation. The patients cannot or do not want to socialize and shut themselves away from the world because of the disease. In some instances ties with families are reduced or even completely broken. And so individuals inflicted this way depend on the care of homecare agency nurses or practitioners and dermatologists. In the worst instances they have to rely on themselves. In such an instance the mentality gets disturbed, which is adversely reflected in somatic condition of the individual. A reply to the third research question, i. e. mapping the issues of nursing care nurses have to deal with most frequently results from the care specifics and the most frequent nursing care problems. These issues are redressing of defects, care about pain, education of patients, nourishment care and hygiene. An information brochure, which should serve particularly to the patients suffering from this disease, was prepared upon the results of the thesis...|$|E

40|$|Diagnosis and {{follow-up}} of skull infections are usually performed by neurologic examination, laboratory tests and instrumental diagnostic {{methods such as}} computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These have, however, shown some limitations for specificity. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the overall contribution of Tc- 99 m exametazime-labeled leukocyte imaging scan Tc- 99 m hexamethylpropyleneamine (HMPAO) labeled white blood cells (WBC) in the diagnosis and management of infections in skull neurosurgery. Thirty-four patients were subdivided into 4 groups {{on the basis of the}} suspected pathology: intracerebral lesions on CT or MRI (group A, n 20), suspected postsurgical infections (group B, n 6), suspected deep infection of the surgical wound (group C, n 4), and suspected infection of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (group D, n 4). All patients underwent CT, MRI, and Tc- 99 m HMPAO WBC imaging. Patients in group C also underwent bacteriologic and culture examinations of <b>wound</b> <b>secretions</b> if present. In positive cases in group A, Tc- 99 m HMPAO WBC imaging was repeated. The scintigraphic results were compared with histologic findings in patients who underwent surgery and with the results of a 12 -month clinical follow-up in the remaining patients. Tc- 99 m HMPAO WBC scans correctly detected the infections in all groups. Furthermore, such imaging proved to be able to document recovery from the disease in all of the assessed cerebral abscesses. This study may have an important role both in the diagnosis and in the management of infections in skull neurosurgery, which, it is hoped, will be confirmed in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of Suyuping {{combined}} with semiconductor laser irradiation on the wound healing after anal fistula surgery. Methods: A total of 180 patients with anal fistula who were admitted in our hospital from October, 2013 to May, 2015 for surgery {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the treatment group and the control group with 90 cases in each group. The patients in the control group were given the conventional surgical debridement dressing, a time a day. On this basis, the patients in the treatment group were given Suyuping smearing on the wound sinus tract combined with semiconductor laser irradiation, a time a day for 10 min, continuous irradiation until wound healing. The postoperative wound swelling fading, <b>wound</b> surface <b>secretion</b> amount, and the clinical efficacy in the two groups were recorded. Results: The wound surface swelling degree and wound pain degree at each timing point after operation in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). The wound surface area at each timing point after operation in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). The <b>wound</b> surface <b>secretion</b> amount 6, 9, and 12 days after operation in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P< 0. 05).
