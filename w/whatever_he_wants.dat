5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other way he could win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E
25|$|The Captain {{wanted to}} descend to 2,000ft, but the First Officer {{reminded}} him that the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) was 2,500ft, indicating the possible intentions of the Captain. However, later on, the plane descended through 2,300ft, thus violating the MDA of 2.500ft. After break-off from ILS approach, the Captain ignored the tower controller’s suggestion to fly a bad weather circuit by saying “let him say <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to say”. The CVR recording and flight simulation show that the Captain probably decided to fly a managed approach, unbeknownst to the ATS.|$|E

25|$|A gate to Earth is opened, which Kyle passes through, {{causing the}} Kha'ak to {{discover}} it. They {{try to go}} through it and fight a combined Teladi, Boron and Argon fleet led by Ban Danna, inflicting large casualties. Julian and Ion try to stabilise the gate with the Teladi station, which sends them both through it, killing Ion. Julian survives and finds himself floating at a gate near Earth, with a massive fleet moving towards him. It is the Terran fleet, and with Kyle and Julian on board it passes through the jump hole and helps the overwhelmed defenders against the Kha'ak. The Terrans afterwards distrust towards the X Universe races, even the Argon humans, prompting Kyle to return to Earth to try to correct the situation. Julian is released, pardoned of his crimes by the Argon Federation and the Paranid Empire, and the player is left to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> in the post-plot universe.|$|E
500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And I have my own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|During his arraignment, Modell {{uses his}} ability to make the judge let him go. The agents look into Modell's past and find that he failed to enter the FBI after a {{psychological}} examination deemed him to be grossly egocentric and sociopathic. Meanwhile, after writing the word [...] "pass" [...] {{on a piece of}} paper and putting it in his shirt pocket, Modell is able to pass security and enter FBI headquarters. He [...] "pushes" [...] an agent, Holly (Julia Arkos), into pulling up Mulder's file for him. When Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) intervenes, Modell convinces Holly that he was a man who mugged her, causing her to spray Skinner with mace and beat him. Scully is unable to explain how Modell has his power, but now agrees with Mulder's theory that he can push people into doing <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} resist an innate desire to do some just thing on this most {{deceitful}} and wretched day of her life. Going up to him she gave him money, {{and told him to}} send to the old manor-house for wine or <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Catchum Crocodile (voiced by Timothy Gibbs) - The show's main antagonist.

60|$|And now Tobey came in, driving {{before him}} a lot of Mexicans bearing trays of food. The long table was laid in a moment, for {{everything}} was dumped upon it without any attempt at order.

500|$|Wood and Weiss {{argue over}} the film's title and subject matter: Weiss has the poster printed, which Wood changes to Glen or Glenda and writes the {{film about a}} {{transvestite}} rather than a sex change. Weiss allows Wood to shoot <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{as long as the}} film meets the required length. [...] Wood takes to film production with an unusual approach; shooting only one take per scene, giving actors very little direction and using stock footage to fill in gaps. [...] The movie is released to critical and commercial failure. Because of this, Wood is unsuccessful in getting a job at Screen Classics, but his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller, tells him that he should try financing his next film independently. Wood is unsuccessful in finding money for Bride of the Atom, but is introduced to the psychic The Amazing Criswell who gives him advice on how to sell himself better.|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> without any backlash.|$|E
500|$|When Monkey Punch began Lupin III, he {{was already}} working on another series, Pinky Punky. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both Lupin III and Pinky Punky made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this {{made it easy for}} him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as Columbo and Agatha Christie novels, and was also {{inspired}} by The Three Musketeers and the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and describes them as [...] "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other". Another influence on the manga was Mad magazine. Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.|$|E
50|$|Nu-An later welcomed a 10-Year-Old Danny Rand to K'un-L'un {{granting}} him {{a rewarding}} stay and expressed his grief over Danny's parents. When Nu-An told Danny that <b>he</b> can have <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> Danny told Nu-An that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> revenge. Nu-An told Danny that revenge {{is the one}} thing he can't give to Danny. He did offer to have Danny trained in the arts of Kung Fu.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, that is {{the kind}} of a man Lyte Gregory was. He was of a {{different}} race from ordinary, ailing mortals. He was a lordly being, untouched by common ills and misfortunes. <b>Whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>he</b> got. He won his wife--one of the Caruthers, a little beauty--from a dozen rivals. And she settled down and made him the finest wife in the world. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> a boy. <b>He</b> got it. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> a girl and another boy. He got them. And they were just right, without spot or blemish, with chests like little barrels, and with all the inheritance of his own health and strength.|$|R
2500|$|Jeff Loomis {{commented on}} {{the writing of the}} album: [...] "I think that with the new Nevermore, it still sounds like the band, but I think I'm giving Warrel a little bit more room this time around for more vocals rather than all the notey, kind of complex stuff and all that, so this time around it's {{just a little bit more}} wide open musically for him to really be able to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> vocally this time around. So we'll see what happens. It's gonna be an {{interesting}} album for us, for sure." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{prominent}} culture hero {{for many of}} the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest is Raven. [...] There are numerous stories, widely distributed which focus on the Raven myth and his adventures to satisfy his insatiable desire to obtain <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> [...] The plot of most Raven tales, tell of how Raven is able to use force or trickery to obtain or motivate someone else to relinquish an object he desires. [...] Throughout his many stories, Raven claims daylight, water, fire, the oceans waves, the olachen, salmon, the soil, and even the weather.|$|E

The following week, he won the PGA Championship at Valhalla for his fourth major, one shot ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson. After his victory Jack Nicklaus said: [...] "Rory is an unbelievable talent. I think Rory {{has an opportunity to}} win 15 or 20 majors or <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do if he wants to keep playing. I love his swing." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Huan Xuan's year at Nan Commandery, {{the people}} of the commandery were far more fearful of him than of the {{governor}} of Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan), Yin Zhongkan (殷仲堪). [...] Yin himself was very respectful and fearful of Huan as well. [...] Effectively, Huan Xuan got his way with both the people and the governor, <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b>|$|R
25|$|Peru {{went through}} to the quarterfinals with 7 points. Manco would shine the most against Tajikistan, where he did pretty much <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> against the Tajikistan defence on the flanks, and scored Peru's only goal, and his first and only goal in the World Cup. The game ended 1–1, with Peru winning 5–4 in the penalty shootout after Peruvian goalkeeper Hermoza saved the first penalty.|$|R
5000|$|Bolaño had {{conflicted}} {{feelings about}} his native country. He was notorious in Chile for his fierce attacks on Isabel Allende {{and other members}} of the literary establishment.

Paul said that [...] "what he should do is <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do, and assume responsibility for himself." [...] When asked specifically whether the man should just be left to die, Paul then replied that he should not be left to die, but should be able to rely on the kindness of neighbors, friends, churches, and charities, as would have occurred back when Paul worked in a church charity hospital early in his career, at a time when healthcare paid for by the government was not available.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Burns' {{trademark}} {{expression is}} the word [...] "", muttered slowly in a low, sinister voice while steepling his fingertips. He occasionally orders Smithers to [...] "release the hounds", so as to let his vicious guard dogs attack any intruders, enemies or even invited guests. Mr. Burns is Springfield's richest and most powerful citizen (and also the richest person in Springfield's state; his current net worth has been given as $7.3billion by Forbes, though it fluctuates wildly depending on the episode). He uses his power and wealth to do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> usually without regard for consequences and without interference from the authorities. These qualities led Wizard Magazine to rate him the 45th greatest villain of all time. TV Guide named him #2 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him #8 of their [...] "40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time".|$|E
2500|$|... The poem {{opens with}} the poet's {{invocation}} of the muses, his address to Proteus, and {{his commitment to}} sing the various episodes of Dionysus' life in a varied style (stylistic concept of ( [...] poikilia). The narrative starts with the origins of Dionysus: Zeus kidnaps Europa and her father orders Cadmus (Dionysus' maternal grandfather) to search for her. While Zeus is distracted making love to the nymph Plouto, the monster Typhon, following orders of his mother, the Earth, steals Zeus' weapons (the thunderbolts) and tries to dominate the world causing chaos and destruction wherever he goes. Zeus is now making love to Europa, but when he realises the dire situation calls Pan, Eros and Cadmus for help: Pan provides Cadmus with a pastoral disguise and {{he is supposed to}} charm Typhon with a pastoral song and Eros' help, while Zeus recovers his weapons. Typhon is so charmed by Cadmus' song that he promises him <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> in exchange for it, not understanding that Cadmus is actually singing how he is defeated by Zeus.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Boogie Nights, New Line told Anderson that <b>he</b> could do <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> for his next film and granted him {{creative}} control.

The resulting film was the ensemble piece Magnolia (1999), which {{tells the story of the}} peculiar interaction of several individuals in the San Fernando Valley.|$|R
5000|$|Matsukata {{was well}} known as {{a good friend of}} Claude Monet.

Fortunately, the exact colour is not material, for the natives are any shade between yellow and black." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How d'ye do, my darter? is {{your daddy}} at home?" [...] "My darter" [...] usually makes off {{as fast as}} possible, in an unconquerable giggle. Father Morris goes into the house, and we watch him at every turn, as, with the most liberal simplicity, he makes himself at home, takes off his wig, wipes down his great face with a checked pocket handkerchief, helps himself hither and thither to <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants,</b> and asks {{for such things as}} he cannot lay his hands on, with all the {{comfortable}} easiness of childhood.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier on (before the divorce) he {{made this}} stupid attempt to get Northrup brainwashed so she'd do what he said. He kept her sitting up in a chair, denying her sleep, trying to use Black Dianetic {{principles}} on her, repeating {{over and over again}} <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> her to do. Things like, [...] "Be his wife, have a family that looks good, not have a divorce." [...] Or <b>whatever.</b> <b>He</b> had Dick de Mille reciting this sort of thing day and night to her.|$|R

There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, {{grinning}} face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. <b>Whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>he</b> must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.|$|R
