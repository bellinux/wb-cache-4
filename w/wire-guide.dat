40|$|BACKGROUND: The wire-guided {{excision}} of nonpalpable breast cancer {{often results in}} tumor resections with inadequate margins. This prospective, randomized trial was undertaken to investigate whether intraoperative ultrasound (US) guidance enables a better margin clearance than the wire-guided technique in the breast-conserving treatment of nonpalpable breast cancers. METHODS: Patients with a preoperative histological diagnosis of nonpalpable breast cancer that could be visualized both with US and mammography were included. Patients were randomized to undergo either a wire-guided or a US-guided excision. Adequate margins were defined as >/= 1 mm. RESULTS: Of 49 included patients, 23 were assigned to undergo wire-guided excision and 26 to undergo US-guided excision. One patient crossed over to US-guided excision after inadvertent wire displacement. Mean tumor diameter, specimen weight, and operating time were similar in both groups. The excision was adequate in 24 (89 %) of 27 US-guided excisions and 12 (55 %) of 22 <b>wire-guide</b> excisions (P =. 007). CONCLUSIONS: US-guided excision seems to be superior to wire-guided excision with respect to margin clearance of mammographically detected and US-visible nonpalpable breast cancers. Patients {{do not have to}} undergo the unpleasant wire placement before surgery...|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} offer {{quick access}} to information for healthcare decision-making towards personalized therapeutics, but complicated procedures requiring extensive labor and infrastructure restrict their use. Droplet-based technologies can expand the accessibility of molecular diagnostics by miniaturizing devices, shortening sample-to-answer times, decreasing costs and increasing throughput. Methods for droplet manipulation {{are central to the}} automation of molecular diagnostics protocols. The innovative method, wire-guided droplet manipulation (WDM), is the actuation of liquid droplets in a hydrophobic milieu with a wire, or needle, guide. In this work, WDM is demonstrated for the automation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on reprogrammable platforms for the diagnosis of cardiovascular infections. WDM is used to minimize thermal resistance by convective heat transfer for PCR amplification at a maximum speed of 8. 67 s/cycle. The oil-water interfacial boundary is shown to passively partition molecular contaminants from sample matrices, including blood and heart valve tissue. Molecular self-assembly at the oil-water interface is used to increase PCR efficiency with blood in situ and is used as an innovative sensing modality for real-time monitoring of PCR amplification. Temperature feedback controlled droplet actuation is achieved by using a thermocouple loop as a functionalized <b>wire-guide.</b> Our novel methodology for real-time PCR, droplet-on-thermocouple silhouette real-time PCR (DOTS qPCR), utilizes interfacial effects to achieve droplet actuation, relief from PCR inhibitors and amplification sensing, for a sample-to-answer time as short as 3 min 30 s. DOTS qPCR addresses three major issues for rapid PCR—sample preparation, rapid thermocycling and sensitive real-time detection—on an inexpensive, disposable device with smartphone-based detection. In contrast, commercially available real-time PCR systems rely on fluorescence detection, have substantially higher threshold cycles, and require expensive optical components and extensive sample preparation. Due to the advantages of low threshold cycle detection we anticipate extending this technology towards trending biological research applications such as single cell, single nucleus, and single DNA molecule analyses, especially in droplet microfluidic platforms...|$|E

40|$|In a {{randomised}} crossover trial, {{we compared}} a <b>wire-guided</b> cricothyrotomy technique (Minitrach) with a catheter-over-needle technique (Quicktrach). Performance time, ease of method, accuracy in placement and complication rate were compared. Ten anaesthesiology and 10 ENT residents performed cricothyrotomies with both techniques on prepared pig larynxes. The catheter-over-needle technique was {{faster than the}} <b>wire-guided</b> (48 compared to 150 s, p < 0. 001) and subjectively easier to perform (VAS-score 2. 1 vs. 5. 6, p < 0. 001). Correct positioning of the cannula could be achieved in 95 % and 85 %, respectively (NS). There was one complication in the catheter-over-needle group compared to five in the <b>wire-guided</b> group. We conclude that the <b>wire-guided</b> minitracheotomy kit is unsuitable for emergency cricothyrotomies performed by inexperienced practitioners. On the other hand, the catheter-over-needle technique appears to be quick, safe and reliable...|$|R

40|$|AIM: This {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical study}} was conducted to compare radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) with <b>wire-guided</b> localization to evaluate optimum localization techniques for non-palpable breast lesions. METHODS: A total of 108 patients who were undergoing an excisional biopsy for non-palpable breast lesions requiring pathologic diagnosis were randomly assigned to the ROLL group (n = 56) and <b>wire-guided</b> localization group (n = 52). In the study, patients' characteristics, radiological abnormalities, radiological technique of localization, localization time, operation time, weight of the excised specimen, clearance margins, pathological diagnosis and perioperative complications were assessed. RESULTS: There were no {{differences between the two groups}} in terms of age, radiological abnormalities and localization technique (p = non-significant for all). ROLL techniques resulted in 100 % retrieval of the lesions; for the <b>wire-guided</b> localization technique, 98 %. Both localization time and operation time were significantly reduced with the ROLL technique (p = significant for all). The weight of the specimen was significantly lower in the ROLL group than in the <b>wire-guided</b> localization group (p = significant). The overall complication rate and pathological diagnosis were similar for both groups (p = non-significant for all). Clear margins were achieved in 91 % of ROLL patients and in 53 % of <b>wire-guided</b> localization patients, and the difference was significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that the ROLL technique is as effective as <b>wire-guided</b> localization for the excision of non-palpable breast lesions. In addition, ROLL improved the outcomes by reducing localization and operation time, preventing healthy tissue excision and achieving clearer margins...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: This {{retrospective}} study compared {{the effectiveness of}} the timing of the antibiotic locks to clear catheter-related bacteremia in children on chronic hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The early antibiotic lock group received antibiotic locks along with systemic antibiotics {{from the very beginning of}} catheter-related bacteremia. The late antibiotic lock group was given only systemic antibiotics initially, and antibiotic locks were used late in the infection if the catheter-related bacteremia could not be cleared after resolution of symptoms. Results: There were 264 catheter-related bacteremias in 79 children during 6 yr of observation. Early antibiotic locks were able to clear catheter-related bacteremia and resolve the symptoms more effectively without the need for catheter exchange when compared with late antibiotic locks. A total of 84 catheter-related bacteremias required <b>wire-guided</b> exchange of the catheters. Late antibiotic locks required <b>wire-guided</b> catheter exchange more frequently than the early antibiotic locks. The post–catheter-related bacteremia infection–free survival of the catheters after <b>wire-guided</b> exchange were significantly longer than those of both antibiotic lock groups. Recurrence of catheter-related bacteremia within 45 d after <b>wire-guided</b> exchange occurred at similar rates compared with the antibiotic lock groups. Conclusion: Antibiotic locks are significantly more effective in clearing catheter-related bacteremia when used early in infection, diminishing the need for catheter exchange. <b>Wire-guided</b> exchange has a late-onset advantage for infection-fre...|$|R
