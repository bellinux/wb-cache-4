5|$|On February 12, 2000, he {{defeated}} Jan Piet Bergman to win {{the vacant}} IBF Light Welterweight title. Bergman went down twice in the first round, but recovered in the second round, knocking Judah down. Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round {{to win the}} title. On June 20, 2000, Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow, Scotland. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> fight for Judah, as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches. Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed, making him an elusive opponent. Judah's consistent body punching slowed Witter down, and in the fifth round, Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring. Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision.|$|E

Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> scandal that revolved around his mistress, Maria Catargiu-Obrenović, and popular discontent culminated in a coup d'état.|$|E

25|$|In school, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward,</b> talkative {{youth and}} was elected {{president}} of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School, where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball. At age 15, Johnson was the youngest member of his class and {{is believed to have been}} the youngest graduate of the school. In the months following his graduation, Johnson moved to California amid pressure by his parents to go to college. Johnson supported himself by picking grapes. He enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to SWTSTC at San Marcos. Johnson later said that he was kicked out of the school.|$|E
25|$|Madame de Saint Georges died in 1643 and Mademoiselle's father chose Madame de Fiesque to {{take her}} place.

Her uncle also died in May 1643, leaving Louis XIV as King of France. Louis XIII, prior to death, had accepted his brother's plea for forgiveness and authorised his marriage to Marguerite of Lorraine, whereupon the couple undertook nuptials {{for the third time in}} July 1643 before the Archbishop of Paris at Meudon, and the Duke and Duchess of Orléans were finally received at court.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{began its}} {{life as a}} 20,000-word novella, which was prize-winning in its own right. As it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> length for a novel, {{publishers}} requested that Anderson extend the story, which she did following a trip to London in 1974. In 1975 Tirra Lirra was broadcast as a radio play, and in 1977 Macmillan Publishers in Melbourne accepted it for publishing. In the year of its publication, Tirra Lirra won the Australian Natives' Association Literary Award, and the Miles Franklin Literary Award, Australia's most prestigious literary award. Anderson attributed its tremendous success in some degree {{to the fact that}} [...] "it is less complex, I think. It's easier to read than most of my others." ...|$|E

500|$|Khan's only {{release in}} 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture, the drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him {{once again in}} a romantic role, {{starring}} opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to {{have been one of}} his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> one. Jab Tak Hai Jaan [...] was a moderate financial success earning over [...] worldwide. The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2. At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.|$|E
500|$|In March 1843, Verdi visited Vienna (where Gaetano Donizetti was musical director) {{to oversee}} a {{production}} of Nabucco. The older composer, recognising Verdi's talent, noted in a letter of January 1844: [...] "I am very, very happy {{to give way to}} people of talent like Verdi... Nothing will prevent the good Verdi from soon reaching one of the most honourable positions in the cohort of composers." [...] Verdi travelled on to Parma, where the Teatro Regio di Parma was producing Nabucco with Strepponi in the cast. For Verdi the performances were a personal triumph in his native region, especially as his father, Carlo, attended the first performance. Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date. This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Verdi's interest in Giuseppina Strepponi (who stated that their relationship began in 1843). Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships (and many illegitimate children) and her history <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

500|$|At the Conference of State Metternich {{lost his}} {{principal}} ally Karel Clam-Martinic in 1840, which furthered the growing paralysis {{at the heart}} of Austrian government. Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. Fortunately there were no major challenges to the regime from outside. Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich's attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845 the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already in a bad mood, he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence from Kraków. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an action of dubious utility: not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the [...] "Metternich system" [...] that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich's resignation were ignored. For the next two years Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold government together.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her studies}} at Harvard, Nussbaum claims she {{encountered}} {{a tremendous amount}} of discrimination, including sexual harassment, and problems getting childcare for her daughter. When she became the first woman to hold the Junior Fellowship at Harvard, Nussbaum received a congratulatory note from a [...] "prestigious classicist" [...] who suggested that since [...] "female fellowess" [...] <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> name, she should be called hetaira, for in Greece these educated courtesans were the only women who participated in philosophical symposia.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{weakness}} {{that could}} be seen in the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Bill Brown (46.82) had all retired and had not been fully replaced. The vice-captain Arthur Morris (46.48) was labeled [...] "Bedser's Bunny" [...] as the English bowler dismissed him easily in the first three Tests, but he made 168 and 105 against the tourists for New South Wales and 100 for an Australian XI. He finally laid the bunny to rest with his highest Test century in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, making 206 out of 371. The real trouble was finding him a suitable opening partner as Jack Moroney made a pair, Ken Archer never made a Test 50 and Jim Burke failed when promoted after making an unbeaten century on his Test debut. It was a problem that was not solved and Lindsay Hassett took to opening the batting in 1953 and Morris had another succession of partners in 1954-55. Neil Harvey (48.42) was still a baby-faced youngster in 1950-51, committed to strokeplay regardless of the situation. He had a steady series and initially came in at number 3 before being moved down to his natural position at number 4. Lindsay Hassett replaced him and the Australian captain made more runs than anybody else in the team, but failed to make a century. However, he did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, Miller topped the Australian batting averages and was the only man who could - briefly - take the attack to the accurate bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. Sam Loxton (36.93) was a big-hitting all-rounder, but his bowling days were behind him and was used as a middle order batsmen, without success. Ian Johnson was a useful tailender who could have been a fully-fledged all rounder with greater application and made 77 in the Third Test at Sydney. Don Tallon was a useful lower-order batsmen in 1948, but failed in all the Tests and his increasing deafness made him a poor runner. Bill Johnston <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awkward</b> batsmen who could be difficult to remove, but the last man was Jack Iverson [...] "...whose batting pretensions are possibly no higher than those of a third-grade schoolboy player".|$|E
