40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} active versus passive warnings at uncontrolled pedestrian (ped) crosswalks (Xwalks), by comparing how these two <b>warnings</b> <b>types</b> influenced behavior of drivers approaching such Xwalks. Vehicle-Xwalk interactions were observed at 18 sites with passive, continuously flashing, or ped-activated warnings, yielding 7, 305 no ped present and 596 ped present interactions. Vehicle velocities and accelerations were averaged for each interaction. Findings show no significant effect of <b>warning</b> <b>type</b> on overall velocities for either interaction type. With peds present only, for average velocities at successive 5 m distances from the Xwalk, a downward trend in velocities from 25 to 5 m is observed for passive and active warning sites, but not for pedactivated warning sites. Various lines of evidence point {{to a number of}} sources of ambiguity regarding the salience of uncontrolled Xwalk warnings, resulting in behavioral uncertainty by drivers interacting with such warnings. Mixed findings on effects of <b>warning</b> <b>type</b> in this study point to the need for further analysis of this problem area. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R

40|$|The second-class {{formulation}} of generics in Java 5. 0 discards generic type information during compilation. As a result, Java 5. 0 prohibits run-time type-dependent operations, generates unavoidable unchecked <b>warnings</b> (<b>type</b> errors) during compilation, and causes unexpected behavior during execution. The NextGen Generic Java compiler eliminates these pathologies by retaining parametric type information at runtime and customizing the code in generic classes and polymorphic methods where {{necessary to support}} (parametric) type-dependent operations. NextGen is a production compiler for the entire Java 5. 0 language; it executes on standard JVMs and is backward compatible with existing libraries and other binaries. Benchmarks show that the first-class implementation of generic types in NextGen has essentially the same performance as Java 5. 0 and significanlty outperforms alternative first-class implementation architectures...|$|R

40|$|What type {{of support}} {{should be given to}} an {{automobile}} driver when it is determined, via some monitoring method, that the driver’s situation awareness may not be appropriate to a given traffic condition? With a driving simulator, the following three conditions were compared: (a) Warning type support in which an auditory warning is given to the driver to enhance situation awareness, (b) action type support in which an autonomous safety control action is executed to avoid an acci-dent, and (c) the no-aid baseline condition. Although the both types of driver support are effective, the <b>warning</b> <b>type</b> support sometimes fail to assure safety, which suggests a limitation of the human locus of control assumption. Efficacy of the action type support can also be degraded due to a characteristic of human reasoning under uncertainty.

40|$|One unique {{property}} of head-mounted displays (HMDs) is that content {{can easily be}} displayed at a fixed position within the user’s field of view (head-stabilized). This ensures that critical information (e. g. warnings) is continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an initial study, we found no significant effects of <b>warning</b> <b>type</b> or display technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD {{when compared to the}} HUD.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} auditory and vibrotactile forward collision warnings presenting a motion signal (e. g., looming or apparent motion across the body surface) can facilitate speeded braking reaction times (BRTs). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to expand on this work by directly comparing warning signals in which the motion conveyed was constant across all collision events with signals in which the speed of motion was dependent on the closing velocity (CV). Two experiments were conducted using a simulated car-following task and BRTs were measured. In Experiment 1, increasing intensity (looming) vibrotactile signals were presented from a single tactor attached to the driver's waist. When the increase in intensity was CV-linked, BRTs were significantly faster as compared to a no-warning condition, however, they were not significantly different from constant intensity and CV-independent looming warnings. In Experiment 2, a vertical array of three tactors was used to create motion either towards (upwards) or away (downwards) from the driver's head. When the warning signal presented upwards motion that was CV-linked, BRTs were significantly faster than all other <b>warning</b> <b>types.</b> Downwards <b>warnings</b> led to a significantly higher number of brake activations in false alarm situations as compared to upwards moving warnings. The effectiveness of dynamic tactile collision warnings would therefore appear to depend on both the link between the warning and collision event and on the directionality of the warning signal...|$|R
40|$|Speeding {{is still}} a common {{practice}} on many roads and it contributes to {{a significant number of}} crashes. Two new approaches to solve speeding issues are focused on: intelligent speed assistance systems (ISA) and speed limit credibility. Research has indicated that ISA is promising with respect to improving speed behaviour but has not been widely implemented yet. Another promising approach to reduce speeding involves adjusting the environment to improve the speed limit credibility. The aim here is to investigate the potential of both approaches and particularly the potential of the combination of these measures. A driving simulator study was conducted to investigate the individual and combined effects of the use of an ISA system and the speed limit credibility on drivers' average speed and {{the amount of time spent}} speeding. The results indicated that both the informative ISA system used here and the speed limit credibility significantly improved speed behaviour. Drivers not using ISA appeared to be more susceptible to the speed limit credibility than those using ISA. It is concluded that both the measures can be effective to improve speed behaviour. The results obtained suggest that the properties of this particular informing and <b>warning</b> <b>type</b> of ISA could have resulted in the speed limit credibility neither affecting the amount of time speeding nor the average speed.

40|$|In this ViP {{project the}} focus of {{investigation}} was whether drivers more readily accept either rumble strips or an in-vehicle lane departure warning system (LDW) in unintentional lane departure situations. The results show that acceptance was high for both alternatives, but while the drivers showed more satisfaction from using the LDW, they also showed more trust in the rumble strips. Twenty-four drivers drove the VTI driving simulator SIM III in car mode with simulated rumble strips in one drive and with a simulated Volvo LDW in another drive. A forced yaw motion of the vehicle induced the unintentional lane departures. The results showed no choice in favour of the LDW or the rumble strips, but a clear preference for having a function that warns for unintentional lane departure. Several participants thought {{it was good to}} have both <b>types</b> of <b>warning</b> in parallel. Although Response completion time was shorter with the rumble strips warning, {{there was no difference between}} the <b>warning</b> <b>types,</b> neither in Time to get car back in lane nor in Lane exceedence area. Thus, there were no major overall differences between the LDW and the rumble strips as measured in the present study. The conclusion is that the drivers’ acceptance, as well as performance, was high for both the rumble strips and the LDW. The positive opinion on the need for assistance systems in unintentional lane departure when drivers are directing their visual attention away from the road is thus further strengthened...|$|R
