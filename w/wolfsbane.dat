5|$|In 1994, {{the band}} listened to {{hundreds}} of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band <b>Wolfsbane</b> who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them. Harris' preferred choice from the outset, Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. <b>Wolfsbane</b> comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

50|$|After a demo tape {{forwarded}} to Ritchie Blackmore's management {{a few years}} earlier sat in a box for a few years, Candice Night discovered it and presented it to Blackmore when he was looking for singers to audition for Rainbow. Consequently, White was asked to audition for Rainbow, subsequently joining the band in 1994.

50|$|After Havok and Polaris rejoin X-Factor, Theresa {{is present}} when Layla reveals Jamie {{has come back}} from the dead but not by her doing. After {{returning}} from one of X-Factors missions, Theresa and Polaris share concern for <b>Wolfsbane's</b> wellbeing as she barely comes out of her room unless it's for missions. The two women decide to take Rahne on a road trip to Reverend John Maddox to help her. During the trip, Theresa and Lorna bond and develop a friendship.|$|R
50|$|When {{a mysterious}} virus began attacking the genetically {{engineered}} mutate population of Genosha, Moira volunteered her {{services as a}} geneticist {{and was forced to}} watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found Illyana Rasputin suffering from the same illness, later identified as the Legacy Virus. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl’s death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing <b>Wolfsbane's</b> artificial bond with Havok).|$|R
50|$|Guido dies while {{engaged in}} a job to protect J. Jonah Jameson from some {{super-powered}} assassins. He is shot through the heart; however, {{the cause of death}} is from overtaxing his damaged organ by stopping a Mandroid from falling onto a crowd. He is rushed to the hospital, but the doctors are unable to save him due to the damage to his heart. A few minutes later, however, he miraculously revives, showing no injuries. It is revealed that Layla Miller resurrected him; however, as a consequence of this he no longer has a soul. As a result, Guido begins acting more aggressive, and after a frustrating failed date with M, quits the group, only to return during the Hell on Earth War where he works for Mephisto against the other Hell Lords. By the end of the event, he murders <b>Wolfsbane's</b> son Tier in order to become the Supreme Hell Lord.|$|R
25|$|Blob later resurfaces as {{a member}} of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the {{government}} for the loss of their powers, attacking Mutant Town in defiance of the Decimation. After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and <b>Wolfsbane)</b> and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.|$|E
25|$|Several marsh {{complexes}} {{exist in}} the park, but they are generally poor in vegetation, except for certain zones that the diabase rends richer in nutrients. However, along the mountainside streams, a rich carpet of vegetation was able to develop, with in particular alternate-leaved golden-saxifrage, chickweed willowherb, <b>wolfsbane</b> and wood stitchwort. At Njupeskär, conditions are especially favorable {{for the growth of}} wood sorrel, which does not normally grow so far south. These wetlands are also the most interesting areas for mosses and lichens; Fulufjället is one of the richest sites in all Sweden, with 394 species of moss and over 500 species of lichens found. The presence of these lichens is in part {{due to the fact that}} the park is not part of the territory of reindeer pasture.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{discovering}} that Sirius is innocent, {{and that the}} very much alive Pettigrew is the traitor, Professor Lupin helps Sirius explain the truth to Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Shrieking Shack. However, Professor Lupin had forgotten to take the <b>Wolfsbane</b> Potion that night and so, when touched by moonlight, transforms into a werewolf with no control over his actions. Sirius, in dog form, drives Lupin safely away from the others into the Forbidden Forest, where he wakes the next morning restored to his human body and mind. Snape, however, furious over Sirius's eventual escape and his resultant loss of the Order of Merlin promised to him by Cornelius Fudge, publicly reveals the nature of Professor Lupin's lycanthropy. Anticipating a public outcry {{in response to the}} threat he himself agrees he poses to the students, Professor Lupin resigns from his post.|$|E
2500|$|The Wildhearts next {{planned a}} double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the {{recording}} sessions. Instead the band released {{a collection of}} six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track [...] "Geordie In Wonderland". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with <b>Wolfsbane's</b> Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included [...] "If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic [...] "Sky Babies." [...] Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play [...] "Sky Babies" [...] at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.|$|R
25|$|Remus John Lupin, nicknamed Moony, first {{appears in}} Prisoner of Azkaban {{as the new}} Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Most of the {{students}} hold him in extremely high regard and love his hands-on teaching style. During his tenure, he gives Harry private lessons in casting the Patronus Charm, to aid him in fighting off the Dementors patrolling the Hogwarts grounds. It is revealed in the climax of Prisoner of Azkaban that Professor Lupin is a werewolf. He turns into a werewolf at every full moon and only retains his human mind while transformed by drinking the <b>Wolfsbane</b> Potion prepared for him by Snape. Hermione discovers before Harry and Ron that Professor Lupin is a werewolf, after Professor Snape gives Lupin's class an assignment on werewolves. She also notices that Professor Lupin's boggart is a moon.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Snape {{demonstrates}} {{his expertise}} with potions by brewing the complex <b>Wolfsbane</b> potion {{for the new}} Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin. Throughout the third book, Snape suspects that Lupin may be helping Harry's godfather Sirius Black enter Hogwarts castle; Sirius had been convicted (wrongly, as it is later revealed) of murdering Peter Pettigrew and innocent bystanders, and betraying the Potter family's hiding place to Voldemort. This suspicion stems from Lupin's friendship with Sirius and Harry's father, James, while they were all at Hogwarts as students. Near {{the climax of the}} book, Snape attempts to apprehend Sirius, but Sirius escapes with Harry's aid. Snape informs Dumbledore of this circumstance, and when Harry and Lupin are not punished, Snape retaliates by revealing to the entire school that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing the latter to resign his post.|$|E
25|$|In medieval Europe, traditionally, {{there are}} three methods one can use to cure a victim of werewolfism; medicinally (usually via the use of <b>wolfsbane),</b> surgically, or by exorcism. However, many of the cures {{advocated}} by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured {{if one were to}} simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it. Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing werewolfism in the medieval period; a devotion to St. Hubert has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.|$|E
25|$|The BBC novel The Eight Doctors {{was written}} by {{respected}} Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks, the same author who wrote The Five Doctors. In it, he tries to reconcile the continuity errors of the 1996 movie, while having the Eighth Doctor meet and interact with each of his previous selves, although the Eighth Doctor visited each incarnation {{one at a time}} rather than all eight of them appearing in the same place. Later Eighth Doctor novel Interference – Book One sees the Eighth Doctor briefly meeting the Third, although this occasion results in the Doctor unwittingly changing his own history so that the Third Doctor will regenerate ahead of schedule (A change that is later 'reset' in the novel The Ancestor Cell thanks to the TARDIS taking action to preserve the original history). In the Past Doctor Adventures, the novel Heart of TARDIS features the Second and Fourth Doctors dealing with two different ends of the same crisis, with the Second Doctor trapped in a dimensional anomaly created by a government experiment and the Fourth recruited to stop the experiment destroying the world, but although they are at one point both in the Second Doctor's TARDIS, the Fourth Doctor and his companion hide {{on the opposite side of}} the console from his past self and the Second is never aware of his future self. In The Colony of Lies, the Second Doctor briefly interacts with the Seventh Doctor in a VR simulation, but it is unspecified if this is the actual Seventh Doctor or just a VR program he left to advise his past self. In <b>Wolfsbane,</b> like in Heart of TARDIS, the Fourth and Eighth Doctors deal with separate ends of the same crisis, the Eighth stopping the threat in November 1936 while the Fourth ties up loose ends in December of the same year, but the two incarnations never meet directly, and due to the Eighth Doctor's current amnesia none of the other characters realize that the two Doctors are the same person.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the valleys}} {{and on the}} mountainside, in contrast, the diabase and the better weather permit a richer vegetation. In particular, these areas are {{blanketed}} in forest, with the plant species varying with altitude: moor birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce cover , [...] and , respectively. The undergrowth also presents great diversity in plant life. To wit, the south-facing slopes are principally covered in Scots pines and their undergrowth strongly resembles heath, with in particular common heather and crowberry. The rest of the coniferous forests include most often whortleberry, northern oak fern, woundwort, and common cow-wheat. The soil rich in diabase allows the growth of more demanding plants, such as Alpine blue-sow-thistle, wood cranesbill [...] and northern <b>wolfsbane.</b> These zones also have {{a great number of}} species of moss; the park has {{more than a third of}} all the species of moss in the country.|$|E
