500|$|In the Advaita Vedanta of the 8th century Indian philosopher Śaṅkara, the mind, {{body and}} world are all {{held to be}} the same unchanging eternal {{conscious}} entity called Brahman. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute consciousness. The fact that the <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or Maya. The only thing that exists is Brahman, which is described as Satchitananda (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states [...] "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman".|$|E
500|$|Other {{characteristics}} of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details, the dramatic landscape background in which the <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> {{to be in a}} state of flux, the subdued colouring, and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. Vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even [...] "the most confident master... despair and lose heart." [...] The perfect state of preservation and {{the fact that there is}} no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.|$|E

Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> to work. Lori has {{a lot of things going}} on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{philosophy}} {{of mind that}} regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous and thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind. [...] As example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is, [...] "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort." [...] Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one for instance. [...] This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which {{is defined as the}} dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another. [...] Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|On {{a popular}} level, the First Crusade {{unleashed}} {{a wave of}} impassioned, pious Catholic furyexpressed in the massacres of Jews that accompanied the Crusades and the violent treatment of the [...] "schismatic" [...] Orthodox Christians of the east which occurred at Antioch. The Islamic <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> to have barely registered the Crusade; certainly there is limited written evidence before 1130. This may be {{in part due to}} a reluctance to relate Muslim failure, but it {{is more likely to be}} the result of cultural misunderstanding. Al-Afdal and the Muslim world mistook the Crusaders for the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries rather than religiously motivated warriors intent on conquest and settlement. In any case, the Muslim world was divided between the Sunnis of Syria and Iraq and the Shia Fatimids of Egypt. Even the Turks were divided, with rival rulers in Damascus and Aleppo. In Baghdad the Seljuk sultan vied with an Abbasid caliph in a Mesopotamian struggle. This gave the Franks a crucial opportunity to consolidate without any pan-Islamic counterattack.|$|E

500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times {{also gave}} a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film. Saltz praised Mamoru Hosoda's direction, and says it [...] "matches the clean, classically composed images of his [...] outer story." [...] She further praised the visuals and themes, comparing it to those of director Yasujirō Ozu. In his review for Variety critic Peter Debruge stated that Hosoda's direction [...] "appeals to the hard-to-please teen crowd by taking mind-bending ideas and planting them within a relatable contempo context." [...] He also praised the CG animation in the OZ sequences. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Hosoda's style and said that it [...] "adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that the serene real <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> like a dream state." [...] He also likened Hosoda's style to that of Hayao Miyazaki and Nintendo. Hartlaub complained that Kenji's character is [...] "a bit too over-caffeinated in the first part" [...] {{and concluded that the}} film is [...] "the kind of fun and quirky film that you don't see very often in art houses this time of year." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He stated that [...] "Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments" [...] and also praised Satoko Okudera's writing, stating that it [...] "stakes a claim for the non-virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan’s medieval era." [...] He also praised the OZ animation sequences as [...] "visually ravishing explorations of white-on-white cyberspace, but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé." [...] Burr notes that in the film, [...] "it's what's old that's made to seem refreshingly new." [...] In his review for the New York Post V.A. Musetto gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called the film [...] "great despite its structural problems". Musetto also complained about the storyline, stating that the [...] "sci-fi elements seem silly rather than suspenseful." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The Village Voice also praised the film's visuals, and said that [...] "it’s hard to appreciate things like the character detail amid the insufferably squealy voicing and arbitrary suspense." ...|$|E

Further to the east, the wing containing staff and conference rooms is faced with glazed blue tiles which imitate mathematical tiles—an 18th-century design element used frequently in Brighton but rarely found elsewhere. The west side is the only other clearly visible elevation (it faces Jubilee Street); the ground floor is continuously glazed, and above this layers of blue and green imitation mathematical tiles are interspersed with windows at irregular intervals.

The single appeared on their next album, Cyclone Raymond, produced by Steve James, Mark Moffatt, Mark Opitz and Robyn Smith; which peaked into the top 40 ARIA Albums Charts in October 1989. A planned first single for 1989, [...] "Love Comes Running" [...] was cancelled from release in Australia, instead appearing in New Zealand only. The first single released in 1989 from the album, [...] "The <b>World</b> <b>Seems</b> Difficult" [...] was a top twenty hit, but polished up for the overseas market, sounded unlike anything the band had previously released. Two further singles, [...] "Baby You're Wild" [...] and [...] "Overwhelmed" [...] did not peak into the top 50, and promotion of the album was hindered after Smith injured his arm in a horse riding accident, and was hospitalised, which forced tour concerts to be postponed or cancelled.

2500|$|... ll New-York {{moves on}} the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the {{everlasting}} hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the <b>world</b> <b>seems</b> to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, they sit on the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world. And I, who have almost as strong a love of localities as poor puss, turn away from the windows, with a suppressed anathema on the nineteenth century, with its perpetual changes. Do you want an appropriate emblem of this country, and this age? Then stand on the side-walks of New-York, and watch the universal transit {{on the first}} of May ... However, human being are such creatures of habit and imitation, that what is necessity soon becomes fashion, and each one wishes to do what everyone else is doing. A lady in the neighbourhood closed all her binds and shutters, on May-day; being asked by her acquaintance whether she had been in the country, she answered, [...] "I was ashamed not to be moving {{on the first of}} May; and so I shut up the house that the neighbours might not know it." [...] One could not well imagine a fact more characteristic of the despotic sway of custom and public opinion, in the United States, and the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Blending {{literary}} elements {{is always}} a difficult task; Aphra Behn took on the challenge with Oroonoko. Restoration literature had three common elements: the New World setting, courtly romance, {{and the concept of}} heroic tragedy. John Dryden, a prominent playwright in 1663, co-wrote The Indian Queen and wrote the sequel The Indian Emperour. Both plays have the three aspects of Restoration literature, and [...] "Behn was certainly familiar with both plays", influencing her writing as seen in the opening of the tale. Behn takes the Restoration themes and recreates them, bringing originality. One reason Behn may have changed the elements is because Oroonoko was written {{near the end of the}} Restoration period. Readers were aware of the theme, so Behn wanted to give them something fresh. Behn changed the New World setting, creating one that readers were unfamiliar with. Challenging her literary abilities even further, Behn recreates the Old World setting. Behn gives readers an exotic world, filling their heads with descriptive details. Behn was the first person to blend new elements with the old Restoration essentials. The New World was set in the contemporary British Caribbean, not in Mexico as previous centuries were accustomed to. With a new setting came a new villain, the British and their practice of Colonialism. The New World gave readers knowledge of a foreign place, “a colony in America called Surinam, in the West Indies”. Behn paints a picture-perfect New World unspoiled by natives—one that contrasts with Dryden's previous work. Unlike Dryden, she does not blame cruelty on distant tyrant leaders; instead, she places the blame on Colonialism. Behn's New <b>World</b> <b>seems</b> almost utopian as she describes how the people get along: “with these People, … we live in perfect Tranquility, and good Understanding, as it behooves us to do.” This New World is unique during this period; it is [...] "simultaneously a marvelous prelapsarian paradise and the thoroughly commercialised crossroads of international trade”. It seems hard to believe that in such a romantic setting Behn can blend heroic tragedy, yet she accomplishes this effect through the character of Oroonoko. The Old World changes as Behn recreates the trade route back across the Atlantic to Africa, instead of Europe, becoming “the first European author who attempted to render the life lived by sub-Saharan African characters on their own continent.” There were few accounts of coastal African kingdoms at that time. Oroonoko is truly an original play blending three important elements in completely original ways, with her vision of the New World constituting a strong example of the change.|$|E
