Later designs of medium-powered freight locomotives, such as the LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 and LMS Ivatt Class 4 Moguls, had a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement: the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the BR Standard designs of locomotive.|$|E

5|$|Waltman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> {{again by}} TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006. There, Waltman {{defeated}} Raven in a Raven's Rules match, forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline. Waltman <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> {{by the company}} due to management being angered by his failure to participate at Unbreakable. Despite him not showing up to the event, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time.|$|E

5|$|A {{script for}} text <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog {{is the most}} important and is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five times, because the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{previous}} season's heroics, Primus <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> {{regularly in the}} early part of Portsmouth's first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3–5–2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4–4–2 and partnered new record signing Dejan Stefanović with Arjan de Zeeuw. During December, Portsmouth were in a terrible run of form and Redknapp decided to bring one of his most reliable players back into his plans for the derby match with Southampton. In spite of a 3–0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock logs {{were used}} to build the plank road. At that time, the tree's bark was {{a major source of}} tannin used to tan leather. The wood <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> much for lumber, so {{hundreds}} of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1648, {{during the}} Second English Civil War, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his {{brother-in-law}} William II, Prince of Orange, seemed {{more likely to}} provide substantial aid to the royalist cause than his mother's French relations. However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist Engager army of the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Matsueda and Eguchi {{made their}} first major {{collaboration}} by scoring the role-playing racing game Racing Lagoon, with synthesizer programmer Ryo Yamazaki providing three tracks. Matsueda {{was responsible for}} all the music except the battle, opening, and ending themes. They collaborated again on the soundtrack to the PlayStation 2 title The Bouncer in 2000, whereas the two took a more equal share of the music. A large amount of the compositions produced <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> {{in the game and}} there were also many post-production demands. Afterward, Matsueda created 25 pieces of background music for Square's PlayOnline viewer used for Final Fantasy XI and Tetra Master.|$|E
5|$|In June 1854, McClellan {{was sent}} {{on a secret}} {{reconnaissance}} mission to Santo Domingo {{at the behest of}} Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> until 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E
50|$|Almost all Protestant churches {{practice}} communion {{under both}} kinds.

5|$|It {{was never}} {{attacked}} again. The windmill was rebuilt in 1700, and was probably {{still in use}} until the 1780s. In 1703, Jacques Le Ber de Senneville constructed a large stone house and fort {{in order to improve}} and protect his fur trading operations, and the local seigneural manor house was built in 1706. However, after the fall of New France in 1763, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> by the British as a military post. In 1776, Fort Senneville was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by Continental Army troops under Benedict Arnold, in military manoeuvres associated with the Battle of the Cedars.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{urged his}} aides {{to break the}} news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz—a request that may have saved his assassin's life. McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used.</b> McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E
