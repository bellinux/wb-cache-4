25|$|A wooden {{plane is}} entirely wood {{except for the}} blade. The iron is held into the plane with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge,</b> and is {{adjusted}} by striking the plane with a hammer.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge.</b> The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{happened}} that while they had been talking, the boy had gone on driving in his <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> into the cleft that the iron one had made, {{and it had been}} gradually splitting the log open more and more. So that just as the boy was saying that [...] "a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> wouldn't do," [...] Rollo was actually seeing with his own eyes that it would do; for at that moment the boy gave the last blow, and the halves of the log came apart and fell over, one to one side, and the other to the other.|$|E
5000|$|... before 1887: An unknown party {{reached at}} least the Northern peak via the first ascent route, but {{avoiding}} the Mummery crack by driving <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> into a crack on the East side of the ridge.|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{matrices}} {{and reflective}} wedges {{are difficult to}} adapt, thus their ability to prevent gingival overhang was compared in this study with metal matrices and <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges.</b> Class II MOD cavitieswere prepared and randomly divided into six groups. Group I microhybrid composite, Group II flowable composite liner and Group III compomer. In above 3 groups metal matrices and <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> were used. Group IV microhybrid composite, Group V flowable composite liner and GroupVI compomer. In above 3 groups transparent matrices and light reflecting wedges were used. Specimens were filled with respective resin composite material, using corresponding matrix andwedge. Percentage of gingival overhang was determined under SEM. The result showed greateroverhang formation in transparent matrix group compared to metal matrix group as transparentmatrices are difficult {{to adapt to the}} teet...|$|R
5000|$|... the kithara, also a strummed string instrument, more {{complicated}} than the lyre. It had a box-type frame with strings stretched from the cross-bar at the top to the sounding box at the bottom; it was held upright and played with a plectrum. The strings were tunable by adjusting <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> along the cross-bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know exactly}} what difference," [...] said the boy; [...] "only I know you can't do any thing with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> until you have first opened a seam with an iron one." ...|$|E
60|$|So the boy put {{the large}} <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> in, {{at a little}} {{distance}} from the iron one, and drove it in rather gently with the beetle. This opened the cleft a little more, so that the iron wedge came out pretty easily.|$|E
60|$|Rollo was {{confident}} {{that it could not}} possibly make any difference whether a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> was used first or last. The boy was sure that it did, though he could not tell why. Finally, they determined to try it; so the boy struck his axe into the end of the next log, and then attempted to drive in his <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge.</b> But he did not succeed at all. The wedge would not stay. Rollo told him that he did not strike hard enough. Then he struck harder, but it did no good. The wedge dropped out the moment he let go of it, and on taking it up, they found that the edge of it was bruised and battered; so that even Rollo gave up all hopes of making it enter.|$|E
50|$|Scotchman and his Pack, Bristol. Nothing {{to do with}} Scotland. The pub is {{situated}} {{at the bottom of}} the very steep St Michael's Hill. Vehicles going up the hill were prevented from rolling downwards by means of <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges,</b> called scotches, placed behind the wheels by a scotchman who carried the scotches in a pack.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the wedge is not known. In ancient Egyptian quarries, bronze wedges were used to break away blocks of stone used in construction. <b>Wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> that swelled after being {{saturated}} with water, were also used. Some indigenous peoples of the Americas used antler wedges for splitting and working wood to make canoes, dwellings and other objects.|$|R
25|$|<b>Wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the wagon {{to the extent that}} the wagon is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{they have}} {{the back of the}} wedge wider still? and then it would force the wood open farther; and then you would not have to put in a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> afterwards,--so," [...] he added, making a sign with his fingers. He put {{the tips of his fingers}} together, and then {{separated}} his hands, so as to represent a very blunt-shaped wedge.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{held the}} edge of the knife {{to the end of the}} board, and then drove it in a little way, with his little beetle. This made a small opening or cleft in the angle or edge of the board at one end. Then he began to drive in his <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge,</b> telling Nathan to look {{carefully}} and see when it began to split. Nathan stood near him, stooping down, with his hands upon his knees, and looking on with great attention.|$|E
60|$|He {{struck it}} first upon one side, and then upon the other, and thus {{gradually}} worked it out. The walnut was crushed all to pieces. The boy then drove in the wedge again, {{so as to}} open the log as it was before. He {{then went to the}} place where he had got the beetle and wedge at first, and brought a large <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> which he had made before, and began to put that into the crack, not very far from the iron wedge.|$|E

5000|$|A quarry is {{a unique}} {{addition}} to the megalithic complex of the island. Stones of the quarry have clear traces of copper tools as well as <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges.</b> By means of these wedges and water ancient megalithic builders could cut granite and extract needed stone blocks. There are also traces of extractions of large stone plates used as megalithic capstones.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{show you}} in a minute," [...] said the boy. So he took the iron wedge, {{and went to work}} driving it into the log. It soon began to make a crack, which ran along the log, and opened wider and wider. When, at length, it was pretty wide, he put the <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> in, and he showed Rollo that the edge of the wedge did not now have to force its way, but went easily into the crack, and only the sides came in contact with the two parts of the log which it was separating.|$|E
60|$|A stout <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> {{driven in}} at my right temple and out at my left, a {{floating}} deposit of lukewarm oil in my throat, and a compression {{of the bridge}} of my nose in a blunt pair of pincers,-- these are the personal sensations by which I know we are off, and by which I shall continue to know it until I am on the soil of France. My symptoms have scarcely established themselves comfortably, when two or three skating shadows that {{have been trying to}} walk or stand, get flung together, and other two or three shadows in tarpaulin slide with them into corners and cover them up. Then the South Foreland lights begin to hiccup at us in a way that bodes no good.|$|E

5000|$|The {{boat was}} {{constructed}} of oak planks, stitched together with yew withies and also fixed together with <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges.</b> [...] This makes it {{similar to the}} Ferriby boats, which are also stitched planks.

5000|$|As Seifert {{entered the}} school {{compound}} through the smaller of two gates he was observed by three crossing guards who mistook {{him for a}} mechanic trying to repair the gate's broken lock and {{asked him what he}} was doing there. Seifert ignored them and, after blocking off the gate with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge,</b> proceeded towards teacher Anna Langohr who was teaching a group of girls in sports at the schoolyard. When Langohr, who knew Seifert, asked if she could help him, he ignited his flamethrower and attacked her and the girls.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} drum head {{is made of}} processed cow skin. Usually {{there are}} 12 hinges that hold the drum head to the wooden trunk using thick ropes. Typical drum head size is about 32 cm and about 23 cm inner diameter. Playing area of drum head is about 20 cm in diameter. Wedges inserted inside the ropes are twisted to tighten or loosen the drum head while tuning. A tubular <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge</b> is tied to {{edge of the drum}} head to roll using dominant hand. Traditionally the chande must be tuned to an octave above singers tonic (Higher Shadja).|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you make}} your wedges of hard wood, {{it will not be}} {{necessary}} to have iron rings to your beetle, because it will not get battered much, in driving <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges.</b> Now you must go to the wood pile, and look out a piece of round wood, about as large round as my arm, and bore a hole in it." ...|$|R
50|$|On 23 August, {{an engine}} room hatch, {{improperly}} latched, began to leak — 15 gallons per hour at 90 feet. <b>Wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> were {{driven into the}} coaming, reducing the flow to a drip. S-42 continued on to the Solomons. She arrived on station five days later and remained into September; but — without modern electronics, quick maneuverability, and speed — {{she was unable to}} close the night convoys from Rabaul.|$|R
5000|$|The rails {{were planned}} to be {{fabricated}} from 10 feet s with a cross-section of 6 inches by 4 inches wide and would be attached to round sleepers measuring [...] feet in length, with slots {{the size of the}} rails' cross-section set on edge and keyed in by two <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> driven against the rails and the sleepers. To facilitate the wheels of a locomotive, the rails projected two inches above the sleepers.|$|R
50|$|In the {{simplest}} sand casting procedure, the drag is placed {{upside down on}} a board, around a pattern of the part to be cast. The pattern {{is a model of}} the desired casting. Talcum powder is often dusted over the pattern to aid in the removal of the pattern. Sand is sifted over the pattern until the model is covered by a few inches of sand. More sand is then dumped into the drag, and rammed with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge,</b> or mechanically vibrated to pack the sand down. The sand is then struck level with the top edge of the cope, using a wooden or metal strake. A board is then placed on top of the drag and the drag is flipped over.|$|E
50|$|Professor Filip {{selects a}} four-member {{team for the}} trip, and their {{expedition}} begins. The expedition plans to spend {{just a few hours}} in the past to save the formula from being burned by a fire in Adam Bernau's home, but something goes wrong, and they are forced to spend several weeks. In the end they realize that the so-called formula was just a juvenile imagination of Adam Bernau and they return to the future, taking with them the old Mr Drchlík, who has helped them much in the past. Mr Drchlík notices the Central Brain standing asymmetric and fixes this with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge,</b> and suddenly the Central Brain realizes an error in its calculation. The whole expedition had been moot.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{moulding}} {{planes were}} blocks of wear resistant hardwood, often beech or maple, which were worked {{to the shape}} of the intended moulding. The blade, or iron was likewise formed to the intended moulding profile and secured {{in the body of the}} plane with a <b>wooden</b> <b>wedge.</b> A traditional cabinetmakers shop might have many, perhaps hundreds, of moulding planes for the full range of work to be performed. The late nineteenth century brought modern types which were all-metal affairs such as the American Stanley No. 55 Universal Plane and the English Record No. 405 Multi-Plane with a wide variety of interchangeable cutters, integral fences, and [...] "nickers", small cutting edges which score the grain fibers when working across the board.|$|E
50|$|As the cask empties, {{it needs}} to be gently tilted to obtain the last of the beer. With <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges,</b> moving the rear wedge forward will achieve this; {{purpose-built}} metal units often have springs incorporated that automatically tilt the cask as it becomes lighter. This requires less effort from bar staff, and also helps beer quality - the lift is so smooth and gradual that there is no danger of stirring up the lees and making the beer cloudy.|$|R
50|$|The main conduit {{is almost}} {{horizontal}} here, and surrounded be meter high walls on both sides. One side with stone, {{the other is}} mainly dirt, but eventually becomes the outer wall of Mina Preta. On some sections {{one can see the}} pillow (almofada) finish that is said be a Roman design. In some sections one can see wedge formed grooves on the outer edges. This from the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>wedges</b> that are put in water to expand to cut the stones.|$|R
