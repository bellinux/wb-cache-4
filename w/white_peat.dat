50|$|Genuine ombrotrophic bogs on the North German Plain {{are usually}} sharply {{divided into two}} layers: an {{underlying}} black peat layer, which is strongly decomposed, and an overlying <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> layer which is less decomposed. This difference {{is a result of}} changes in the hydrology of the bog. The <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> grew more rapidly under humid conditions than the black peat. This is attributed to a climate change with high precipitation and low evaporation around 1000 to 500 BC. As a result, the peat moss growth grew locally and the black peat/white peat boundary layer was formed, although this did not develop simultaneously in all raised bogs.|$|E
5000|$|Growing bogs can {{be divided}} into two layers. The 'acrotelm' (Greek: akros = highest; telma = bog) is the upper part and {{includes}} the vegetation layer and the bog 'floor'. Here fresh organic substances (peat formation horizon) are created by the growth and dying of plant elements. The [...] "catotelm" [...] (Greek: kato = below) is the underlying water-saturated part with less biological activity. This layer is counted as a geological subsoil due to the small earth-forming processes that are still going on and is known as the peat preservation horizon (Torferhaltungshorizont). In raised bogs, the upper peat layer is called <b>white</b> <b>peat,</b> since it consists of largely undecomposed light brown peat mosses. The lower layer is black peat, which is already well humified and has a black-brown colour with still recognizable plant remains.|$|E

50|$|The geology of {{the parish}} is {{primarily}} alluvial plains to the south, and karstic limestone to the north. The karstic zones are known to contain over 130 caves (Jamaica Cave Register as of 2007 - from Fincham and JCO). These include Mexico Cave and Wallingford River Cave, near Balaclava, which are two associated sections of a major underground river that has its source in south Trelawny, as well as Yardley Chase Caves near the foot of Lovers' Leap, and Peru Cave, near Goshen, which has stalactites and stalagmites. Mineral deposits include bauxite, antimony, <b>white</b> limestone, clay, <b>peat</b> and silica sand {{which is used to}} manufacture glass.|$|R
50|$|A {{quaking bog}} or schwingmoor {{is a form}} of bog {{occurring}} in wetter parts of valley bogs and raised bogs, and sometimes around the edges of acidic lakes. The bog vegetation, mostly sphagnum moss anchored by sedges (such as Carex lasiocarpa), forms a floating mat approximately half a metre thick, {{on the surface of the}} water or on top of very wet <b>peat.</b> <b>White</b> spruces are also common in this bog regime. Walking on the surface causes it to move - larger movements may cause visible ripples on the surface, or they may even make trees sway. In the absence of disturbance from waves, the bog mat may eventually cover entire bays, or even entire small lakes.|$|R

40|$|N-immobilization of wood fiber {{substrates}} during {{production of}} vegetable transplants was studied in greenhouse and under phytotron conditions. Tomato transplants were grown on <b>white</b> <b>peat,</b> unimpregnated and impregnated wood fiber with three N-levels respectively N-immobilization was calculated {{on the basis}} of N-balance including N-uptake by plants and residual mineral N in the substrates. in addition, the influence on net photosynthesis rate was examined. Higher N-immobilization was found by increasing of N-application rates. Net-N-immobilization in impregnated wood fiber substrates was comparable to <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> with 100 mg N l(- 1). Tomato transplants, cultivated on impregnated wood fiber substrates, showed significantly higher growth compared to plants cultivated in unimpregnated wood fibers. With additional N-fertilization (level N 3) the significance of N-immobilization in impregnated wood fiber substrates for the growth of tomato plants could be neglected. However, general recommendations for the amount of fertilizer to be added are difficult, because of strongly varying contents of mineral nutrients in the different substrate loads. Nevertheless, it is necessary to supply wood fiber substrates with nutrient solutions or fertilizer from the beginning of plant culture. Substrates without plants, exposed to the same conditions showed the same tendencies in N-immobilization, as substrates with plants. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Since 2001 {{we have been studying}} peatmoss cultivation (‘Sphagnum farming’) in greenhouse and ﬁeld experiments, paying special attention to propagation, propagule storage, establishment, productivity and regeneration. Our studies show that Sphagnum farming in Germany may provide a sustainable high-quality alternative to fossil <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> as a raw material for horticultural growing media.

25|$|Most Nepenthes species grow in {{environments that}} provide high {{humidity}} and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including N.ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive {{on the margins}} of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N.mirabilis) have been found growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of <b>peat,</b> <b>white</b> sand, sandstone, or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N.rajah), on sandy beaches in the sea spray zone (e.g. N.albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N.inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, industrial peat has been mined in Hunteburg. Founded in 1909 Hanoverian colonization and mud recovery Aktiengesellschaft (Hakumag built in Schwegermoor a power plant with an electrical capacity of 2.6 megawatts. From the peat sulphate of ammonia by charring should be recovered as nitrogen fertilizer. The waste methane gas was used to generate electricity. Opened in 1911, the Hakumag the work. Since the delivered Torfmengen is not sufficient due to the long drying process, the power plant was shut down in 1913. In the following years, the Hakumag limited to the sale of <b>white</b> and black <b>peat.</b> In the 1920s and 1930s, seasonal workers were employed, among others, from the Netherlands and Slovakia in the bog. During World War II the Hakumag used forced laborers as well as Polish and Russian prisoners of war.|$|R

30|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} peanut shell compost decreased phosphorus uptake in leaves {{in comparison to}} the control (compost more than 15  %). It appears that microorganisms converted mineral P to organic P during organic matter mineralization, thereby temporarily decreasing the availability of phosphorus (Mohammadi Tarkashvand et al. 2005). The lowest phosphorus uptake was obtained in the 45  % compost treatment. This may have been due to the dilution effect, because of the larger size of the plant and a decreasing P concentration. Grigatti et al. (2007) also reported a decrease of phosphorus uptake by mimulus and salvia plants in beds containing green waste compost and sewage sludge when compared with controls (<b>white</b> <b>peat).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{commercial}} substrates (a mixture of forest residues, composted grape husks, and <b>white</b> <b>peat,</b> black peat and coir) on plant growth and nitrogen (N) and nitrate (NO 3) concentration and content were evaluated in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Tapir). Spinach seedlings were transplanted at 45 days after emergence into Styrofoam boxes {{filled with the}} substrates and were grown during winter and early spring in an unheated greenhouse with no supplemental lighting. Each planting box was irrigated daily by drip and fertilized with a complete nutrient solution. The NO 3 content of the drainage water was lower in coir than in the other substrates.

40|$|Two {{international}} {{interlaboratory trials}} {{for the analysis}} of growing media and soil improvers were performed. Samples of <b>white</b> sphagnum <b>peat,</b> coir dust, composted green material, uncomposted bark, peat mixture and a peat and clay mixture were tested. Of the materials the pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content and ash, dry matter content, moisture content, laboratory compacted bulk density, dry bulk density, air volume, water volume, shrinkage value and total pore space were determined using European Standards. The results give an idea about the excitability and reliability of the methods. Results were variable. As a reference a test performed for European standardization was used. Results less good as obtained in the former trial were found for the pH of bark. This appeared to be a difficult material for the pH determination. Also the repeatability and reproducibility results of the organic matter determination of the peat and clay mixture were bad. This can either be caused by the fact that laboratories do not exactly follow the procedure, or the method is more reliable for high organic matter contents and should perhaps be adapted for materials with a low organic matter content. The laboratory compacted bulk density results of the performed test are in most cases satisfactory. The determination of physical parameters were not always good. The repeatability and reproducibility of dry bulk density of composted green material were extremely high. Probably due to the constitution of this compost, dry bulk density is difficult to determine. The method is not suitable for this type of material. Results for bark and peat and clay mixture are also rather poor. For particle density it appeared that some laboratories used another formula as prescribed. Next trial and an amendment will have to be made about how total pore space has to be calculated from particle density. For water and air volume the repeatability and reproducibility results of one of the interlaboratory trials were not good when compared to the former trial. There is not a clear reason but perhaps laboratories need to gain more experience for these determinations. The results show that it is essential to have interlaboratory trials for the physical and chemical characterization of growing media and soil improvers. The procedures still need further improvement. The only way to find out for a laboratory if it is producing the right data, is to participate in these trials. If the standards are to be submitted for national or international regulations this is even more important...|$|R

40|$|White horticultural peat is a microbiologically active {{growing medium}} which binds {{significant}} quantities of nutrients and water {{due to its}} favourable cation exchange capacity and porosity. Unfortunately, horticultural peat is only very slowly renewable, and good quality horticultural peat is not common even in peatland-rich countries. Therefore, good-quality and simultaneously renewable alternative growing media are needed. A new growing medium based on Sphagnum moss biomass is introduced in this study. According to our results, harvesting of Sphagnum biomass {{to a depth of}} no more than 30 cm will have a relatively short-term effect on Sphagnum carpet coverage and carbon sequestration, allowing a harvesting cycle of ~ 30 years to be achieved. Therefore, the average harvesting depth will be 30 cm. Only half of the mire surface on each harvesting area will be utilised, the other half being kept intact for transportation routes. This will also secure a reserve of Sphagnum mosses for reseeding and recovery. The end product - Sphagnum biomass based growing medium - will be truly renewable, and environmental effects will be negligible compared with conventional extraction of white horticultural peat. Therefore, Sphagnum biomass harvesting is more comparable with sustainable forestry management than with the production of <b>white</b> <b>peat,</b> which causes drastic and long-term alterations of the mire ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{correlate}} results of a fast extract-based toxicity test with results of an established growing test with mostly pre-grown plants. A standard <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> was contaminated with four levels of TCA (trichloroacetic acid), a known toxic substance. A range was composed of five levels of TCA, including zero, 0. 0013, 0. 013, 0. 13, and 1. 3 g/L of peat. Part of the material was entered in Phytotoxkit containers {{and covered with a}} filter paper. At {{the other side of the}} filter paper two dicotyledonous species, garden cress (Lepidium sativum) and mustard (Sinapis alba) and one monocotyledon, Sorghum (Sorghum saccharatum) were allowed to germinate for a three day period on the extract from the substrate in a climate-controlled cabinet. The same range of amended peats was used in the standard test to grow transplanted lettuce (Lactuca sativa), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis) and directly sown barley (Hordeum vulgare). For the Phytotoxkit the above ground length and root length were recorded, and for the standard test the fresh weight and dry weight of the above ground parts were recorded. Results showed a growth reduction for all levels of TCA when using the standard method. When using the Phytotoxkit only the two highest concentrations of TCA reduced growth. For screenings of product alternatives or dissolution series the Phytotoxkit is a faster and cheaper alternativ...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to reduce}} {{peatland}} exploitation has increased demand for materials that can at least partially replace peat in root substrate mixes. In this study four substrates containing 10 % perlite, or 10, 30 and 50 % rice hulls (RH) (the rest being <b>white</b> <b>peat)</b> were evaluated alone or amended with 20 % of the anaerobic digested residues of fruit and wine distillery stillage wastes (ADR). Substrates were analyzed physically and chemically and used to grow Euphorbia pulcherrima L. 'Red Fox Cosmo Red' and Pelargonium ×hortorum Bailey 'Green Aida Red'. A compostable RH pot was also evaluated {{as an alternative to}} the conventional plastic one. Substrates containing 10 % RH were very similar to the one containing 10 % perlite, while substrates with 50 % RH had higher pH, total pore space, air-filled porosity and nitrate nitrogen and potassium concentrations and lower electrical conductivity, water holding capacity, bulk density and ammonium nitrogen concentrations compared to the 10 % RH substrate. The addition of ADR reduced organic matter concentration and increased pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, and almost all nutrient concentrations. For both species growth with 10 % RH substrates was similar to that with 10 % perlite. However, while in poinsettia, only 50 % RH gave worse performances than 10 % perlite, in zonal geranium, growth was already poorer with 30 % RH. ADR reduced poinsettia growth in general, while root growth of zonal geranium was improved. RH pots affected root dry weight, which significantly decreased in zonal geranium...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of three major forms of peat processing by the manufacturing industry in The Netherlands since {{the last quarter of}} the 19 th century. At a time when peat as a fuel was gradually being replaced by coal, the first form was the peat moss litter industry. Peat moss litter was made from <b>white</b> <b>peat</b> that was ground and sieved in factories which were located mainly in bog areas in the south-east of the province of Drenthe. It served as excellent bedding for horses and cattle. The second form of industrial peat processing was the manufacture, from 1921 onwards, of active carbon made from black peat. The Purit (Norit) factory, now part of the Cabot Corporation, is still the only active carbon factory using peat as a raw material. The third form of peat processing was the production of garden peat and potting soil. This is still a widespread activity in peat areas all over the world. The peat moss litter industry thrived from the 1880 s until shortly after the First World War. The arrival of the horse-drawn tram in all of the major cities of Europe created a great demand for animal bedding to be used in the vast stables of the tramway companies. Peat moss litter was cleaner, healthier and easier to handle than straw. There was similar demand from the armies, which used millions of horses during the First World War. Owing to the development of motorised vehicles, the peat market collapsed after the war and this plunged the industry into a prolonged crisis which was not overcome until peat was found to be a suitable growing medium for horticulture in the 1950 s. Living and working conditions in peatlands were harsh, earnings irregular and labourers’ rights limited. The peat manufacturing industry was the first to introduce collective labour agreements, medical benefits and pension plans. Nonetheless massive unemployment, poverty and the necessity to migrate to other parts of the country were clear signs that the era of peat was over for all but a handful of labourers...|$|E
