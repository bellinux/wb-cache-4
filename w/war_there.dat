5|$|After her April 1916 commissioning, Tucker sailed in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Tucker {{was part}} of the second U.S. {{destroyer}} squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Tucker made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. For her part in rescuing crewmen from the Dupetit-Thouars in August 1918, Tucker received a commendation from the Préfet Maritime. In June, Tucker was transferred to Brest, France, and spent the remainder of the <b>war</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|After her July 1915 commissioning, Wadsworth {{served on}} the {{neutrality}} patrol off the east coast and in the Caribbean. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Wadsworth was the flagship of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Wadsworth reported several encounters with U-boats in the first months overseas. She was transferred to Brest, France, in March 1918, and spent {{the remainder of the}} <b>war</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the Second World <b>War,</b> <b>there</b> {{was a large}} {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the <b>war</b> <b>there</b> were {{extended}} {{arguments over}} how the pipelines should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. The pipelines are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>war</b> <b>there</b> {{were several}} plans (Project 27) to {{reconstruct}} Petropavlovsk, {{as she was}} now known, using the bow of Frunze and moving her third turret to the forward position, {{but they were not}} accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed Volkhov, after the nearby river, on 28 November 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken on 4 September 1953 and broken up afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of <b>war,</b> <b>there</b> was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Temple was {{promoted}} to colonel and became governor of Tilbury Fort in Essex, a post {{that had previously been}} held by his father. The fort was close to Temple's childhood home at Longhouse Place and was of strategic importance because it controlled the approach to London by river. During the Second Civil <b>War,</b> <b>there</b> were Royalist uprisings in Kent and Essex. Temple's control of Tilbury Fort for Parliament enabled Lord Fairfax's troops to cross from Gravesend to Tilbury on route to Colchester for the siege of royalists in that town.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{development}} of petroleum, the island was largely devoted to pearl fisheries and, {{as late as the}} 19th century, was considered to be the finest in the world. In 1903, German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, visited Bahrain and took many photographs of historical sites, including the old Qaṣr es-Sheikh, photos now stored at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Prior to the First World <b>War,</b> <b>there</b> were about 400 vessels hunting pearls and an annual export of more than £30,000.|$|E

5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} <b>war,</b> <b>there</b> has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|Due in part {{to these}} {{personal}} trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia's interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve {{as chairman of the}} Committee on Expenditures in the Department of <b>War.</b> <b>There</b> are notable disparities between Tucker's more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay On Instructions to Representatives, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{division}} was mobilised for war in December 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before being deployed to New Guinea in 1943 where they {{took part in}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign against the Japanese in 1943–44, before returning to Australia for rest and reorganisation. In late 1944 they were sent to Bougainville to take part in their final campaign of the <b>war.</b> <b>There</b> they undertook a series of advances across the island before the war came to an end in August 1945.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of <b>war,</b> <b>there</b> still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold <b>War</b> <b>there</b> {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World <b>War,</b> <b>there</b> were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged from the war {{relatively}} unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E
