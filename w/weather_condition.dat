25|$|Modern radar {{technology}} {{enables the}} monitoring of large {{areas and the}} localization of avalanches at any <b>weather</b> <b>condition,</b> by day and by night. Complex alarm systems are able to detect avalanches {{within a short time}} in order to close (e.g. roads and rails) or evacuate (e.g. construction sites) endangered areas. An example of such a system is installed on the only access road of Zermatt in Switzerland. Two radars monitor the slope of a mountain above the road. The system automatically closes the road by activating several barriers and traffic lights within seconds such that no persons are harmed.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 {{discovery}} {{prompted a}} detailed unofficial re-investigation into {{the causes of}} the two crashes. This investigation ruled out pilot error, sabotage and mechanical failure. Ultimately, the cause was determined from contemporary <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> reports from air traffic that were archived in the United Kingdom. Both crashes were attributed to extreme weather conditions on the approach to the airport on the two nights in question. These conditions are now referred to as microbursts. The results were published in a newspaper in Bahrain and had the support of Gulf Air's safety officer. The report was also relayed to France via its embassy in Bahrain, with the recommendation that the pilots be exonerated due to conditions unknown at the time and beyond their capability to counteract.|$|E

While current and forecast weather may {{be a factor in}} deciding which type of flight plan to file, <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> themselves do not affect one's filed flight plan. For example, an IFR flight that encounters visual meteorological conditions (VMC) en route does not automatically change to a VFR flight, and the flight must still follow all IFR procedures regardless of <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> In the US, <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> are forecast broadly as VFR, MVFR (Marginal Visual Flight Rules), IFR, or LIFR (Low Instrument Flight Rules).|$|R
25|$|On {{the second}} day, {{search and rescue}} {{personnel}} from Masamba and Makassar searched the same area with one helicopter and three aircraft from Aviastar. The search area was widened, from Palopo and the surrounding areas to Luwu shoreline. In a press conference, BASARNAS reported that {{the position of the}} missing plane was around 14 nautical square miles. It had officially widened to 24 nautical square miles, which would take around 2.5 hours by land from the nearest city. There were three coordinates which BASARNAS suspected to be the crash site, which is at 14 nautical miles, 24 nautical miles and 34 nautical miles. The aircraft was finally located by the signal from the engineer's cellphone, which was set in Airplane Mode. The search operation was hampered due to poor <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> in the area. At early dusk, some people reported that the plane was found in the area of Sidrap. The claim was later investigated.|$|E

30|$|However, {{vehicle speed}} {{decreased}} due to bad <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> (rain and snow) and the decrease was substantially higher on roads without lighting than on roads with lighting. Our results therefore suggests that when road lighting is present, drivers respond less strongly to worsened <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially during darkness. This indicates that road lighting may indeed induce higher vehicle speed, but mainly in special circumstances such as “bad” <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> The presence of road lighting may therefore influence driving behavior so that drivers do not adapt adequately or {{as well to}} the prevailing <b>weather</b> <b>conditions</b> as they might if road lighting were not present. Although the correlation reported between the presence of road lighting and fewer accidents (e.g., Jackett and Frith 2013) {{would suggest that the}} higher visibility in general may compensate for the higher vehicle speed also in worsened <b>weather</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, <b>weather</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially rain, has been shown to significantly affect the number of fatalities, serious injuries and light injuries.

[...] Nephi's exact wording is without parallel in the Bible. It rarely snows in temperate Jerusalem. Jewish prophets were acquainted with the white-capped mountains of Lebanon to the north ( [...] , , [...] ). Nephi's Promised Land description of the Tree of Life can be compared with Lehi's description of its fruit.

After extensive examination of weather chart conditions, among other factors, Rankin found that the small agricultural town of Tulare, located {{in the heart of}} California's San Joaquin Valley was the perfect spot for his flying school. Years worth of <b>weather</b> <b>condition</b> statistics, reflected that the San Joaquin Valley had the best flying conditions weather-wise in the U.S. Tulare's site itself also proved ideal as it was located 12 miles east of normal airways and 6 miles from the heart of town, and initially was a large tract of farm land, which held no undesirable obstructions on it. The school was located eight miles southeast of Tulare, California. [...] At the beginning of the new year in 1941, Rankin flew throughout the U.S., recruiting and hiring flight instructors.
