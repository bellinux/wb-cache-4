Yiddish theater had become a {{business}} there, with slickly written advertisements, coordinated performances in multiple cities using the same publicity materials, and cutthroat competition: on one occasion in 1895, a young man named Bernfeld attended multiple performances of Goldfaden's Story of Isaac, memorized it all (including the songs), and took the <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> to Kalman Juvilier, who put on an unauthorized production in Iaşi. Such outright theft was possible because once Ion Ghica headed off on a diplomatic career, the National Theater, which was supposed to adjudicate issues like unauthorized performances of plays, was no longer paying much attention to Yiddish theater.

Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling.

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E

2500|$|This assault forced Dr Hewson into {{a partial}} backdown, agreeing not to levy the GST on food. But this {{concession}} opened Hewson {{to charges of}} weakness and inconsistency, and also complicated the arithmetic of the <b>whole</b> <b>package,</b> since the weakening of the GST reduced the scope for tax cuts, the most attractive element of the package for middle-class voters. The complications of the new package were famously demonstrated in the [...] "birthday cake interview", in which Hewson was unable {{to answer a question}} posed by journalist Mike Willesee about whether or not a birthday cake would cost more or less under a Coalition government. Hewson was instead forced into a series of circumlocutions about whether the cake would be decorated, have ice cream in it and so on, considered by some as {{a turning point in the}} election campaign. In reference to the birthday cake interview in an August 2006 interview, Hewson said: [...] "Well I answered the question honestly. The answer's actually right. That doesn't count...I should have told him (Mike Willesee) to get stuffed!". According to Channel 9's 20 to 1 episode Unscripted and Unplanned, the Birthday Cake Interview incident was the moment Hewson lost the election with the interview held 10 days before polling day. However, polls right up to election day supported a Coalition victory.|$|E
2500|$|His grandson, {{the fifth}} Duke, succeeded {{to the title}} {{at the age of}} 25 in 1913. In 1914 he decided on the {{outbreak}} of the First World War that it was unwise to have so much of his riches tied up in land and property.

He was a great-great-grandson of the first Earl of Ellesmere, third son of the first Duke of Sutherland.

2500|$|For the Dreamcast version, AllGame commented, [...] "Xtreme Sports {{looks good}} but doesn't play well, {{a classic example}} of effort being put into visuals but not enough into the game's heart. When it comes to video games, style is important, but {{substance}} that is paramount when it comes to rating a title. And while Xtreme Sports offers a distinct experience in the way it combines a number of different events into a single track, it doesn't focus enough on the gameplay of the individual sports to make the <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> compelling." [...] GameSpot noted, [...] "If you're expecting six perfect games wrapped up in one title, you'll only find disappointment. However, if you're in the mood for a game where each event is reasonably well designed and integrated into a greater, meatier whole, then Infogrames' Xtreme Sports should prove satisfying." [...] IGN stated, [...] "Certainly not the greatest game to ever slide down the pipe, Xtreme Sports is still not without some charm. Yes, it could have been better had a couple of the events been tightened up in the gameplay department, and yeah, it would have made a lot more sense had the characters been more diverse from one another (Is it me, or is EVERYONE five foot nine?), but I guess that's what sequels are for.

Using detailed data on household consumption, we identify eight positions that are clearly similar in lifestyle. We then study how the lifestyles we identify are associated with saving, an important measure of household well-being. We find that households cluster into distinct lifestyles based on similarities and differences in consumption. These lifestyles are meaningfully related in social space and save in distinct ways that have important implications for understanding inequality and stratification...|$|R
60|$|She was, however, {{resolved}} {{to make the}} attempt. She {{sent a message to}} Caesar, asking permission to appear before him and plead her own cause.

6000|$|Upon {{the return}} of Glen from abroad, the commonest courtesy, {{not to say the}} blood-relation between them, {{prompted}} Pierre to welcome him home, with a letter, which though not over-long, and little enthusiastic, still breathed a spirit of cousinly consideration and kindness, pervadingly touched by the then naturally frank and all-attractive spirit of Pierre. To this, the less earnest and now Europeanized Glen had replied in a letter all sudden suavity; and in a strain of artistic artlessness, mourned the apparent decline of their friendship; yet fondly trusted that now, notwithstanding their long separation, it would revive with added sincerity. Yet upon accidentally fixing his glance upon the opening salutation of this delicate missive, Pierre thought he perceived certain, not wholly disguisable chirographic tokens, that the [...] "My very dear Pierre," [...] with which the letter seemed to have been begun, had originally been written [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] but that when all was concluded, and Glen's signature put to it, then the ardent words [...] "My very" [...] had been prefixed to the reconsidered [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] a casual supposition, which possibly, however unfounded, materially retarded any answering warmth in Pierre, lest his generous flame should only embrace a flaunted feather. Nor was this idea altogether unreinforced, when on the reception of a second, and now half-business letter (of which mixed sort nearly all the subsequent ones were), from Glen, he found that the [...] "My very dear Pierre" [...] had already retreated into [...] "My dear Pierre;" [...] and on a third occasion, into [...] "Dear Pierre;" [...] and on a fourth, had made a forced and very spirited advanced march up to [...] "My dearest Pierre." [...] All of which fluctuations augured ill for the determinateness of that love, which, however immensely devoted to one cause, could yet hoist and sail under the flags of all nations. Nor could he but now applaud a still subsequent letter from Glen, which abruptly, and almost with apparent indecorousness, under the circumstances, commenced the strain of friendship without any overture of salutation whatever; as if at last, owing to its infinite delicateness, entirely hopeless of precisely defining the nature of their mystical love, Glen chose rather to leave that precise definition to the sympathetical heart and imagination of Pierre; while he himself would go on to celebrate the general relation, by many a sugared sentence of miscellaneous devotion. It was a little curious and rather sardonically diverting, to compare these masterly, yet not wholly successful, and indeterminate tactics of the accomplished Glen, with the unfaltering stream of Beloved Pierres, which not only flowed along the top margin of all his earlier letters, but here and there, from their subterranean channel, flashed out in bright intervals, through all the succeeding lines. Nor had the chance recollection of these things at all restrained the reckless hand of Pierre, when he threw the <b>whole</b> <b>package</b> of letters, both new and old, into that most honest and summary of all elements, which is neither a respecter of persons, nor a finical critic of what manner of writings it burns; but like ultimate Truth itself, of which it is the eloquent symbol, consumes all, and only consumes.|$|E
