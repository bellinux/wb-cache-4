5|$|A return {{match against}} Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were {{fortunate}} {{to get a}} draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again {{came to the rescue}} with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in his shirt and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into his shirt.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, Gloucestershire {{made its}} first visit to Old Trafford Cricket Ground in July to play Lancashire {{and this was the}} match immortalised by Francis Thompson in his idyllic poem At Lord's. In a match against Surrey at Clifton, the ball lodged in Grace's shirt after he had played it and he seized the {{opportunity}} to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, it was agreed that three runs should be awarded.|$|E
25|$|According to Eichar's theory, the {{infrasound}} {{generated by}} the wind as it passed {{over the top of}} the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and mental distress in the hikers. Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope. By the time they were further down the hill, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of the infrasound's path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter. The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the ledge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.|$|E

25|$|Major Anderson {{held his}} fire, {{awaiting}} daylight. His troops reported for {{a call at}} 6 a.m. and then had breakfast. At 7 a.m., Capt. Abner Doubleday fired {{a shot at the}} Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point. He missed. Given the available manpower, Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns. He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely. The fort's best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiersthe barbette tierwhere his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead. The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault, and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort. However, the land-based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high-arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of naval guns' reach. Fort Sumter's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level, which themselves, because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures, were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie. Moreover, although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage, the fort was quite low on ammunition, and was nearly {{out at the end of}} the 34-hour bombardment. A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more, in some cases using socks from Anderson's personal wardrobe. Because of the shortages, Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns: two aimed at Cummings Point, two at Fort Moultrie, and two at the Sullivan's Island batteries.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Carlo D’Este {{wrote that}} the most logical place for a British attack <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of the Orne bridgehead, on the extreme eastern flank of the Allied lodgement. An attack there had been {{rejected}} by Montgomery, Dempsey and O’Connor as unrealistic. Some writers described the intent of Epsom as an attack to gain ground, while others {{have suggested that the}} operation had other objectives. In 2004, Williams wrote that due to ULTRA intercepts, Montgomery was aware of Rommel's plan to attack towards Bayeux and that Epsom was intended to forestall it. Wilmot in 1952 {{wrote that the}} operation was intended to draw the I SS Panzer Corps and the newly arrived II SS Panzer Corps into battle around Caen. Hart wrote that Montgomery wanted to keep the initiative and prevent German armoured forces from moving from to the west against the US First Army or being relieved and forming a reserve. The arrival of the II SS Panzer Corps was a catalyst for Operation Epsom, which retaining the initiative by forcing the German command to use the II SS Panzer Corps against VIII Corps. Hastings wrote in 1985 that [...] "no sane commander" [...] would mount an attack as big as Epsom without [...] "every hope of breaking through the German defences, or at least of causing the enemy to make substantial withdrawals". D’Este wrote that [...] "No amount of pretence can conceal that the real object had been a short pincer movement to outflank Caen".|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Genesis planet are the alien worms that rapidly evolve from microbes on Spock's coffin. The creatures start as small, slimy crawlers, then grow to lengths of [...] The small worms were created by injecting molten [...] "Hot-Melt" [...] vinyl into epoxy polymer molds that were immediately put into cold water to create a translucent product. The resulting hundred or so creatures were painted and coated with methacyl, a slippery, slimy coating. Each worm was attached to an elevated platform by a piece of fishing line; the lines were tied to rods underneath the set. Offscreen helpers pushed the rods or pulled fishing line to create motion; the scene required many takes because the fishing line would periodically flash at the camera. The larger worms proved more problematic, with filming taking place at ILM and Paramount Stage15. Similar to The Wrath of Khans parasitic Ceti eels, the worms featured cobra-like cowls and a ringed mouth of teeth. ILM built one of the worms with more articulation than the others; Ralston operated the creature {{through a hole in}} the set floor with his hand stuck inside the creature. The other worms were animated using pneumatic bladders that caused air to pass through hoses in sequence, creating an undulating motion. During the scene the worms attack Kruge, who kills one of them. The usual method for achieving the effect of the creature wrapping itself around Kruge would have been to film the sequence in reverse, but this posed problems: the slime coating Kruge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of place with reverse filming, and multiple takes would ruin the Klingon makeup Lloyd wore. ILM's solution involved rigging the worm with fishing lines that were pulled in a choreographed fashion by multiple off-screen helpers to simulate the wrapping movement. When small pieces of the Klingon uniforms caught or snapped the fishing lines, Ralston resorted to steel cables.|$|E

2500|$|On March 20, 2009, {{the town}} of Esparto, California was shaken and windows were {{shattered}} by a blast created by [...] of ANFO during filming of the myth [...] "Knock Your Socks Off". Some residents were upset that the blast took place without [...] "telling anyone". Chief Barry Burns, of Esparto Fire Department, had several firefighters {{on hand for the}} explosion. He said he made the decision not to notify anyone in town for safety's sake. [...] "MythBusters {{is supposed to be a}} really popular show.

[...] He later elaborated that [...] "The feel of Thor is a very different than Iron Man. Yet they live in the same universe. For me, it’s like somehow Indiana Jones showed up on the Enterprise, or something." [...] Tyler described The Dark World as [...] "science fiction meeting classic medieval war", and saw it as a cross between Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings—"there’s spaceships and lasers ... but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses ... those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for Thor: The Dark World <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> of place in the first film and vice versa." [...] Azam Ali, who collaborated with Tyler on Children of Dune, and Tori Letzler are featured vocalists for the score; Tyler felt that their contributions provided [...] "something emotional" [...] to the score.|$|E
