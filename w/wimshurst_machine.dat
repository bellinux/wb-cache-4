25|$|James Wimshurst (13 April 1832 – 3 January 1903) was an English inventor, {{engineer}} and shipwright. Though Wimshurst did not patent his machines {{and the various}} improvements that he made to them, his refinements to the electrostatic generator led to its becoming widely known as the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1878, the British {{inventor}} James Wimshurst {{started his}} studies about electrostatic generators, improving the Holtz machine, {{in a powerful}} version with multiple disks. The classical <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> that became the most popular form of influence machine, was reported to the scientific community by 1883, although previous machines with very similar structures were previously described by Holtz and Musaeus. [...] In 1885, one of the largest-ever Wimshurst machines was built in England (it {{is now at the}} Chicago Museum of Science and Industry). The <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> is a considerably simple machine; it works, as all influence machines, with electrostatic induction of charges, which means that it uses even the slightest existing charge to create and accumulate more charges, and repeats this process {{for as long as the}} machine is in action. Wimshurst machines are composed of: two insulated disks attached to pulleys of opposite rotation, the disks have small conductive (usually metal) plates on their outward-facing sides; two double-ended brushes that serve as charge stabilizers and are also the place where induction happens, creating the new charges to be collected; two pairs of collecting combs, which are, as the name implies, the collectors of electrical charge produced by the machine; two Leyden Jars, the capacitors of the machine; a pair of electrodes, for the transfer of charges once they have been sufficiently accumulated. The simple structure and components of the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>Machine</b> make it a common choice for a homemade electrostatic experiment or demonstration, these characteristics were factors that contributed to its popularity, as previously mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|In 1887, Weinhold {{modified}} the Leyser machine {{with a system}} of vertical metal bar inductors with wooden cylinders close to the disk for avoiding polarity reversals. M. L. Lebiez described the Lebiez machine, that was essentially a simplified Voss machine (L'Électricien, April 1895, pp.225–227). In 1893, Bonetti patented a machine with {{the structure of the}} <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> but without metal sectors in the disks., à l'extérieur." [...] ( [...] … Wimshurst's machine could, in effect, be constructed with plain glass plates and with combs in place of brushes at the ends of the diametrical conductors. [...] The initial charging could be done with the aid of an external source placed, for example, opposite and outside of [...] A1 [...]) [...] Pellissier then states that [...] "the role of the metallic sectors of the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> seems to be primarily, in effect, to facilitate its automatic starting and to reduce the influence of atmospheric humidity." [...] This machine is significantly more powerful than the sectored version, but it must usually be started with an externally applied charge.|$|E

50|$|The {{business}} {{continued to}} buy and sell scientific equipment through the 1920s, especially electrical equipment such as <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machines</b> (devices for creating a high voltage).

50|$|The <b>Wimshurst</b> {{influence}} <b>machine</b> is an electrostatic generator, {{a machine}} for generating high voltages developed between 1880 and 1883 by British inventor James Wimshurst (1832-1903).|$|R
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wimshurst {{developed}} a [...] "duplex machine". The device had two disks turning in opposite directions, with metallic conducting sectors on {{the surfaces of}} each. Compared to its predecessors, this machine was less sensitive to atmospheric conditions and did not require an electric power supply. This form of the machine was also improved by other developers (such as the Pidgeon machine developed by W. R. Pidgeon, which increased the electrical induction effect and its electrical output). In 1882, Wimshurst developed his [...] "Cylindrical Machine". By 1883, his improvements to the electrostatic generator led to the device being widely known as the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine.</b> In 1885, {{one of the largest}} Wimshurst machines was built in England (and is now at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry).|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, the Pidgeon {{machine was}} {{developed}} {{with a unique}} setup by W. R. Pidgeon. On October 28 that year, Pidgeon presented this machine to the Physical Society {{after several years of}} investigation into influence machines (beginning {{at the start of the}} decade). The device was later reported in the Philosophical Magazine (December 1898, pg. 564) and the Electrical Review (Vol. XLV, pg. 748). A Pidgeon machine possesses fixed inductors arranged in a manner that increases the electrical induction effect (and its electrical output is at least double that of typical machines of this type [...] ). The essential features of the Pidgeon machine are, one, the combination of the rotating support and the fixed support for inducing charge, and, two, the improved insulation of all parts of the machine (but more especially of the generator's carriers). Pidgeon machines are a combination of a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>Machine</b> and Voss Machine, with special features adapted to reduce the amount of charge leakage. Pidgeon machines excite themselves more readily than the best of these types of machines. In addition, Pidgeon investigated higher current [...] "triplex" [...] section machines (or [...] "double machines with a single central disk") with enclosed sectors (and went on to receive British Patent 22517 (1899) for this type of machine).|$|E

5000|$|A {{high voltage}} is not {{necessarily}} dangerous if it cannot deliver substantial current. The common static electric sparks seen under low-humidity conditions always involve voltage well above 700 V. For example, sparks to car doors in winter can involve voltages as high as 20,000 V. [...] Also, physics demonstration devices such as Van de Graaff generators and <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machines</b> can produce voltages approaching one million volts, yet at worst they deliver a brief sting. That is {{because the number of}} electrons involved is not high. These devices have a limited amount of stored energy, so the average current produced is low and usually for a short time, with impulses peaking in the amp range for a nanosecond. During the discharge, these machines apply high voltage to the body for only a millionth of a second or less. So a low-amperage current is applied for a very short time, and the number of electrons involved is very small.|$|R
5000|$|Eugène Adrien Ducretet (November 27, 1844 - 1915) was a French {{scientific}} instrument manufacturer, {{who performed}} {{some of the}} first experiments on wireless telegraphy (radio communication) in France. His father, Louis Joseph Ducretet, was a Savoy textiles merchant who moved to Paris. He never completed a formal education, leaving primary school at age 15. After several years apprenticed to Paris engineer Paul-Gustav Froment, Ducretet opened his own workshop in 1864 at 21 Rue des Ursulines where with a few employees he manufactured classical physics research, teaching and demonstration apparatus, such as galvanometers, <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machines,</b> and Crookes tubes. [...] Over time his reputation grew and he became instrument supplier to several large Paris educational and scientific institutions. [...] He was awarded a gold medal for his quality instruments at the 1878 Paris Universal Exposition and from then on his firm was a regular presence at important international expositions, winning another gold at the 1881 International Electricity Exposition in Paris. [...] He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1885.|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{theory of}} <b>Wimshurst's</b> alternating static <b>machine</b> is developed in detail {{according to the}} general method previously given by the author for other static machines. The theory predicts that the potential of any element of the machine will reverse at definite intervals {{and at the same}} time increase in value. While the exact period of reversal depends on the capacities involved in the machine, the approximate period can be calculated and is found to be the time of one revolution rather than the time of three quarters of a revolution as observed by <b>Wimshurst.</b> An actual <b>machine</b> was constructed and the reversal observed by means of the glow in discharge tubes. It was found that such a machine does reverse every revolution rather than every three quarters of a revolution. The theory given can be extended to other machines of the same type with more than four inductors. The period of reversal of a six-inductor machine is calculated to be approximately the same as that of a four-inductor machine...|$|R

50|$|In On the Changes in Resistance of Bodies under Different Electrical Conditions, he {{described}} how the electrical circuit {{was made by}} means of two narrow strips of copper parallel to the short sides of the rectangular plate, and forming good contact with it by means of screws. When the two copper strips were raised the plate was {{cut out of the}} circuit. He also used as conductors fine metallic filings, which he sometimes mixed with insulating liquids. The filings were placed in a tube of glass or ebonite, and were held between two metal plates. When the electrical circuit, consisting of a Daniell cell, a galvanometer of high resistance, and the metallic conductor, consisting of the ebonite plate, and the sheet of copper, or of the tube containing the filings, was completed, only a very small current flowed; but there was a sudden diminution of the resistance which was proved by a large deviation of the galvanometer needle when one or more electric discharges were produced in the neighbourhood of the circuit. In order to produce these discharges a small <b>Wimshurst</b> influence <b>machine</b> may be used, with or without a condenser, or a Ruhmkorff coil. The action of the electrical discharge diminishes as the distance increases; but he observed it easily, and without taking any special precautions, at a distance of several yards. By using a Wheatstone bridge, he observed this action at a distance of 20 yards, although the machine producing the sparks was working in a room separated from the galvanometer and the bridge by three large apartments, and the noise of the sparks was not audible. The changes of resistance were considerable with the conductors described. They varied, for instance, from several millions of ohms to 2000, or even to 100, from 150,000 to 500 ohms, from 50 to 35, and so on. The diminution of resistance was not momentary, and sometimes it was found to remain for twenty-four hours. Another method of making the test was, by connecting the electrodes of a capillary electrometer to the two poles of a Daniell cell with a sulphate of cadmium solution. The displacement of mercury which takes place when the cell is short-circuited, only takes place very slowly when an ebonite plate, covered with a sheet of copper of high resistance, is inserted between one of the poles of the cell, and the corresponding electrode of the electrometer; but when sparks are produced by a machine, the mercury is rapidly thrown into the capillary tube owing to the sudden diminution in the resistance of the plate.|$|R

50|$|In 1873 James Clerk Maxwell {{published}} a unified treatment {{of electricity and}} magnetism in A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism which stimulated several theorists {{to think in terms}} of fields described by Maxwell's equations. In 1878, the British inventor James Wimshurst developed an apparatus that had two glass disks mounted on two shafts. It was not till 1883 that the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> was more fully reported to the scientific community.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2010, {{the museum}} opened [...] "Science Storms" [...] in the Allstate Court, as a {{permanent}} exhibit. This multilevel exhibit features a 40 ft water vapor tornado, tsunami tank, Tesla coil, heliostat system, and a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> built by James Wimshurst in the late 19th century. Also housed are Newton's Cradle, the color spectrum, and Foucault pendulum. All artifacts allow guests to explore the physics and chemistry of the natural world.|$|E

This machine is significantly more powerful than the sectored version, but it must usually be started with an externally applied charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine is}} {{theoretically}} not self-starting, meaning that {{if none of}} the sectors on the discs has any electrical charge {{there is nothing to}} induce charges on other sectors. In practice, even a small residual charge on any sector is enough to start the process going once the discs start to rotate. The machine will only work satisfactorily in a dry atmosphere. It does require mechanical power to turn the disks against the electric field, and it is this energy that the machine converts into electric power. The steady state output of the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> is a direct (non-alternating) current that is proportional to the area covered by the metal sector, the rotation speed, and a complicated function of the initial charge distribution. The insulation {{and the size of the}} machine determine the maximum output voltage that can be reached. The accumulated spark energy can be increased by adding a pair of Leyden jars, an early type of capacitor suitable for high voltages, with the jars’ inner plates independently connected to each of the output terminals and the jars’ outer plates interconnected. A typical <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> can produce sparks that are about a third of the disc's diameter in length and several tens of microamperes.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> the two {{insulated}} discs {{and their}} metal sectors rotate {{in opposite directions}} passing the crossed metal neutralizer bars and their brushes. An imbalance of charges is induced, amplified, and collected by two pairs of metal combs with points placed near the surfaces of each disk. These collectors are mounted on insulating supports and connected to the output terminals. The positive feedback increases the accumulating charges exponentially until the dielectric breakdown voltage of the air is reached and an electric spark jumps across the gap.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the Institute was the Burndy Library on the ground floor, {{initially}} containing 37,000 volumes on the history of science and technology collected by the Dibner Fund. The Library also possessed a large collection of antique scientific instruments, such as astrolabes, telescopes, microscopes, early spectrometers, and a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> which were on public display in a dedicated gallery outside the library. Also on display was a large collection of antique incandescent light bulbs, gas discharge tubes, electronic vacuum tubes, and other early examples of electrical and electronic technology. The Library would mount occasional special exhibits, such as The Afterlife of Immortality: Obelisks Outside Egypt.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{contra-rotating}} insulating discs (usually made of glass) have {{a number}} of metal sectors stuck onto them. The machine is provided with four small earthed brushes (two {{on each side of the}} machine on conducting shafts at 90° to each other), plus a pair of charge-collection combs. The conducting shafts, that hold the brushes on a typical <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> would form the shape of an [...] "X", if one could see through the insulating disks, as they are perpendicular to each other. The charge-collection combs are typically mounted along the horizontal and equally contact the outer edges of both front and back discs. The collection combs on each side are usually connected to respective Leyden jars.|$|E

From the late 1970s, he operated {{from his home in}} Cantley, Norfolk. Towards the end of his life, he built several detailed reconstructions of early electrical devices including a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> and Edison phonograph. He was honoured by the University of East Anglia for constructing a working replica of apparatus used by Heinrich Hertz, but it seems that none of this equipment, the Chromasonics apparatus or his experimental music-making machinery has survived.

5000|$|In 1948, Karplus married Elizabeth Frazier, {{whom he had}} met at an {{international}} folk dance group he organized while at Harvard. They had seven children born between 1950 and 1962. When the oldest child, Beverly, was 7, Karplus accepted her invitation to present a science lesson on electricity to her third-grade class, using the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> he had inherited from his grandfather. Unfortunately, while the children enjoyed the demonstration, the lesson was a conceptual disaster. This stimulated Karplus {{to think about how}} to teach science better, and as the other children entered school, he continued to visit their classes on a [...] "show and tell" [...] basis with various science experiments or demonstrations. Conversing with his children and their classmates, he became increasingly interested in children's learning, reasoning, and science concept development.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{circular}} capacitor B, 7.7 cm in diameter, {{built from}} {{multiple layers of}} mica and tinfoil, was fitted into a smooth spherical celluloid ball D that was covered with conductive paint, and which was suspended by a fine phosphor-bronze wire 37 cm long within a grounded tube. The wire was connected to one electrode of a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> which kept alternate plates of the capacitor charged to 3000 volts. The opposite plates of the capacitor {{as well as the}} celluloid ball were kept at ground voltage by means of a platinum wire that dipped into a sulfuric acid bath that not only served as a conductive electrode, but also damped oscillations and acted as a desiccant. A mirror attached to the capacitor was viewed through a telescope and allowed fine changes in orientation to be viewed.|$|E
50|$|Other {{classical}} electrostatic machines like a <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine</b> or a Bonetti machine {{can easily}} produce more current than a Van de Graaff generator for experiments with electrostatics and have {{positive and negative}} outputs. For these generators, however, corona discharge from exposed metal parts at high potentials and poorer insulation result in smaller voltages. In an electrostatic generator, the rate of charge transported (current) to the high-voltage electrode is very small, so the maximal voltage is obtained when the leakage current from the electrode equals the rate of charge transport. In the Van de Graaff generator, the belt allows the transport of charge into {{the interior of a}} large hollow spherical electrode. This is the ideal shape to minimize leakage and corona discharge, so the Van de Graaff generator can produce the greatest voltage. This is why the Van de Graaff design has been used for all electrostatic particle accelerators.|$|E
5000|$|Electrostatic induction, {{also known}} as [...] "electrostatic influence" [...] or simply [...] "influence" [...] in Europe and Latin America, is a {{redistribution}} of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges. [...] In {{the presence of a}} charged body, an insulated conductor develops a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. [...] Induction was discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762. [...] Electrostatic generators, such as the <b>Wimshurst</b> <b>machine,</b> the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle. Due to induction, the electrostatic potential (voltage) is constant at any point throughout a conductor. Electrostatic Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light nonconductive objects, such as balloons, paper or styrofoam scraps, to static electric charges. Electrostatic induction laws apply in dynamic situations as far as the quasistatic approximation is valid. Electrostatic induction {{should not be confused with}} Electromagnetic induction.|$|E
