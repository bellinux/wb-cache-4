60|$|Let us end {{by showing}} how this {{discussion}} illustrates {{the method of}} Folklore. <b>We</b> have <b>found</b> anomalies among Aryans. We have seen the gens an odd, decaying institution. We have seen Greek families claim descent from various animals, said to be Zeus in disguise. <b>We</b> have <b>found</b> them tracing kinship and deriving names from the mother. <b>We</b> have <b>found</b> stocks with animal and vegetable names. <b>We</b> have <b>found</b> half-brothers and sisters marrying. We have noted prohibition to marry anyone of the same family name. All these institutions are odd, anomalous, decaying things among Aryans, and the more civilised the Aryans the more they decay. All of them are living, active things among savages, and, far from being anomalous, are in precise harmony with savage notions of the world. Surely, then, where they seem decaying and anomalous, as among Aryans, these customs and laws are mouldering relics of ideas and practices natural and inevitable among savages.|$|R
