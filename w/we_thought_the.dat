500|$|The Millers {{began the}} game's {{development}} by sketching out puzzles and each individual world the player would explore in the game. As the brothers were conceptualizing the various worlds, they also wrote down {{pieces of the}} story. At {{some point in the}} development of these bits of story, Robyn explained in an interview, [...] "We started realizing this story is actually something <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> public would enjoy, so we started pressing to make [...] happen." [...] Buoyed by strong sales of the video game, publisher Hyperion signed a three-novel, US$1million deal with the brothers.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I {{was really}} surprised, {{because we thought}} we were {{creating}} the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". Mike Dann, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of Sesame Street. Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, [...] "After he [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".|$|E
500|$|Soon after Sesame Street {{debuted in}} the USA, the CTW was asked {{independently}} by producers from several countries to produce {{versions of the}} series in their countries. Cooney remarked, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because {{we thought we were}} creating the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who quit commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries. In response to Dann's appointment, television critic Marvin Kitman said, [...] "After [...] sells [...] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV". This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the series. [...] By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term [...] "co-productions".|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from several countries all around the world approached the Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization responsible for the show's production, to create and produce versions of Sesame Street in their countries. [...] Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, [...] "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created".

2500|$|In November 2010 it was {{announced}} that all-rounder Mohammad Nabi would captain Afghanistan in the 2010 Asian Games twenty20 tournament in China later that month. The Afghanistan Cricket Board released a statement that [...] "We have played 16 one-day internationals but we could only win nine therefore <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> burden of captaincy is too heavy on Nawroz and Nabi is the next best choice". After causing an upset by beating Pakistan in the semi-finals of the games, Afghanistan lost the final to Bangladesh and finished with a silver medal.|$|E
2500|$|British label Relentless Records {{put forward}} an {{independent}} offer. However, Tunstall {{had decided to}} sign with a US major, and initially passed up the offer. But when that deal did not work out, {{she decided to go}} with Relentless. Although Relentless co-founder Shabs Jobanputra recognised the potential in the quality of Tunstall's voice and songs in the early 2000s, his assessment then was that she [...] "wasn't ready yet" [...] and so together with Tunstall's manager, Jobanputra discussed [...] "the process of how we saw her happening and how we would work, why <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> songs were great, why we thought she was great, and why it could really work if we took enough time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harrison {{spent two}} years {{on and off the}} {{practice}} squad for the Steelers, being released three times, and also was briefly on the active roster {{towards the end of the}} 2002 season, playing only special teams. [...] Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply [...] "give up" [...] on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, [...] "He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays. We'd be in practice, in training camp, and he might not know what he was doing so he'd just stop and throw his hands up and tell (the coaches) to get him out of there. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> guy was crazy." ...|$|E

Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo both point to [...] "Under Covers", the eighth episode of that season, as the catalyst for the flirtation between the characters. The episode involves Tony and Ziva being sent undercover as a married couple, an assignment that requires them to simulate sexual relations in order to solidify their cover. De Pablo commented, [...] "Michael and I talked about all of those scenes right before we did them. We had a totally different way of looking at it. In our minds, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> characters weren't faking anything. They just got carried away. Then all of the sudden after that, they saw each other in a different light."

2500|$|Porter was {{initially}} organized {{as a private}} company. On April 16, 2010, Porter Aviation Holdings announced {{they were going to}} be listed as a publicly traded company. The company filed a preliminary prospectus — a business plan — with securities commissions across the country, a requirement before it can offer shares. The company has $306 million of debt and leases and intended to raise $120 million of new shares in the company and order seven new Q400 planes. However, after twice delaying the final deadline for the offering, and lowering its share price from between $6 and $7 per share to $5.50, Porter cancelled the initial public offering. According to Robert Deluce [...] "We came to the conclusion that it was really prudent to defer the offering at this time and to wait until better market conditions existed. We wanted to raise some capital. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> IPO was the way to go, but we weren't prepared in any way to sell our stock at just any price." ...|$|E

2500|$|Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{commented on}} the most {{significant}} area of disagreement regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from [...] "the" [...] territories or from [...] "all" [...] territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning [...] "the." [...] We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Israeli border along the West Bank could be [...] "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take {{a fresh look at}} the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel {{as a result of the}} June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.|$|E
