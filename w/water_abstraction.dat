In order to preserve and improve the aquatic ecosystems it is therefore necessary to maintain adequate quantity and quality of water in watercourses, which can be ensured by providing ecologically acceptable flow (EAF). In Slovenia, a large diversity of watercourses regarding their hydrologic, morphological and ecological characteristics dictates the determination of EAF separately for individual sections of watercourses. Since 1994, the determination of EAF in Slovenia has been carried out primarily for the existing <b>water</b> <b>abstractions</b> such as hydroelectric power plants, fish farms, {{and to a lesser extent}} for the <b>abstractions</b> for drinking <b>water,</b> process water, recreation facilities and at the outflows from reservoirs. The results of EAF value analyses showed that the EAF values for individual <b>water</b> <b>abstractions</b> differed widely both with respect to the values of the mean annual minimum flow and the values of the mean annual flow. The results of analyses support the basis for the determination of EAF used in most EU countries, namely that EAF must be determined through interdisciplinary approach where the hydrologic data represent the benchmark values for the determination of EAF...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThermoelectric {{generation}} {{contributes to}} 80 % of global electricity production. Cooling of thermoelectric plants is often achieved by <b>water</b> <b>abstractions</b> {{from the natural}} environment. In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all <b>water</b> <b>abstractions</b> and 40 % of non-tidal surface <b>water</b> <b>abstractions.</b> We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector {{and use it to}} test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37 – 107 %), and a consumptive intensity that is 30 – 69 % higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148 – 399 %. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply...|$|R

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>abstractions</b> for {{irrigation}} purposes {{are higher than}} for any other pan-European water use sector and have a large influence on river runoff regimes. This modelling experiment assesses historic and current irrigation water demands for different crops in five arc minute spatial resolution for pan-Europe. Two different modelling frameworks have been applied in this study. First, soft-coupling the dynamic vegetation model LPJmL with the land use model LandSHIFT leads to overestimations of national irrigation water demands, which are rather high in the southern Mediterranean countries. This {{can be explained by}} unlimited water supply in the model structure and illegal or not gauged <b>water</b> <b>abstractions</b> in the reported data sets. The second modelling framework is WaterGAP 3, which has an integrated conceptual crop specific irrigation module. Irrigation water requirements as modelled with WaterGAP 3 feature a more realistic representation of pan-European water withdrawals. However, in colder humid regions, irrigation water demands are often underestimated. Additionally, a national database on crop-specific irrigated area and water withdrawal for all 42 countries within pan-Europe has been set up and integrated in both model frameworks...|$|R

25|$|Irrigation canals are {{classified}} into principal canals (Rayah), main canals (first level canals), branch canals (second level canals), distribution canals (Mesqas, or third level canals) and irrigation ditches (Merwas). Flow in {{the principal and}} main canals is continuous; in the branch and distribution canals it is on a rotation basis. However, the government supports a process of converting some of the lower-level canals gradually to continuous flow. Farmers pump water from the mesqas to irrigate fields (lift: about 0.5-1.5 m). A Mesqa typically serves an area of 50 to 200 feddan (20 to 80 hectares). In areas {{where there is no}} formal operational structure for proper water distribution, the tail-end users usually are not getting enough water to maintain crops. Water user associations have been formed beginning in the 1990s to better distribute water among farmers on a mesqa and to rationalize pumping, with the aim of reducing <b>water</b> <b>abstraction,</b> pumping costs and to increase yields.|$|E

The city asked the club in 1999 to start looking for another site for a water aerodrome.

Urban tariffs are differentiated by locality, by the quantity consumed, and by the type of use (residential, public, commercial and industrial). Urban tariff review mechanisms vary furthermore depending on whether the service provider is private or public, the process for the latter being more complicated and cumbersome than for the former. In general, the level of urban water tariffs is high compared to other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, making it hard to afford to the urban poor connected to the piped network. On the other hand, it is insufficient to allow for full cost recovery. 11% of all users, including a large share of poor users in both urban and rural areas, receive water for free from standpipes.|$|E

Ice-breaking was stopped in 1857, and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal. In 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night, and, in 1865, boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss.
