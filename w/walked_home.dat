5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, <b>walked</b> <b>home</b> early. Parsons spoke {{for almost an hour}} before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and <b>walked</b> <b>home,</b> along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E

He was later dismissed for gross misconduct.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, the Blacket {{family moved}} to a rented house in Glebe.

25|$|Patten was {{commissioned}} a first lieutenant in Captain John Caldwell's 2nd Company of the 1st Delaware Regiment {{at the beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War. He was soon promoted to captain of the 1st Company and in February 1779 and was promoted to the rank of major. He fought in every major battle from the Battle of Long Island until the Battle of Camden, where the Delaware Regiment suffered grievous losses, and he was taken prisoner. Paroled in 1781, after the fighting was over, he is said to have <b>walked</b> <b>home</b> alone in rags from Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
500|$|Trenchard {{had many}} reasons for not {{accepting}} any of the posts which he saw as being artificially created, of little value or lacking authority. [...] On 8 May Trenchard {{was sitting on a}} bench in Green Park and overheard one naval officer saying to another [...] "I don't know why the Government should pander to a man who threw in his hand at the height of a battle. [...] If I'd my way with Trenchard I'd have him shot." [...] After Trenchard had <b>walked</b> <b>home,</b> he wrote to Weir accepting command of the as yet unformed Independent Force.|$|E

He noticed three youths hovering several yards away {{on the opposite side of}} the street. When they approached him he was ready. [...] "Give us your money, or you'll get hurt" [...] said the leader of the three. Abbe looked at each one in turn, then casually took his wallet out of his jacket pocket, throwing it on the floor between himself and the antagonists. He pointed to the wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?" [...] The three would-be attackers looked at the wallet on the floor, then at Abbe and then at each other and then moved away. Abbe picked up his wallet and calmly <b>walked</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
500|$|Rachel Chiesley {{was one of}} ten {{children}} born to John Chiesley of Dalry and Margaret Nicholson. The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for aliment. She was awarded 1,700 merks by Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath, the Lord President of the Court of Session. Furious with the result, [...] John Chiesley shot Lockhart dead on the High Street of Edinburgh as he <b>walked</b> <b>home</b> from church on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1689. He {{made no attempt to}} escape and confessed at his trial, held before the Lord Provost the next day. Two days later he was taken from the Tolbooth to the Mercat Cross on the High Street. His right hand was cut off before he was hanged, and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed around his neck. Rachel Chiesley's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then, making her about ten {{years old at the time}} of her father's execution.|$|E
500|$|In April 2001, Toyah was {{the focus}} of one of Coronation Streets most {{controversial}} storylines. After enjoying a night out with her friend Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah was raped, beaten and left for dead in an alleyway by an unknown assailant as she <b>walked</b> <b>home</b> alone. The storyline began during a special 45-minute episode that was broadcast during the Easter weekend. It marked the first time in forty years that Coronation Street had included a rape. Viewers saw Toyah being grabbed by her attacker, but not the actual act of rape. Instead Toyah's [...] "bruised body" [...] was found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) just as he set out for an early morning run. Jason took a [...] "traumatised" [...] Toyah back to her house, where she told her mother what had happened. Toyah then had to repeat the story to the police and revealed that she did not know who raped her because she was semi-conscious during the attack. Toyah underwent an examination and counselling at the local hospital. The scenes were shot at the St Mary's Hospital Sexual Assault Centre in Manchester, where the writers spent four months researching victims' experiences and working with the clinical director and the staff to get the scenario right.|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Watt was Grimball's mother, so {{running a}} school came {{naturally}} for him. After her husband died, {{she began her}} school in 1931 in {{the depth of the}} Great Depression. Her first classes were held in the dining room of her Broad Street home, but she had a small classroom building constructed at the rear of her property.

Many of her graduates went on to the Gaud School, particularly after Grimball became headmaster there. Most of the children walked to school and then <b>walked</b> <b>home</b> for the traditional 2:00p.m. dinner. It was a homey and welcoming school and very “Charlestonian.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Gonzalez' sons, Ambrose and Narciso, became notable journalists. In 1891, they founded The State, a {{newspaper}} in Columbia, South Carolina. Narciso waged a crusade against Benjamin [...] "Pitchfork Ben" [...] Tillman, a U.S. Senator and former Governor of South Carolina, and his nephew and heir apparent, Lt. Governor James H. Tillman, in his newspaper, helping ensure the younger Tillman's defeat in the 1902 South Carolina governor's race. On January 15, 1903, Narciso was shot by James H. Tillman (nephew of Benjamin) and died four days later. A memorial cenotaph for Narciso was later erected on Senate Street across from the State House in Columbia, purportedly on the route Tillman regularly <b>walked</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
