40|$|If an {{annealed}} crystal of AgCl, doped {{with a few}} {{parts per}} million of divalent cation (Cd 2 + or Mn 2 +) and kept under yellow safelight, is dissolved in a very <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> (10 % aqueous NaCl), {{it is found that}} during the first minute some 150 to 250 Å is removed. Subsequent etchings in fresh solutions, however, remove only much smaller (often by a factor of 4) amounts. Ageing the crystal overnight at room temperature, in either air or dry nitrogen, restores the original behaviour : once again, the first 200 Å is rapidly dissolved, after which the rate drops considerably. It is proposed that the rapidly dissolving region is that of the ionic space charge, which compensates the negative surface charge. Consistent with this model are the facts that : (a) ageing at liquid nitrogen temperature does not restore the rapid initial dissolution; (b) the effect is much smaller for undoped crystals (containing ~ 1 ppm divalent cation); (c) the diffusion range of the divalent solute during a period of the order of 20 hrs. at room temperature is of the same magnitude as the thickness of the space charge region. Also of interest is the observation that actinic light, which produces free photoelectrons, enhances the rate of dissolution in a <b>weak</b> <b>solvent...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Glycerol, when {{utilized}} in a passive non-critical fashion, such as with tincturing, {{is generally considered}} a <b>weaker</b> <b>solvent</b> than either water or ethanol. It is nearly as polar as water, and a larger molecule than either water or ethanol. The same intermolecular forces that cause glycerol to be relatively thick, viscous, and dense at low temperatures, decrease its overall ability to passively extract and dissolve molecules from medicinal raw materials. When {{utilized in}} a traditional passive tincture method glycerites tend to result in much weaker than simple ethanol extracts. In addition, glycerol extracts specific kinds and amounts of chemical compounds. This behavior in a non-critical/non-dynamic state is primarily determined by glycerols polarity, hydrogen bonding characteristics, and intermolecular forces, all of which determine its rate of mass transfer.|$|R

Measurements are reported for exposure between 400 C and 1000 C in water, methanol and xylene and using an applied pressure of 200 bar (3000 psi). The changes in the physical properties of the hose were monitored by measurement of the tensile properties, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and gravimetric uptake of the fluids. Significant changes occur immediately on application of pressure and reflect changes in crystallinity. The rates and extent of the modifications depend primarily on the ageing temperature but is also influenced by the fluid.

Furthermore some of the samples have been investigated by microchemical analysis, spectral analysis, and electron microprobe analysis. Spectral analysis has also been carried out on separates from selected samples. The total amount of Cu present in the samples has been determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present the results of studying a two-step gradient SMB process using a weaker solvent to introduce the feed and a stronger solvent for efficient adsorbent regeneration. A mathematical model for the simulation of this process was proposed and solved numerically. Systematic calculations were performed in order to identify suitable operating conditions as a function of averaged desorbent concentrations taking into account the locally changing nonlinear adsorption equilibria. Based on the predictions and on preliminary experimental investigations devoted to determine the required model parameters the separation of a mixture of two cycloketons using normal-phase silica was designed. A two- step gradient SMB process was applied using pure n-hexane as the <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> in the feed stream and pure ethyl acetate as the strong solvent in the desorbent stream. The achieved purities and concentrations in the raffinate and extract streams confirmed the potential of the gradient technique applied.

Through one port, the feed is supplied whereas through the next port, eluent with increasing modifier concentration is dosed. In this work, the principle was studied for a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography system using the separation of a binary mixture of two cycloketones as an example. In these experiments, four columns were used. The feed stream was introduced in a relatively <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> and then three gradient steps using stronger solvents followed. In order to study the concept quantitatively, a mathematical model describing the column dynamics was developed. In preliminary experiments, the most relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the chromatographic system have been determined.

40|$|A new {{combination}} of four organic solvents is {{proposed for the}} optimization of TLC separations of basic drugs and alkaloids. The solvents are diethylamine (DEA), methanol (MeOH), chloroform (CHCl 3) and ethylacetate (EtAc). They were selected from a collection of ten solvents used in Normal Phase TLC mobile phases recommended for the separation of alkaloids and basic drugs in the literature. The selection {{was based on the}} classification of solvents according to selectivity and solubility parameters. Excluded were apolar and <b>weak</b> <b>solvents</b> that show no selective (polar) properties and are used only for the adjustment of the solvent strength. Polar solvents from different selectivity groups were selected to combine as many as possible selective effects in one solvent system. The final choice was made considering the displacement theory for Liquid Solid Chromatography. The four solvents have been intended for application in an optimization procedure that uses mixture designs and response surface modelling. The factor space is a tetrahedron of which only in a part suitable experiments can be performed, i. e. the design space. Experimentation in the design space should allow the simultaneous optimization of solvent strength and solvent selectivity. The quality of TL chromatograms was characterized by two criteria: the separation of the worst separated pair of spots (R(s) min) and the R(f) value of the slowest moving spot (kmax). In this way it is possible to influence not only the separation of the spots but also their place on the TL plate. The new four solvent system has been tested successfully in the separation of the parent alkaloids of four dry plant materials: Ipecacuanha root, Cinchona bark, Belladonna leaf and Opium.

Predominantly the classical 4 -zone process was used which operates under isocratic conditions keeping the main process parameters constant. Recently more sophisticated operating regimes have been suggested varying certain parameters during the process (e. g. VariCol, PowerFeed and ModiCon). Another significant improvement of the classical SMB process can be achieved based on establishing in the different zones of the unit different elution strengths. The most simple of these gradient SMB processes applies a two 2 -step-gradient by introducing the feed in a <b>weaker</b> <b>solvent</b> compared to the desorbent. Using this concept the overall amount of solvent can be reduced and more concentrated product streams can be obtained. Due to the large flexibility regarding an adjustment of retention times the 2 -step-gradient-SMB process appears to be in particular attractive to perform bioseparations. In this presentation results of the two case studies will be presented. At first as a model system the separation of bovine IgG from lysozyme and/or BSA will be analyzed. Then the separation of the active dimeric form of the bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) from its inactive monomeric form will be investigated. BMP- 2 {{is one of the most}} interesting of several BMPs which belong to the transforming-growth-factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily.

It is known that catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) waste can produce liquid fuels with similar properties to fossil fuels, hence serve {{as a solution to}} the problems mentioned. However, the problem of pipelines clogging by molten plastic feed during the cracking process has to be solved before the process can be up-scaled to continuous process. It was proposed that LDPE waste can be dissolved in suitable solvent before being catalytically cracked under suitable conditions. Previously, a study was done to investigate on dissolution of virgin LDPE (in pellet form) and waste LDPE (in film form) in different solvents [1]. This study was done to investigate the behavior of virgin LDPE (in powder form) dissolved in several chosen solvents, namely benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, isooctane, xylene and trichloroethylene, and compare the result with previous work. From the study, it was observed that LDPE samples could dissolve in benzene and toluene to a high extent. On the other hand, isooctane acted as a <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> towards LDPE powder. The difference of LDPE solubility in solvents was attributed to the surface area per unit mass of LDPE samples. Despite the superior property of benzene as solvent for LDPE, the safety factor study showed that toluene, xylene and trichloroethylene were more suitable to be used in LDPE dissolution.

40|$|The solvent {{composition}} was adjusted in {{a theoretical}} study {{in order to}} maximize the efficiency of a simulated moving bed process. The isocratic realization of the process as well as the solvent gradient mode were considered. The solvent composition and the flow rates were used as decision variables in a random search optimization algorithm known to be a reliable tool for nonlinear programming problems. The results of the optimization indicate that the optimal composition of the mobile phase depends strongly on the feed concentration. The asymmetry of the internal concentration profiles, which {{have a negative effect on}} the separation efficiency, can be partly damped by an increase of the solvent strength. In the cases studied the optimal solvent strength determined for concentrated feed streams is higher than that for diluted ones. Moreover, the optimum is strongly influenced by the value of the selectivity factor and its dependency on the mobile phase composition. Different results were obtained for cases in which the separation factor increases with increasing the modifier concentration, than for cases, in which the separation factor decreases with increasing the modifier concentration. A similar analysis was performed for a solvent gradient SMB process using different solvents at the two inlet ports: a <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> in the feed stream and a strong solvent in the desorbent stream. Again the optimal mobile phase composition was strongly affected by the type of the isotherms and their non-linearity.

40|$|The {{relaxation}} {{dynamics of}} the indoline dye D 149, a well-known sensitizer for photoelectrochemical solar cells, have been extensively characterized in various organic solvents by combining results from ultrafast pump–supercontinuum probe (PSCP) spectroscopy, transient UV-pump VIS-probe spectroscopy, time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) measurements as well as steady-state absorption and fluorescence. In the steady-state spectra, {{the position of the}} absorption maximum shows only a <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> dependence, whereas the fluorescence Stokes shift Δ[small nu, Greek, tilde]F correlates with solvent polarity. Photoexcitation at around 480 nm provides access to the S 1 state of D 149 which exhibits solvation dynamics on characteristic timescales, as monitored by a red-shift of the stimulated emission and spectral development of the excited-state absorption in the transient PSCP spectra. In all cases, the spectral dynamics can be modeled by a global kinetic analysis using a time-dependent S 1 spectrum. The lifetime τ 1 of the S 1 state roughly correlates with polarity [acetonitrile (280 ps) < acetone (540 ps) < THF (720 ps) < chloroform (800 ps) ], yet in alcohols it is much shorter [methanol (99 ps) < ethanol (178 ps) < acetonitrile (280 ps) ], suggesting an appreciable influence of hydrogen bonding on the dynamics. A minor component with a characteristic time constant in the range 19 – 30 ps, readily observed in the PSCP spectra of D 149 in acetonitrile and THF, is likely due to removal of vibrational excess energy from the S 1 state by collisions with solvent molecules. Additional weak fluorescence in the range 390 – 500 nm is observed upon excitation in the S 0 → S 2 band, which contains short-lived S 2 → S 0 emission of D 149. Transient absorption signals after excitation at 377. 5 nm yield an additional time constant in the subpicosecond range, representing the lifetime of the S 2 state. S 2 excitation also produces photoproducts...|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{the closest}} {{chemical}} analog to water, but is less polar and a <b>weaker</b> inorganic <b>solvent.</b> Hydrogen sulfide is quite plentiful on Jupiter's moon Io, and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface; and astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch has suggested it as a possible solvent for life there. On a planet with hydrogen-sulfide oceans {{the source of the}} hydrogen sulfide could come from volcanos, in which case it could be mixed in with a bit of hydrogen fluoride, which could help dissolve minerals. Hydrogen sulfide life might use a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They might produce and live off of sulfur monoxide, which is analogous to oxygen (O2). Hydrogen sulfide, like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, suffers from the small temperature range where it is liquid, though that, like that of hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, increases with increasing pressure.|$|R

The approach {{is based on the}} use of the Hildebrand Solubility Parameter, and its individual parameters of hydrogen bonding, dispersion and polarity to select <b>weak</b> and strong <b>solvents</b> to extract POP's from soil matrices. The approach has been applied to both spiked soils and certified reference materials.

The infrared spectrum and luminescent properties of Cd (II) complex material {{have also been}} studied. The infrared spectrum shows that the Cd (II) ion forms stable complex with 1 -acetyl- 2 -naphthol- 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenyl ether. The results of fluorescence analysis indicate that the Cd (II) complex emit blue-green fluorescence in solid, however, the fluorescence is very <b>weak</b> in organic <b>solvents.</b> The results can guide the design and synthesis of new luminescent complex materials in the future...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This work {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the adsorption/deposition of asphaltene clusters and nanoaggregates in a porous medium, under flow conditions and at high pressures. It also explores the strategies to reduce or prevent the adsorption/deposition. Asphaltenes are highly aromatic and heavy fractions present in crude oil. Their adsorption or deposition causes problems during production due to clogging of the pore structure of the rock as well as subsequently fouling downstream piping and fittings. The porous medium {{used in this study}} is 140 mesh silica (100 micron) packed into an HPLC (high performance liquid chromatograph) column through which dilute solutions of asphaltenes in a <b>weak</b> <b>solvent</b> (toluene and tetradecane 50 % by wt.) are pumped. Langmuir isotherms fit well to the adsorption results. Saturation asphaltene adsorption (Γmax) of about 1250 mg/m 2 is obtained for silica particles. To reduce or prevent such deposition, silica surface is modified using HTAB (hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide), HMDS (Hexamethyldisiloxane) and OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane) to form a protective layer. Subsequent HPLC studies indicate that the saturation asphaltene adsorption on the treated silica has been reduced to 909. 10 mg/m 2, 833. 33 mg/m 2 and 588. 23 mg/m 2 respectively. To investigate the effects of adsorption/deposition on the porosity of the silica column, dilute solution of a high molecular weight asphaltene mimic, SEPTON 4099, in a similar solvent is pumped through the column under high pressure. Adsorption/deposition is monitored by changes in the pressure required to sustain a given flow rate, which is analyzed to give the resulting change in bed porosity, as deduced using Ergun analysis. Adlayer of thickness up to 3. 6 μm is found to develop over a period of 60 hours. To reduce or prevent such deposition, the silica is pre-treated with HTAB to form a protective layer. Subsequent HPLC studies indicate that the polymer adsorption on the treated silica has been reduced to less than 50 %...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} theory {{for a long}} polymer rod {{immersed}} in a nematic environment and find {{the effects of a}} nematic solvent on small fluctuations of the tangent vector perpendicular to the rod axis. We are thus able to calculate the physically interesting properties associated with our combined polymer and nematic system. These include tangent-tangent correlation functions and the scattering structure factor, which reproduces known qualitative experimental results rather well. As one biological application of our model, we analyze the possible effects of a <b>weak</b> nematic <b>solvent</b> on the mechanical properties of individual hemoglobin fibers. As another biological application, we model the effects of a strong nematic environment, provided by fd. virus, on the elastic and conformational properties of wormlike micelles. The work presented here can be viewed as constituting a microscopic model derivation of previous, more phenomenologically inspired, theories that deal with similar polymer/nematic systems. Interestingly, we find that a simple boundary condition of the nematic order at the rod surface agrees well with available experimental data...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} hemicyanine dimers, (B 3, B 5, and B 12) whose two chromophores are linked by {{different}} numbers of methylene groups, are synthesized. Negative slovatochromic behaviors are observed, and the fluorescence quantum yield {{is sensitive to}} the polarity of solvent. In chloroform, the fluorescence intensity is much more intensive than in other polar solvents, and the decay lifetime is much longer. This fluorescence sensitivity to solvent {{is due to the}} twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state formation, which can be blocked in <b>weak</b> polar <b>solvent.</b> The two chromophores in one dimer molecule are correlated and the TICT formation of dimer is relatively difficult compared with monomer. When the linkage is long enough, this correlation can be reduced. The dynamic fluorescence spectra of the chloroform solutions of these dyes support our assumption. The time-resolved fluorescence studies of their LB films provide a new perspective on the excited-state deactive process. The two-dimensional Förster energy transfer between the chromphores within monolayer is assumed {{to play an important role}} of their excited states in these LB samples. The difference of the proportions of energy transfer is supposed to be the responsible for the difference of their photoelectro conversion efficiencies. 1...|$|R

A small number of epidemiological studies have shown statistically significant but <b>weak</b> associations between <b>solvent</b> exposure, systemic sclerosis, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease. However, the interpretation of these positive findings is tempered {{by a lack of}} replication, an inability to specify which solvents convey risk, and an absence of increasing risk with increasing exposure. Existing studies, on aggregate, do not show conclusively that solvents (either as a group of chemicals or individual chemicals) are causally associated with any connective tissue disease. Further investigations should be carried out to replicate the positive existing findings and to specify the solvents and circumstances of exposure that carry risk...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} an efficient solvation model for proteins. In this model atomic solvation parameters imitating the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} membrane, water, and <b>weak</b> polar <b>solvent</b> (octanol) were developed. An optimal number of solvation parameters was chosen based on analysis of atomic hydrophobicities and fitting experimental free energies of gas-cyclohexane, gas-water, and octanol-water transfer for amino acids. The solvation energy term incorporated into the ECEPP/ 2 potential energy function was tested in Monte Carlo simulations {{of a number of}} small peptides with known energies of bilayer-water and octanol-water transfer. The calculated properties were shown to agree reasonably well with the experimental data. Furthermore, the solvation model was used to assess membrane-promoting α-helix formation. To accomplish this, all-atom models of 20 -residue homopolypeptides—poly-Leu, poly-Val, poly-Ile, and poly-Gly in initial random coil conformation—were subjected to nonrestrained Monte Carlo conformational search in vacuo and with the solvation terms mimicking the water and hydrophobic parts of the bilayer. All the peptides demonstrated their largest helix-forming tendencies in a nonpolar environment, where the lowest-energy conformers of poly-Leu, Val, Ile revealed 100, 95, and 80 % of α-helical content, respectively. Energetic and conformational properties of Gly in all environments were shown to be different from those observed for residues with hydrophobic side chains. Applications of the solvation model to simulations of peptides and proteins in the presence of membrane, along with limitations of the approach, are discussed...|$|R
