500|$|In the mid-1970s, Bakshi, who {{had since}} {{achieved}} {{box office success}} producing adult-oriented animated films such as Fritz the Cat, learned of UA and Boorman's attempts to adapt the story. He was told that Boorman had planned to produce all three parts of The Lord of the Rings as a single film, and commented, [...] "I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman's part. Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to tamper with anything Tolkien did?" [...] When Boorman's proposed adaptation fell apart, Bakshi approached the studio and proposed that he direct a three-part animated film adaptation of the book: ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 28, 2008, Beghe posted online {{a letter}} to Church leader David Miscavige, {{requesting}} the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions. In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. And yet they maintain these files about what people have said to them in private sessions. Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> these people to hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Nine, Yeston left his {{position}} as associate professor at Yale, although he continued to teach a course there every other semester on songwriting. [...] He turned to writing a musical version of Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera. [...] He was approached with the idea by actor/director Geoffrey Holder, who held the American rights to the novel. [...] Initially, Yeston was skeptical of the project. [...] "I laughed and laughed.... That's the worst idea in the world! [...] Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to write a musical based on a horror story?.... And then {{it occurred to me}} that the story could be somewhat changed.... would be a Quasimodo character, an Elephant Man.

[...] Liu Rengong's attempts to aid Liu Shouwen were unsuccessful, and the city was soon running out of food, causing the people to resort to eating dirt or cannibalizing each other.

[...] Later in the year, after hearing news that Ding Hui the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) had submitted to Li Keyong, Zhu prepared to withdraw from Cang Prefecture. [...] As Zhu had had much food supply shipped to the front, he was ordering that the food supply be burned or sunk into the water. [...] Liu Shouwen wrote Zhu: ...|$|E
