In the meantime, we were projecting a series of slides which came from the Verbal American Landscape. Those had been chosen by me--I didn't do the photography; Ivan and Stewart Brand did the photography. We borrowed some closed-circuit television equipment, so there were television images. We were able to switch the whole thing. There <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> costume--it was a very elaborate affair.|$|E
25|$|The Corrupted Blood {{incident}} {{was described as}} a fascinating yet accidental case study of modeling disease origins and control at the Games for Health conference in Baltimore, Maryland by Gamasutra. They compared it to a real-life epidemic, in that it originated in a remote, uninhabited region and was carried by travelers to larger regions; hosts were both human and animal, comparing it to the avian flu; was passed through close contact; and there <b>were</b> <b>people,</b> <b>in</b> this case non-playable characters, who could contract it but were asymptomatic. However, there were elements that differed from a real-world epidemic, including an indicator for carriers that they have the disease and how much risk they are at, which cannot be done in the real world. One aspect of the epidemic that was not considered by epidemiologists in their models was curiosity, describing how players would rush into infected areas to witness the infection and then rush out. This was paralleled to real-world behavior, specifically with how journalists would cover an incident, and then leave the area.|$|E
500|$|On 13 May 2002, [...] "Without You" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single. It peaked at number eight in Australia, but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, only spending five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had [...] "a very small cache of recorded material stored away", including [...] "Without You". [...] "Without You" [...] was followed by [...] "Luv Your Life", which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session, {{based on the idea}} that [...] "there <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the world who needed treatment but couldn't afford therapy." [...] Johns composed most of the song's lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London's Shepherds Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said [...] "Luv Your Life" [...] was dedicated [...] "to all my ladies".|$|E

Her portraiture was unusual within exhibitions of modernist photography held in 1928–1929 in Brussels and Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Stein, {{writing in}} The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), criticized Ruse's book. Stein found Ruse's {{definition}} of a [...] "homosexual" [...] to be vague and open to possible objections, noting that Ruse does not explain whether he considers someone who only rarely wants {{to have sex with}} a person of the same sex [...] "homosexual", or whether wanting to have sex with a person of the opposite sex would disqualify a person from being [...] "homosexual". Though Stein granted that Ruse's definition is wide enough to be a candidate for playing a role in explanation in the sciences or the social sciences, he maintained that its wideness does not prove that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups ("natural kinds"). Stein found Ruse's critique of social constructionism unconvincing. He rejected Ruse's suggestion that defining sexual orientation in terms of sexual feelings rather than sexual behavior shows that social constructionism is false. Stein observed that while Ruse refers to the work of John Boswell to support his case that there <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> periods from that Ancient Greece to that of the Renaissance who were recognized as having a homosexual orientation, such evidence can be interpreted differently. Stein rejected Ruse's defense of sexual orientation research, arguing that the ethical implications of a research program must be considered in deciding whether the program is worth pursuing.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was indeed}} terribly {{surprised}} at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the place, and would then never rest till they had found me out.

It was not necessary to look any further for the escaped negro. Of course, he had been picked up by these people.|$|E
60|$|When I {{first saw}} England, {{she was in}} {{mourning}} for the young Princess Charlotte, {{the hope of the}} empire.
