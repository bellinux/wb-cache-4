50|$|With the air flowing inwards, wingtip {{vortices}} and {{the accompanying}} drag are reduced. Instead, the fuselage acts as a very large <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> and, since wings are generally larger at the root, this raises the maximum lift coefficient allowing a smaller wing.|$|E
50|$|A {{dogtooth}} is a small, sharp zig-zag {{break in}} {{the leading edge of}} a wing. It is usually used on a swept wing, to generate a vortex flow field to prevent separated flow from progressing outboard at high angle of attack. The effect is the same as a <b>wing</b> <b>fence.</b> It can also be used on straight wings in a Drooped Leading Edge arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Wolfgang Liebe, who is {{generally}} credited with inventing <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> filed a patent {{for it in}} 1938 while working on the Messerschmitt BF 109B. After World War II, Soviet military aircraft designers became known for their habit of using <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> using them on aircraft as varied as Mikoyan MiG-15s and Tupolev Tu-22Ms.|$|R

50|$|Sweeping a wing forward has {{approximately}} the same effect as rearward in terms of drag reduction, but has other advantages in terms of low-speed handling where tip stall problems simply go away. In this case the low-speed air flows towards the fuselage, which acts as a very large <b>wing</b> <b>fence.</b> Additionally, wings are generally larger at the root anyway, which allows them to have better low-speed lift.|$|E
50|$|More common {{solutions}} to the problem of spanwise flow is the use of a <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> or the related dogtooth notch on {{the leading edge of the}} wing. This disrupts the flow and re-directs it rearward, while also causing the buildup of stagnant air inboard to lower the stall point. This does have an effect on overall airflow on the wing, and is generally not used where the sweep is mild.|$|E
5000|$|Other easily visible {{differences}} to its predecessor were {{the addition of}} a third <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> on each wing, {{the addition of a}} ventral fin and a longer and less tapered rear fuselage that added about one meter in length. The MiG-17 shared the same Klimov VK-1 engine, and {{much of the rest of}} its construction such as the forward fuselage, landing gear and gun installation was carried over. The first prototype, designated I-330 [...] "SI" [...] by the construction bureau, was flown on the 14 January 1950, piloted by Ivan Ivashchenko.|$|E
25|$|Vortilons {{are often}} used to improve {{low-speed}} aileron performance, thereby increasing resistance to spin. They {{can be used as}} an alternative to <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> which also restrict airflow along the span of the wing. Vortilons only stream vortices at high angles of attack and produce less drag at higher speeds than <b>wing</b> <b>fences.</b> Pylons used to mount jet engines under the wing produce a similar effect.|$|R
50|$|A 40 acre area {{including}} the <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> and corral was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|The I-7U quarter-chord {{wing sweep}} was reduced from 60 degrees to 57 degrees, {{retaining}} the <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> {{but at the}} new sweep angle.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem took on many forms. One was the addition of a fin known as a <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> on the upper surface of the wing to redirect the flow to the rear (see the MiG-15 as an example.) Another closely related design was addition of a dogtooth notch to the leading edge (Avro Arrow). Other designs took a more radical approach, including the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor's wing that grew wider towards the tip to provide more lift at the tip. The Handley Page Victor had a crescent wing with substantial sweep-back near the wing root where the wing was thickest, and progressively reducing sweep along the span as the wing thickness reduced towards the tip.|$|E
5000|$|Although many {{components}} of the Su-15 were similar or identical to the previous Su-9 and Su-11 (NATO reporting name [...] "Fishpot"), including Sukhoi's characteristic rear-fuselage Air brake, the Su-15 abandoned the shock-inlet cone nose intake for side-mounted intake ramps with splitter plates feeding two powerful turbojet engines, initially the Tumansky R-11F2S-300. The change allowed room in the nose for a powerful search radar, initially the RP-22 Oryol-D (NATO 'Skip Spin'). The early Su-15 ("Flagon-A") had pure delta wings like its predecessors, but these were replaced from the 11th production series onward by a new double-delta wing of increased span and area, with a small <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> above each outer pylon and blown flaps to improve landing characteristics. This {{was accompanied by a}} new tail of greater anhedral and a vertical fin of reduced height.|$|E
50|$|On 30 July 1953, {{the first}} Sabre Mk.5 flew with the Orenda 10 engine, which {{gave it a}} clear rate of climb and ceiling {{advantage}} over earlier variants. Other Mk 5 improvements included a new oxygen system and improved maneuverability and low-speed characteristics achieved by increasing the wing chord by six in (15.2 cm) at the root and three in. (7.2 cm) at the wing tip along with fitting a small vertical <b>wing</b> <b>fence.</b> This modification, originated by North American on the F-86F, dramatically improved maneuverability, though {{the loss of the}} slatted leading edge increased landing speed and degraded low speed handling considerably. Canadair built 370 Mk 5s with the majority designated for use in the RCAF’s Air Division squadrons in Europe to replace the Mk.2s. A total of 75 RCAF Sabre 5s were transferred to the German Luftwaffe during 1957.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to determine the effect of <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> fuselage contouring, varying wing sweepback angle from 40 deg. to 45 deg., mounting the horizontal tail on an outboard boom) and wing thickness distribution upon the buffeting response of typical airplane configurations employing sweptback wings of high aspect ratio. The tests were conducted through an angle-of-attack range at Mach numbers varying from 0. 60 to 0. 92 at a Reynolds number of 2 million. For the combinations with 40 deg. of sweepback, the addition of multiple <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> usually decreased the buffeting at moderate and high lift coefficients and reduced the erratic variation of buffet intensities with increasing lift coefficient and Mach number. Fuselage contouring also reduced buffeting but was not as effective as the <b>wing</b> <b>fences.</b> At most Mach numbers, buffeting occurred at higher lift coefficients for the combination with the NACA 64 A thickness distributions than for the combination with the NACA four-digit thickness distributions. At high subsonic speeds, heavy buffeting was usually indicated at lift coefficients which were lower than the lift coefficients for static-longitudinal instability. The addition of <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> improved the pitching-moment characteristics but had little effect on the onset of buffeting. For most test conditions and model configurations, the root-mean- square and the maximum values measured for relative buffeting indicated similar effects and trends; however, the maximum buffeting loads were usually two to three times the root-mean-square intensities...|$|R
50|$|Nonweiler's {{original}} design used the shock wave {{generated by the}} aircraft {{as a way to}} control spanwise flow, and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing {{in the same way as}} a <b>wing</b> <b>fence.</b> While working on these concepts, he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft. In this case, the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally, spanwise, but vertically as well. The only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended. Since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage, a large volume of air would be trapped, much more than the more basic approach he first developed. Furthermore, since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft, shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings, lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage.|$|E
40|$|AFIT/GAE/ENY/ 07 -J 19 A {{computational}} {{study of}} the effects of a <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> on the T- 38 Talon was performed. RANS simulations were conducted using the CFD solver AVUS to examine the flow around the T- 38 and the fence at a Reynolds number of 10 x 106. The T- 38 was modeled as a half aircraft with a symmetry plane down the center line and did not include the empennage. The engine inlet and exhaust were modeled as sink and source boundary conditions using mass flow and pressure specifications. Two fence geometries placed 26 ” from the wing tip were tested. The first fence, called a simple fence, ran chordwise on the upper surface of the wing. It did not produce significant benefits. The second fence geometry, called the extended fence, wrapped around {{the leading edge of the}} wing and produced a 4. 9 % increase in CL at 15 ◦ angle of attack. It was found that the vortices generated by the fence energized the flow outboard the fence, increasing lift. The extended fence generated vortices significantly stronger than the simple fence, resulting in a higher CL at 15 ◦ angle of attack. These findings indicate that the T- 38 high angle of attack performance would be improved by the addition of an extended <b>wing</b> <b>fence.</b> i...|$|E
40|$|A {{low-speed}} {{investigation was}} made of a 1 / 6 -scale model of the Republic XF- 84 H airplane. The model had a single tractor propeller and a 40 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 3. 45. This investigation was undertaken to provide information {{on the effects of}} propeller operation on longitudinal stability characteristics for the XF - 84 H airplane and to provide an indication of slipstream effects that might be encountered on similar swept-wing configurations. Effects of propeller operation were generally destabilizing for all conditions investigated; however, the over-all stability characteristics with power on were greatly dependent on the power-off characteristics. With flaps and slats retracted, longitudinal instability was present at moderate angles of attack both with the propeller off and with power on. The longitudinal stability with flaps and slats deflected, which was satisfactory without power, was decreased by propeller operation, but no marked pitch-up tendency was indicated. Significant improvement in the power-on stability with flaps retracted was achieved by use of either a <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> at 75 percent semispan, a leading-edge chord-extension from 65 to 94 percent semispan, or a raised horizontal tail located 65 percent semispan above the thrust line...|$|E
50|$|The swept wings were {{of medium}} taper with 2/3 span flaps / 1/3 span ailerons, and <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> at {{approximately}} 1/2 span. The tail unit comprised a sharply swept fin with a delta tailplane at 2/3 fin length.|$|R
50|$|The missile itself, {{like the}} earlier KS-1, is {{extremely}} large, nearly nine meters in length with a wingspan of approximately {{four and a}} half meters and weighing 4,000 kilograms. It has swept wings with two <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> on each <b>wing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Washout may be {{accomplished}} by other means e.g. modified aerofoil section, vortex generators, leading edge <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> notches, or stall strips. This {{is referred to as}} aerodynamic washout. Its purpose is to tailor the spanwise lift distribution or reduce the probability of wing tip stall.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley 19 -foot pressure tunnel on a 0. 3 -scale model of the Republic RF- 84 F airplane to determine modifications which would eliminate the pitch-up that occurred near maximum lift during flight tests of the airplane. The effects of high-lift and stall-control devices, horizontal tail locations, external stores, and various inlets on the longitudinal characteristics of the model were investigated. For the most part, these tests were conducted at a Reynolds number of 9. 0 x 10 (exp 6) and a Mach number of 0. 19. The results indicated that {{from the standpoint of}} stability the inlets should possess blunted side bodies. The horizontal tail located at either the highest or lowest position investigated improved the stability of the model. Three configurations were found for the model equipped with the production tail which eliminated the pitch-up through the lift range up to the maximum lift and provided a stable static margin which did not vary more than 15 % of the mean aerodynamic chord through the lift range up to 85 % of maximum lift. The three configurations are as follows: the production wing-fuselage-tail combination with an inlet similar to the production inlet but smaller in plan form in conjunction with either (1) a <b>wing</b> <b>fence</b> located at 65 % of the win semispan or (2) an 11. 7 % chord leading-edge extension extending from 65. 8 to 95. 8 % of the wing semispan and (3) the production wing-fuselage-tail combination with the production inlet and an 11. 7 % chord leading-edge extension extending from 70. 8 to 95. 8 % of the wing semispan...|$|E
50|$|The wing had two spars {{with two}} <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> ranging the entire chord, with {{hydraulically}} operated ailerons and Fowler flaps.

40|$|Low-speed {{tests of}} a model with a wing swept back 35 degrees at the 0. 33 -chord line and a {{horizontal}} tail located well above the extended wing-chord plane indicated static longitudinal instability at moderate angles of attack for all configurations tested. An investigation therefore was made {{to determine whether the}} longitudinal stability could be improved by the use of chordwise <b>wing</b> <b>fences,</b> by lowering the horizontal tail, or by a combination of both. The results of the investigation showed that the longitudinal stability characteristics of the model with slats retracted could be improved at moderate angles of attack by placing chordwise <b>wing</b> <b>fences</b> at a spanwise station of about 73 percent of the wing semispan from the plane of symmetry provided the nose of the fence extended slightly beyond or around the wing leading edge...|$|R
