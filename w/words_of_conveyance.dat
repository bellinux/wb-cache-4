5000|$|Traditionally, a fee tail {{was created}} by a trust {{established}} in a deed, often a marriage settlement, or in a will [...] "to A and the heirs of his body". The crucial difference between the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>conveyance</b> and the words that created a fee simple ("to A and his heirs") is that the heirs [...] "in tail" [...] must be the children begotten by the landowner. It was also possible to have [...] "fee tail male", which only sons could inherit, and [...] "fee tail female", which only daughters could inherit; and [...] "fee tail special", which had a further condition of inheritance, usually restricting succession to certain [...] "heirs of the body" [...] and excluding others. Land subject to these conditions {{was said to be}} [...] "entailed" [...] or [...] "held in-tail", with the restrictions themselves known as entailments.|$|E
5000|$|The rule makes a {{difference}} when property owners make inter vivos gifts of less than fee simple interests. Suppose Adam owns title to lands, is married to Beulah, and executes a deed [...] "to Beulah for life, and then to Adam's heirs", Caleb and Dinah. Adam's intent in these <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>conveyance</b> {{would appear to be}} to grant Beulah a life estate, and then create a vested remainder interest in his apparent heirs Caleb and Dinah. The remainder interest is vested because Beulah is mortal; her death is certain to happen. But, since Caleb and Dinah are already Adam's apparent heirs, their interest under the laws of descent is [...] "worthier" [...] than the interest they take under the instrument, and the deed is construed as if Adam had stopped with [...] "to Beulah for life." [...] This doctrine is further {{complicated by the fact that}} although Caleb and Dinah are Adam's heirs apparent, it is legally impossible to determine who is an heir until the death of the grantor.|$|E
5000|$|The law deemed {{that since}} no one is an [...] "heir" [...] until the person he or she {{inherits}} from dies, an {{attempt to create a}} remainder interest in the heir created no present interest at all. This interpretation draws strength by analogy from the common <b>words</b> <b>of</b> a <b>conveyance</b> in fee simple, [...] "to N. and his heirs." [...] This conveyance creates no present interest in any heir; why should a remainder do the same? ...|$|R
