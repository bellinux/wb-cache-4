5|$|On September 9, 2014, a Texas judge sentenced Leaf to five years' imprisonment, giving {{credit for}} {{time spent in}} prison in Montana. According to ESPN, Leaf <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> further time in jail, but would also not be {{released}} from Montana prison. On December 3, 2014, Leaf {{was released from prison}} and placed under the supervision of Great Falls Probation and Parole.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{was soon}} rotated home on 5 March. Over 50 Officers {{gathered}} for a formal farewell dinner and they presented him with a silver model of his S.E.5A on 4 March. McCudden <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action again. In the remaining eight months of the war, only British pilots Billy Bishop (72) and Mick Mannock (61) and Raymond Collishaw (60) would surpass his total while serving with the RFC (and later the Royal Air Force—RAF). Ernst Udet (62) René Fonck (75) and Manfred von Richthofen (80) were the only foreign pilots to beat McCudden's total.|$|E
5|$|Paoli {{spent the}} last 20 {{years of his life}} {{teaching}} voice and singing in San Juan, while also working {{for the establishment of a}} music conservatory in that city. He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> this last dream come true, because he developed cancer and died at age 75. He was buried in San Juan, but his remains were later transferred to a mausoleum in his birth town of Ponce.|$|E

60|$|Well, they <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>see</b> {{him this}} night. Both {{whistles}} arose in duet. He writhed {{in his chair}} and groaned. No, they <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>see</b> him this night, he reiterated, at the same time rising to his feet. It was certainly impossible for him to join them when he had not yet learned about the Draconian reforms. The same force which had held him to the window now seemed drawing him across the room to the desk. It made him put the history on top of his school-books, and he had the door unlocked and was half-way into the hall before he realized it. He started to return, but the thought came to him that he could go out for a little while and then come back and do his work.|$|R

5|$|The 104th Infantry Division {{was first}} {{constituted}} on 24 June 1921 as the 104th Division, before being organized and activated in October {{of that year}} in Salt Lake City, Utah. Assigned to the division were the 207th and 208th Infantry Brigades, containing the 413th, 414th, 415th, and 416th Infantry Regiments. As {{a unit of the}} Organized Reserves, the division represented assets from the states of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada. In 1924 it received its shoulder sleeve insignia. The division <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> significant duty until World War II.|$|E
5|$|Still {{interested}} in military affairs, Buckner joined the Illinois State Militia of Cook County as a major. On April 3, 1857, {{he was appointed}} adjutant general of Illinois by Governor William Henry Bissell. He resigned the post in October of the same year. Following the Mountain Meadows massacre, a regiment of Illinois volunteers organized for potential service in a campaign against the Mormons. Buckner was offered command of the unit and a promotion {{to the rank of}} colonel. He accepted the position, but predicted that the unit <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> action. His prediction proved correct, as negotiations between the federal government and Mormon leaders eased tensions between the two.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values {{to the extent}} that they would never rob, or kill any living being. Even they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E

5|$|Evans' {{contributions}} to steam {{were not as}} ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he {{played a critical role}} by inventing and propagating the high-pressure steam engine in the United States. Evans' engines, particularly the Columbian, were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas, and his death during steam's infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for high-pressure engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans' dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high-pressure engine that would make that dream possible.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the audience <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating they would get soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
