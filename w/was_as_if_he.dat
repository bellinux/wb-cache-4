Italy {{was important in}} providing Berlioz with experiences that would be impossible in France. At times, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> himself was actually experiencing the Romantic tales of Byron in person; consorting with brigands, corsairs, and peasants. He returned to Paris in November 1832.|$|E

Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died seven weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had rehearsed the role all his life, and the performance garnered other major accolades as well, some even calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.|$|E
25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E

500|$|York Bowen {{thought it}} regrettable that Bax's orchestral works {{frequently}} call for exceptionally large forces: [...] "When the score demands such luxuries as triple or quadruple woodwind, six horns, {{three or four}} trumpets, extra percussion and perhaps organ, it is undoubtedly throwing extra difficulties {{in the way of}} performance." [...] The composer Eric Coates commented that Bax's music appealed greatly to orchestral players: [...] "whichever instrument he wrote for, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> played that instrument himself, so well did he seem to write for it".|$|E

Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it [...] "the perfect Hamlet". The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.|$|E
500|$|The Prince Regent was prostrated with grief, and {{was unable}} to attend his child's funeral. [...] Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock. [...] On recovering, she stated, [...] "England, that great country, has lost {{everything}} in losing my ever beloved daughter." [...] Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning. [...] The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold. [...] Stockmar wrote years later, [...] "November saw the ruin of this happy home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold. [...] He has never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life." [...] According to Holme, [...] "without Charlotte he was incomplete.

50|$|The Quran relates a {{slightly}} different version; as in the Bible, both offered sacrifice and Cain's was rejected; Cain threatens Abel, who points out that killing him would put Cain among the companions of the fire; Cain murders Abel, but regrets it.

500|$|According to Huntford, {{the news}} of Scott's death meant that [...] "Amundsen the victor was eclipsed... by Scott the martyr". In the United Kingdom a myth quickly {{developed}} in which Scott was portrayed as one who had behaved nobly and played the game fairly. He had been defeated because, by contrast, Amundsen was a mere glory-seeker who had concealed his true intentions, had used dogs {{rather than relying on}} honest man-hauling and had slaughtered these same dogs for food. Furthermore, he was considered a [...] "professional" [...] which, in the mindset of upper-class Britain of that time, diminished anything he might have accomplished. This narrative was heavily reinforced with the publication of Scott's journals and his [...] "Message to the Public". [...] Huntford points out that [...] " [...] literary talent was his trump. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had reached out from his buried tent and taken revenge." [...] Even so, among explorers Amundsen's name continued to be respected. [...] In his account of the Terra Nova expedition written a few years later, Scott's comrade Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote that the primary reason for Amundsen's success was [...] "the very remarkable qualities of the man", specifically his courage in choosing to discover a new route rather than follow the known path.|$|E
500|$|Nurmi {{enjoyed the}} Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, {{crediting}} the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924. He had a versatile diet, {{although he had}} practiced vegetarianism {{between the ages of}} 15 and 21. Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be [...] "taciturn", [...] "stony-faced" [...] and [...] "stubborn". He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his [...] "sarcastic sense of humour" [...] among the small circles he knew. Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak, Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media, stating later on his 75th birthday, [...] "orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry." [...] French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi's intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi [...] "is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings." [...] Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him Suuri vaikenija (The Great Silent One), and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi's persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: [...] "Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was all the time playing a role in a drama." ...|$|E

Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135kg). Coupled with the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50kg).

The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of Hoboken, New Jersey, in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230,000,000 worth of bonds.

He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1–1 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he was shocked to see his older brother Tony in the crowd {{supporting}} Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch. Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea.
