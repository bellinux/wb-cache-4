The emission cycle was performed both for cold and hot engine start up conditions. Modal analysis of emission compounds {{was carried out}} with the focus on nitro-gen oxides (NOx) emission. The scope of the work {{was to assess the}} influence of cold start effect on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system operation efficiency. Due {{to the fact that the}} urea injection strategy in SCR system can by activated only after certain exhaust gas temperature threshold is achieved, the NOx emission on <b>WHTC</b> cold start <b>cycle</b> is significantly greater than for the hot start one. Result analysis included also determination of time period needed for achieving the readiness of SCR system to work efficiently. The occurrence of ammonia slip emissions downstream SCR was also monitored...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} initial {{conditions}} of tropical cyclone (TC) forecast models, a dynamical initialization (DI) scheme using <b>cycle</b> <b>runs</b> is developed and implemented into a real-time forecast system for northwest Pacific TCs {{based on the}} Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. In this scheme, <b>cycle</b> <b>runs</b> with a 6 -h window before the initial forecast time are repeatedly conducted to spin up the axisymmetric component of the TC vortex until the model TC intensity {{is comparable to the}} observed. This is followed by a 72 -h forecast using the Global Forecast System (GFS) prediction as lateral boundary conditions. In the DI scheme, the spectral nudging technique is employed during each <b>cycle</b> <b>run</b> to reduce bias in the large-scale environmental field, and the relocation method is applied after the last <b>cycle</b> <b>run</b> to reduce the initial position error. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DI scheme, 69 forecast experiments with and without the DI are conducted for 13 TCs over the northwest Pacific in 2010 and 2011. The DI shows positive effects on both track and intensity forecasts of TCs, although its overall skill depends strongly on the performance of the GFS forecasts. Compared to the forecasts without the DI, on average, forecasts with the DI reduce the position and intensity errors by 10 % and 30 %, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed DI scheme improves the initial TC vortex structure and intensity and provides warm physics spinup, producing initial states consistent with the forecast model, thus achieving improved track and intensity forecasts. close 4...|$|R

The climate model currently exists in two parallel versions: one running on the Amdahl and the other running on the CYBER 203. These two versions are as nearly identical as machine capability and the requirement for high speed performance will allow. Developmental changes are made on the Amdahl/CMS version for ease of testing and rapidity of turnaround. The changes are subsequently incorporated into the CYBER 203 version using vectorization techniques where speed improvement can be realized.
