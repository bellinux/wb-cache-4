ANIMPOL was founded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7) of the European Commission and the project has started on the 1 st January 2010. The main objective is the development of an industrial process, that brings together the solution of industrial waste problems with essential alternative strategies for polymer industry. Waste streams from slaughterhouses are converted towards fatty acid esters (FAMEs, biodiesel). Subsequently the FAME fractions, that negatively influence the biodiesel properties as a fuel, are biotechnologically converted towards high-value polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers. This brings together representatives of the waste producers from animal processing industry and bio-fuel industry with the polymer industry looking for alternatives technologies. Research will be done in close cooperation between academic and industrial partners and will last for 36 months. In addition to the meat processing plant Reistenhofer GesmbH and the Scottish biodiesel producer Argent Energy (UK) Limited, other industrial partners are the italian packaging manufacturer Termoplast and the german company Argus Environmental Biotechnology GmbH (responsible for the downstream processing). From the academic side TU Graz acts as project coordinator and expert on biotechnology (Prof. Braunegg). Prof. Narodoslawsky’s group from TU Graz is responsable for Life Cycle Assessment and Prof. Schnitzer’s group from the same university for the development of cleaner production processes. The group of Prof. Casella (University of Padova, Italy) will be on charge of the microbiology and genetics part and Prof. Horvat (University of Zagreb, Croazia) for the mathematical modeling of bioprocesses. The Karl-Franzens University Graz (Prof. Mittelbach) takes over the task of the optimized production of biodiesel from animal fats, while the University of Pisa (Prof. Chiellini), National the Institute of Chemistry (Ljubljana, Dr. Krzan) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (Prof. Kowalczuk) have specific tasks in the field of polymer characterization. Providing long-term strategies for long-term problems, the project will result in value creation for all players. The development of this integrated process will give results in microbiology, genetics, biotechnology, chemical engineering, polymer chemistry- and processing and life cycle analysis, combined with feasibility studies for marketing of the final products. The project activities aim at solving local waste problems affecting the entire EU; the solutions will be developed on local scales, but are meant to be applied to the entire EU and will provide cost-efficient and alternatives for polymer industry.

Solid waste disposal problems, mostly in highly urbanized environments, energy shortages (primarily oil) and/or high petroleum prices, as well as environmental {{issues such as the}} shrinking landfill capacity, can all be addressed by converting waste material into useful and saleable products. This paper brings to the attention a possible strategy {{in order to meet the}} general EU directives concerning the residues utilization and percentage contribution for the total energy consumption by 2020, by evaluating the use of animal by-products (category 3, as defined in the directive 2002 / 1774 /EC) for energy purposes. Slaughterhouse waste represents an important potential source of renewable energy: on average, 40 – 50 % of a live animal is waste, with a potential energy content close to diesel fuel. Treatment of animal <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> and the subsequent conversion to electricity is investigated as a case study in the Campania Region (Italy) : the animal waste undergoes a rendering process, to separate a protein-rich fraction useful for animal meal production and a fat-rich fraction, to be combusted in a diesel engine for power and heat generation (CHP). An environmental assessment of the entire process is performed by means of LCA, providing a quantitative understanding of the plant processing. The study aims to understand to what extent electricity production from animal fat is environmentally sound and if there are steps and/or components that require further attention. The environmental impacts of the electricity production <b>from</b> animal <b>waste</b> are investigated adopting different points of view and they are also compared to the impacts of Italian electricity production (mix of fossil fuels and renewables).

40|$|The great {{demand for}} animal protein was {{responsible}} for the increase on the broilers production and hence, the generation of <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> the poultry slaughter was increased as well, which in turn, propelled the development of techniques that allow the reuse and recycling of these wastes. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of composting on the treatment and recycling of solid <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> poultry <b>slaughterhouse.</b> The solid <b>waste</b> was <b>from</b> a commercial poultry slaughterhouse and was composed of viscera, muscle, fat, bone, blood and feathers that was mixed with a source of carbon, rice husk. Initially, a windrow with a volume of 1. 5 m(3) was built, and then some parameters were monitored: temperature, total solids (TS), volatile (VS), N, P, K, organic carbon (C), composting organic matter (COC), organic matter resistant to composting (MORC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), mass and volume of the windrow, most probable number (MPN) of total and fecal coliforms, as well as their reductions during the process. The maximum temperature reached in the center of the windrow was 53. 3 degrees C (weekly average) since reductions of weight of TS and VS and volume during the pre-composting were 36. 1, 44. 3 and 23. 3 %, respectively and during the composting process was 21. 8, 23. 8 and 4. 4 %. The low volume reduction can be associated with high concentrations of MORC (40. 1 %) which can be mainly related to the quality of the carbon source. The process produced satisfactory total reductions of TS, VS and volume that were respectively, 50. 1, 57. 5 and 26. 7 %. However reductions were observed in 43 % of amount of nitrogen in the final compound. Despite reductions in nitrogen content, composting proved to be an effective method in the treatment of solid <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> poultry <b>slaughterhouse.</b> Em virtude da grande demanda por proteína de origem animal, tem-se aumentado a produção de frangos de corte e consequentemente a geração de resíduos provenientes do abate de aves, sendo necessário o desenvolvimento de técnicas que permitam o aproveitamento e reciclagem desses materiais.

Utilizou-se resíduo sólido de abatedouro avícola comercial composto por fragmentos de vísceras, tecido muscular, adiposo e ósseo, sangue coagulado e penas e, como fonte de carbono, a casca de arroz. Montou-se uma leira com 1, 5 m 3 de volume inicial, na qual foram monitorados os parâmetros: temperatura, teores de sólidos totais (ST), voláteis (SV), N, P, K, carbono orgânico (C), matéria orgânica compostável (MOC), matéria orgânica resistente à compostagem (MORC), demanda química de oxigênio (DQO), massa e volume enleirados, número mais provável (NMP) de coliformes totais e termotolerantes, bem como suas reduções durante o processo. A temperatura máxima atingida no centro da leira foi de 53, 3 ºC (média semanal), já as reduções de massa de ST e SV e volume durante o processo de pré-compostagem foram de 36, 1; 44, 3 e 23, 3 %, respectivamente, e, durante o processo de compostagem, foram de 21, 8; 23, 8 e 4, 4 %. A baixa redução do volume das leiras pode estar associada à alta concentração de MORC (40, 1 %) que pode ser principalmente relacionada à qualidade da fonte de carbono.

De-contamination may be conducted by extended storage, until field conditions are suitable for application to land as source of agricultural nutrients. Results: The hygienic evaluation of manure and slurry coming from a plant that collects cattle livestock <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> a big <b>slaughterhouse</b> was carried out. Samples were even collected from spillages {{in the area around}} the plant. Microbial analyses highlighted the massive presence of faecal indicators in all samples: mean counts of Escherichia coli and enterococci were always above EU limits for marketable processed manure products. Cultures referable to the genus Brucella spp. were recorded in two samples of fresh manure but not in the aged ones. Conventional isolation techniques failed to detect members of the Mycobacterium genus, while by means of IS 900 and F 57 PCR real-time system on DNA directly extracted from environmental samples, the pathogen was detected in all cases. Conclusions: Thoughtful design of manure storage infrastructure is critical to prevent spills and over-topping of an open structure. The documented overload situation seems to lay the basis for an ongoing environmental contamination by enteric organisms and opportunistic pathogens circuit faecal-oral route. Moreover, the type of wastes analysed during this study, namely a mixture of fresh cattle manure, bedding and rumen content, needs a longer storage period or, alternatively, of specific chemical, biological or thermal treatments for stabilization...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of new technologies for renewable energy production is crucial for decreasing the reliance in fossil fuels and improving global sustainability. Waste materials are valuable resources {{that can be used}} for the production of energy carriers. Organic wastes can be anaerobically digested to ultimately produce methane. Hydrogen can be recovered from this process, if methanogenesis is inhibited. These energy carriers can also be derived from recalcitrant materials in a two step-process combining waste gasification and subsequent syngas bioconversion. Research carried out at our group focuses on the study of anaerobic processes for the production of energy-carriers using a multidisciplinary approach that combines both microbiological and technological aspects. Important achievements have been made within the anaerobic digestion of lipid-rich <b>wastes.</b> <b>From</b> our research, it became clear that lipids and LCFA-rich wastewater anaerobic treatment can be feasible with efficient methane recovery. Additionally, wastes containing fats and proteins, such as <b>wastes</b> <b>from</b> poultry industry, <b>slaughterhouse</b> and meat-processing industry have been assessed for methane production. Hydrolysis of cellulolytic and proteinaceous materials in solid wastes was enhanced using physicochemical pre-treatments and bioaugmentation, which is auspicious for optimal methane production. Sugar-rich wastes were used for assessing biohydrogen production and allowed the identification of critical aspects for methanogenesis inhibition. Immobilization of hydrogen-producing microorganisms in high rate continuous reactors was performed with good hydrogen recovery. Currently, we are studying the utilization of latex bionanocoatings for the entrapment of hydrogen-producing microorganisms as a means to improve cell immobilization.
