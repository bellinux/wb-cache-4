5|$|The {{ownership}} of the line was gradually {{taken over by the}} municipality through Oslo Sporveier. In 1975, most of the shares were bought, along <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> Oslo Sporveier had received as part of the municipal merger with Aker in 1948. Gradually during the 1970s and 1980s, Holmenkolbanen became more integrated into Oslo Sporveier, including the two using the same rolling stock, tickets and uniforms. Oslo Sporveier upgraded the line in {{the last half of the}} 1970s, laying new ties, upgrading the tracks to higher weight and purchasing new trams.|$|E
5|$|By 13 January, {{all of the}} French fleet {{had been}} {{accounted}} for except the small brig Mutine, which was blown {{all the way to}} Santa Cruz and was captured there in July, and the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme. Droits de l'Homme had been among the ships under Bouvet in Bantry Bay and then <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> carried on to the Shannon, but as the fleet broke up she became separated. With provisions running low and landings still impossible, Captain Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse determined to return to France independently. Progress was slow as Droits de l'Homme was overloaded with 1,300 men, including 800 soldiers under General Jean Humbert. She was further delayed when she encountered and captured a small British privateer named Cumberland. As a result, La Crosse had only reached Ushant by 13 January, where he encountered the same fog that had enabled Révolution and Fraternité to reach safety.|$|E
5|$|It then {{occurred}} to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it {{occurred to}} me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} socio {{cultural}} theory would be social settings where people {{work together to}} solve collective problems, such as athletic teams, study groups, work groups, and civic organization. Although individuals will have internalized goals, they will also develop internalized goals of others, {{as well as new}} interests and goals collectively <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> they feel socially connected to.|$|E
25|$|Genital warts, {{which are}} a form of benign tumor of {{epithelial}} cells, are also caused by various strains of HPV. However, these serotypes are usually not related to cervical cancer.

25|$|A popular way of {{classifying}} magmatic volcanoes is {{by their}} frequency of eruption, <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> erupt regularly called active, {{those that have}} erupted in historical times but are now quiet called dormant or inactive, and those that have not erupted in historical times called extinct. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.|$|E
25|$|Chiapas {{is located}} in the {{tropical}} belt of the planet, but the climate is moderated in many areas by altitude. For this reason, there are hot, semi-hot, temperate and even cold climates. There are areas with abundant rainfall year-round along <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> receive most of their rain from May to October with a dry season from November to April. The mountain areas affect wind and moisture flow over the state, concentrating moisture in certain areas of the state. They also are responsible for some cloud-covered rainforest areas in the Sierra Madre.|$|E

The Black Book has been published by the China Academy of Social Studies Press as American History and the Story of the Black Book.|$|E
25|$|Since Android {{devices are}} usually battery-powered, Android is {{designed}} to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> have been inactive for longest. Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killers were doing more harm than good.|$|E
25|$|In {{planning}} {{for the construction of}} the tunnel, the possibility of using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) was considered in 1966. Discussions were held in Australia <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> had experience with them, or had previously investigated using them, and as a result, it was felt that further investigations into the idea were justified. Rock samples were submitted to the manufacturers (Jarva Company) for an assessment of the suitability of the machines for the tunnel project. It was felt that such a machine would be able to handle the eastern end of the tunnel, but that the western end could pose problems if the rock was found to be too fractured.|$|E

25|$|By 1904, Lorentz had {{expanded}} his theory such {{that he had}} arrived at equations formally identical <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> Einstein were to derive later (i.e. the Lorentz transform), but with a fundamentally different interpretation. As a theory of dynamics (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter. Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called local time, with which he could explain the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena. However, Lorentz considered local time to be only an auxiliary mathematical tool, a trick as it were, to simplify the transformation from one system into another.|$|E
25|$|The Day of the Dead {{season is}} the busiest for the Linares Family, with {{interest}} in the holiday in the United States and Europe translating to even more business for the enterprise. Their animated skeletons {{are known for their}} variety <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> dance, ride skateboards and do any number of common occupations past and present such as streetcar driver. They produce multicolored cardboard and paper skulls in various sizes although the most common is about 75cm tall. These skulls have various themes such as Don Quixote, street vendors of various types, bullfighters and figures from popular culture. They also make a version to imitate the sugar skulls created for Day of the Dead, which are profusely decorated with flowers, birds and other items. Their work has stood out for its ability to reinvent classic themes of Mexican cartonería.|$|E

Hyde gives Emma the answer and he tells her to follow a red bird. Later that night, Emma takes the advice after she sees one during the search for survivors, and it leads Emma to The Oracle, a young girl who gives Emma a vision of her future as The Savior, which reveals a confrontation with an unknown attacker who plans to kill Emma as she was defending her family; The Oracle also hints of many paths Emma could take but the outcome might or might not change. When Emma returns to confront Hyde about this, he explain that the person she'll face in the future will be her ending but given his previous encounters <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> came before her, he tells Emma that the enemy is among the residents, so Emma decides for her family's sake to keep this to herself.|$|E
