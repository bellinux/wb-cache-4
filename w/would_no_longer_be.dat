5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although he <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won {{the second and third}} stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.|$|E

Over 60 witnesses had been called. A source reported to be close to Baledrokadroka quoted him as threatening to open [...] "a can of worms" [...] on the Military if forced to testify. Meanwhile, lawyer Devanesh Sharma questioned the validity of the Board of Inquiry, saying that its being chaired by Lieutenant Colonel Samuela Saumatua, a subordinate of Baledrokadroka's, was out of order. Leweni denied this.|$|R

50|$|If {{supersymmetry}} is {{a property}} of our universe, {{then it must}} be broken at an energy that is no lower than 1 TeV, the electroweak symmetry scale.

5|$|In September 2009, {{the company}} {{announced}} that as of March 31, 2010, PokerTracker Holdem v2 <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> supported. The decision was made because PokerTracker 3 had been released on May 15, 2008, nearly two {{years prior to the}} end-of-life date. The company felt that discontinuing support of v2 would avail resources which could be dedicated to improving PT3 and providing exceptional customer service. Similarly on December 31, 2010, PokerTracker Omaha v2 will also no longer be supported, as its features have been completely integrated into the PokerTracker 3 product line.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> able to pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E

A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> visible.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} first 50 {{games of the}} 2009–10 OHL season, Hodgson {{returned}} to the Battalion line-up on February 4, 2010, recording two assists in a 4–2 win against the Erie Otters. Following his return, he declared he <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> training in the off-season with Canucks Director of Player Development Dave Gagner, under whose supervision he suffered his back injury. Combined with the Canucks doctors' initial misdiagnosis and Vigneault's disparaging comments regarding Hodgson following the NHL pre-season, there was speculation in the media of a possible conflict between Hodgson and the Canucks organization. General Manager Mike Gillis, however, dismissed such speculation.|$|E
30|$|By {{including}} self-similar volume shapes, facade ornaments, repetitions and self-occlusion {{on a small}} scale, the Sternwarte is a {{very interesting}} example to model with the CityEngine [27]. Moreover, as the bottom row of Figure 4 shows, the facade design adapts to arbitrary variations of the underlying mass model. It would be easy to generate multiple models, if it <b>would</b> e.g., <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> known how many storeys the building originally had, for instance.|$|R
60|$|Dante {{turned to}} receive his own final delight {{from the eyes}} of Beatrice, and he found it, though the {{customary}} {{smile on her face}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> there.

5|$|For the 2007–2008 period, EVA Air {{coped with}} a 34% surge in fuel prices, which {{contributed to a}} US$61.2 million 2007 loss. In August 2008, EVA Air {{reported}} a second quarterly loss due to increased fuel costs. In response, the airline implemented cost-saving measures, including flight schedule reductions and fee increases. In early 2008, EVA Air's business office in El Segundo, California, announced a major staff reduction, with over half the staff advised that they <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> employed by May 2008. Functions performed by those local staff were shifted to Taiwan by half, such as the reservation center.|$|E
5|$|Reuben Wells was {{appointed}} as shop superintendent in 1887.

After just over 60 years, the Rogers company <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> run {{by a member of}} the Rogers family. The company reorganized under its former treasurer and new president, Robert S. Hughes, as the Rogers Locomotive Company; Jacob Rogers remained the company's principal investor. Hughes led the company until his own death in 1900. A year later, Jacob Rogers closed the Rogers Locomotive Company plant.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} incident, {{the family moved}} from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the {{financial}} problems had ended. When they reached Brussels {{they found that the}} situation was actually worse than previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After {{about a year and a}} half of work they discovered that there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his services <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> needed.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} in port, the men petitioned their captain for the pay they should have {{received}} since their employment began. If this request had been granted, the men <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have <b>been</b> tied to the ship and could easily have left, so predictably their petition was denied. After a similar petition to James Houblon by the men's wives had also failed, many of the sailors became desperate, believing that they had been sold into slavery to the Spanish.|$|R
50|$|In late 2011, Afghanistan {{opened its}} first major railway line, linking Hairatan, on the Uzbek border, with Mazar-i-Sharif.
