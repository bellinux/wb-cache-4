5|$|The Treaty of Devol {{is viewed}} as a typical example of the Byzantine {{tendency}} to settle disputes through diplomacy rather than <b>warfare,</b> <b>and</b> was both a result of and a cause for the distrust between the Byzantines and their Western European neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The three {{principal}} kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique {{engaged in}} regular <b>warfare,</b> <b>and</b> smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours.

The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine <b>warfare</b> <b>and</b> mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank <b>warfare</b> <b>and</b> sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
