50|$|The exact dates {{vary from}} year to year, {{as well as between}} states, and for public and private school. In Tasmania until and {{including}} 2012, the school year was split into three terms, the first one being the longest and including an extended Easter holiday (which was also the practice of mainland Australia until the mid-1980s). However, in 2013 Tasmania introduced a four-term year, to conform {{to the rest of the}} country. There is typically a break of two weeks mid-semester (i.e. after Term 1 and after Term 3) and a break of three weeks in the middle of the year, although this can vary between jurisdictions. In the year 2000, due to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three <b>weeks,</b> <b>compensating</b> by reducing the break in the middle of the year to two weeks.|$|R

40|$|Higher weekly benefit amounts {{and longer}} {{potential}} benefit duration {{are thought to}} encourage some unemployment insurance (UI) beneficiaries to remain unemployed longer. Much of the empirical evidence of this effect has involved {{a positive relationship between}} benefit liberality and the number of weeks that recipients collect benefits. But several analysts have argued that <b>weeks</b> of <b>compensated</b> unemployment may be a misleading measure of unemployment duration because many beneficiaries are unemployed for some time before they file for benefits. In particular, if higher benefit levels induce unemployed workers to file for benefits more promptly, then benefit level will be positively associated with compensated unemployment duration even if it has no effect on total unemployment duration...|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Countrywide was {{the subject}} of a class-action lawsuit alleging {{overtime}} violations. Countrywide was charged with working employees 10-15 hours per day, 6 to 7 days per <b>week</b> without <b>compensating</b> them for overtime wages. The lawsuit was settled in May 2005, with the payment of $30 million in compensation to 400 account executives.Additionally, Countrywide is one of many companies that conducts in-depth background searches of new employee applicants. The background search goes beyond typical employment, education, and criminal history searches, and enables a company to view the applicant's credit, and public record documents such as lawsuits and divorce records.Although it must be authorized by the applicant, Countrywide explicitly does not consider applicants who deny authorization for a search.This policy has led to otherwise qualified applicant complaints and dispute filings which claim this policy is discriminatory, invasive, and compromises the applicant's privacy.|$|R
50|$|With the {{industrial}} revolution, {{the production of}} cast iron parts brought {{about the use of}} cranes. This heavy equipment was used in the early 1900s to construct high level structures. This new technology brought about a special form of trade workers called ironworkers. They used the crane to lift steel girders into place, and used rivets to connect the girders to the columns of a structure. The mortality rate of men working in this trade was the highest of all trades, and the ironworker could be lucky to go 10 years without a serious or fatal injury. In the late 19th century, the International Union of Ironworkers would emerge from concern for safety on-the-job and the lack of protection from employers. The Union's first order of business was to give widows of ironworkers $50 to cover the costs of a funeral and to give disabled ironworkers $5 a <b>week</b> to <b>compensate</b> for lost wages. With the increase in benefits from unionization, the Union greatly increased its presence in numbers in the early 1900s. Approximately 10,000 workers were considered Ironworkers through the Union.|$|R
40|$|Bisphosphonates {{reduce the}} rate of bone {{resorption}} and bone remodelling. Given daily, they decrease the risk of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. When bisphosphonates were given at extended drug‐free intervals this antifracture efficacy was generally not seen. This {{may be due to}} the different pattern of bone remodelling changes. Data from randomised clinical studies of ibandronate, given orally or intravenously, at different doses and for variable time intervals to women with osteoporosis were examined to explore the relationship between intermittent bisphosphonate therapy, changes in bone resorption and fracture risk. The magnitude of the reduction of {{the rate of}} bone resorption at the end of the drug‐free interval rather than its fluctuation pattern after bisphosphonate administration determines antifracture efficacy, provided that these fluctuations occur within the premenopausal range. Prolongation of the drug‐free interval beyond 2  <b>weeks</b> should be <b>compensated</b> by a dose higher than the cumulative daily dose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Arachidonic (AA) and {{docosahexaenoic acid}} (DHA) brain {{accretion}} {{is essential for}} brain development. The impact of DHA-rich maternal diets on offspring brain fatty acid composition has previously been studied up to the weanling stage; however, {{there has been no}} follow-up at later stages. Here, we examine the impact of DHA-rich maternal and weaning diets on brain fatty acid composition at weaning and three weeks post-weaning. We report that DHA supplementation during lactation maintains high DHA levels in the brains of pups even when they are fed a DHA-deficient diet for three weeks after weaning. We show that boosting dietary DHA levels for three <b>weeks</b> after weaning <b>compensates</b> for a maternal DHA-deficient diet during lactation. Finally, our data indicate that brain fatty acid binding protein (FABP 7), a marker of neural stem cells, is down-regulated in the brains of six-week pups with a high DHA:AA ratio. We propose that elevated levels of DHA in developing brain accelerate brain maturation relative to DHA-deficient brains...|$|R
40|$|Out of 32 embryos flown (16 @ E 2 + 16 @ E 9) for 5 days, 16 survived. All sixteen E 2 {{were dead}} at landing. Eight were opened and eight were {{incubated}} at 1. 0 G. Autopsy showed that 4 E 2 survived over 24 hours in space. Eight E 14 hatched without anatomical malformations, and 8 E 14 were fixed. The {{height of the}} macular epithelia was 31 mu m (mean) in control and 26 mu m in flight chicks. The cross-sectional area of macular nuclei of control was 17 mu m(2) for hair cells and 14 mu m(2) in supporting cells. In flight, cross-sectional area was 17 mu m(2) in hair cells and 15 mu m(2) in supporting cells (n= 250). The shape factor of cartilage cells (1. 0 = perfect circle) between control (mean = 0. 70) and flight (mean = 0. 72), and the area of cartilaginous cells between controls (mean = 9 mu m(2)) and flight (mean = 9 mu m(2)) did not differ (n= 300). The nuclei of support cells were closer to the basement membrane in flight than in control chicks. The immunoreactivity of otoconia with anti keratan, fibronectin or chrondroitin sulfate was not different between flight and control ears. There were more afferent fibers inside the macular epithelia of flight (p< 0. 05) than control. Three of 8 flight animals had elevated vestibular thresholds (VT), with normal mean response amplitudes and latencies. Modified afferent innervation patterns requiring <b>weeks</b> to <b>compensate</b> are sufficient to elevate VT, and should be investigated further.

40|$|NORDSKOG and Crump (1948) com-pared the {{efficiency}} of estimating actual egg production from three methods of periodical trapnesting: (1) Interval day—each trapnest day was spaced at regular intervals throughout the month, (2) Consecutive-day—the trapnest days were taken consecutively, and (3) Ran-dom-day trapnesting. The differences in efficiency among the three methods were so small that the basis for choosing one could be decided entirely upon which was the most convenient to a particular breeder. Poultry breeders today {{recognize the importance of}} selecting for high egg pro-duction on the basis of family and sire-progeny averages. It is clear, therefore, that the accuracy of such group averages is determined not only by the precision of individual records, but also by the num-ber of individual birds on which the group average is based. The relative importance of these two factors as they contribute to the error of a group mean was also con-sidered in the same paper. The results showed that the accuracy lost by trap-nesting on a half-time basis could be re-covered by increasing group size by only 7 percent. The accuracy lost by trapnesting one day per <b>week</b> could be <b>compensated</b> by increasing group size by 25 percent.

40|$|Ischaemic {{heart disease}} is most {{prevalent}} in the ageing population and often exists with other comorbidities; however the majority of laboratory research uses young, healthy animal models. Several recent workshops and focus meetings have highlighted the importance of using clinically relevant models to help aid translation to realistic patient populations.

CrT-OE mice and wild-type controls were subjected to transverse aortic constriction for two <b>weeks</b> to induce <b>compensated</b> left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Hearts were retrogradely perfused in Langendorff mode for 15 minutes, followed by 20 minutes ischaemia and 30 minutes reperfusion. CrT-OE hearts exhibited significantly improved functional recovery (Rate pressure product) during reperfusion compared to WT littermates (76 % of baseline vs. 59 %, respectively, P = 0. 02). Aged CrT-OE mouse hearts (78 ± 5 weeks) also had enhanced recovery following 15 minutes ischaemia (104 % of baseline vs. 67 %, P = 0. 0007). The cardioprotective effect of hypothermic high K+ cardioplegic arrest, as used during cardiac surgery and donor heart transplant, was further enhanced in prolonged ischaemia (90 minutes) in CrT-OE Langendorff perfused mouse hearts (76 % of baseline vs. 55 % of baseline as seen in WT hearts, P = 0. 02).
