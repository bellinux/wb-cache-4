50|$|The main {{processes}} of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and pedoturbation due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They {{are defined as}} soils containing at all depths no more than 10 percent <b>weatherable</b> minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. In addition they also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter.|$|E
50|$|In USDA soil taxonomy, orthents {{are defined}} as entisols that lack horizon {{development}} due to either steep slopes or parent materials that contain no permanent <b>weatherable</b> minerals (such as ironstone). Typically, Orthents are exceedingly shallow soils. They are {{often referred to as}} skeletal soils or, in the FAO soil classification, as lithosols. The basic requirement for recognition of an orthent is that any former soil has been either completely removed or so truncated that the diagnostic horizons typical of all orders other than entisols are absent.|$|E
50|$|Most orthents {{are found}} in very steep, mountainous regions where {{erodible}} material is so rapidly removed by erosion that a permanent covering of deep soil cannot establish itself. Such conditions occur in almost all {{regions of the world}} where steep slopes are prevalent. In Australia and a few regions of Africa, orthents occur in flat terrain because the parent rock contains absolutely no <b>weatherable</b> minerals except short-lived additions from rainfall, so that there is no breaking down of the minerals (chiefly iron oxides) in the rock.|$|E

The term coarse-silty indicates that the subsoil has less than 18 percent clay with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine. The term mixed suggests that no one mineral is over 60 percent. Thermic refers to an average annual soil temperature between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius (59 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit) and differs more than 5 degrees Celsius (9 Â°F) between winter and summer at 50 cm (20 inches) below the surface.|$|E
50|$|Ultisols, {{commonly}} known as red clay soils, are one of twelve soil orders in the United States Department of Agriculture soil taxonomy. They are defined as mineral soils which contain no calcareous material anywhere within the soil, have less than 10% <b>weatherable</b> minerals in the extreme top layer of soil, and have less than 35% base saturation throughout the soil. Ultisols occur in humid temperate or tropical regions. While the term is usually applied to the red clay soils of the Southern United States, ultisols are also found in regions of Africa, Asia, and South America. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources system, most ultisols are known as acrisols. Others with higher-activity clays are classed as alisols or nitisols.|$|E

50|$|During the Mesozoic the paleopedological record {{tends to}} be poor, {{probably}} because the absence of mountain-building and glaciation meant that most surface soils were very old and were constantly being weathered of what <b>weatherable</b> materials remained. Oxisols and orthents are the dominant groups, though a few more fertile soils have been found, such as the extensive andisols mentioned earlier from Jurassic Siberia. Evidence for widespread deeply weathered soils in the Paleocene {{can be seen in}} abundant oxisols and ultisols in now-heavily glaciated Scotland and Antarctica. Mollisols, the major agricultural soils of the present, are unique in their geological youth, being known from the Eocene but common only from the Miocene, as grasslands evolved. The most abundant paleopedological record is that of the Quaternary with few soils different from types widely found today.|$|E
50|$|Today, vinyl siding is {{manufactured}} by co-extrusion. Two layers of PVC are {{laid down in}} a continuous extrusion process; the top layer is <b>weatherable</b> and durable material, which comprises up to 25% of the siding thickness.

Vinyl siding that is exposed to the sun will begin to fade over time. However, the fade rate is slower with vinyl than most other claddings.

5000|$|It is {{believed}} that large quantities of water and carbon dioxide ices remain frozen within the regolith in the equatorial parts of Mars and on its surface at higher latitudes. Water contents of Martian regolith range from <2% by weight to more than 60%. The presence of olivine, which is an easily <b>weatherable</b> primary mineral, has been interpreted to mean that physical rather than chemical weathering processes currently dominate on Mars. High concentrations of ice in soils {{are thought to be}} the cause of accelerated soil creep, which forms the rounded [...] "softened terrain" [...] characteristic of the Martian midlatitudes. In June, 2008, the Phoenix Lander returned data showing Martian soil to be slightly alkaline and containing vital nutrients such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride, all of which are necessary for living organisms to grow. Scientists compared the soil near Mars' north pole to that of backyard gardens on Earth, and concluded that it could be suitable for growth of plants. However, in August, 2008, the Phoenix Lander conducted simple chemistry experiments, mixing water from Earth with Martian soil in an attempt to test its pH, and discovered traces of the salt perchlorate, while also confirming many scientists' theories that the Martian surface was considerably basic, measuring at 8.3. The presence of the perchlorate, if confirmed, would make Martian soil more exotic than previously believed. Further testing is necessary to eliminate the possibility of the perchlorate readings being caused by terrestrial sources, which may have migrated from the spacecraft either into samples or the instrumentation.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Mineralogical {{analysis}} of 3 upland soil profiles over Tyee parent {{rock from the}} Alsea Basin Area, Oregon showed clear differences among the 4 soil series represented. Soils from the area of higher precipitation (over 80 inches, approximately) had no montmorillonite, lower base saturation and cation exchange capacity, but no lower or only slightly lower amounts of <b>weatherable</b> minerals than soils from the area of lower precipitation. Only the profiles in the lower precipitation area had significant ped coatings of oriented clay. Shallow, yellowish soils, in both precipitation zones were much fresher mineralogically than the corresponding deep, red soils. The most strongly weathered profiles had contents of <b>weatherable</b> minerals too high for Latosols or Oxisols. The change with depth in the red soils suggested that these soils had not formed entirely from rock in place. Fragments of clay skins in the red soils suggested that these soils had developed, with mixing, from older soils.

40|$|Soils {{derived from}} loess are {{extensive}} in Europe and are {{well suited for}} forestry. They are suspected to be poor acid buffers, however. We have estimated the weathering stage and acid neutralizing capacity of acid soils under forest in a toposequence on loess in the Belgian silt belt. The soils vary distinctly in morphology and physico-chemical properties according to their topographic position. Dystric Cambisols have developed in colluvial deposits in the dry valley floors, whereas Dystric Luvisols have formed on the slopes in a rejuvenated material. The Cambisols are more acid and less saturated in bases than are Luvisols. They are strongly depleted of clay and contain less <b>weatherable</b> minerals. Easily <b>weatherable</b> minerals are concentrated mainly in the clay fraction of both soil types. Clay minerals of size < 2 mu m therefore act as major sinks for protons in these soils. A simplified expression {{taking into account the}} total reserve in bases, total aluminium and iron occluded in silicates is used to estimate acid neutralizing capacity. Our estimates confirm that these acid loessic soils are indeed poor acid buffers.

40|$|We {{have used}} a {{geographic}} information system (GIS) to study the relationships between streamwater pH and alkalinity at base flow with geology, soils and relief in 100 forested catchments located in the sandstone portion of the Vosges mountains. where atmospheric deposition and forest cover can be considered homogeneous. At base flow, streamwater acidity depends primarily on bedrock and soil content of <b>weatherable</b> minerals whose dissolution neutralizes acidity. Catchments are developed on three main stratigraphic levels, consisting of two sandstone layers rich in <b>weatherable</b> minerals, called "rich", at {{the upper and lower}} extremity of the stratigraphic sequence, and a quartzitic sandstone, called "poor", in between. Catchments were classified into three major groups in relation to the stratigraphic sequence: (1) only "poor" bedrock, (2) "rich" upstream and "poor" downstream, (3) "poor" upstream and "rich" downstream. Results showed that streamwater pH differed depending on the group. Within each group, the pH was related to bedrock, soil and relief characteristics of the catchments. The relative surface covered by the bedrock located in {{the lower part of the}} catchment explained more than 50 % of the variability of pH. More than 20 % of variability could be explained by soil types in catchments composed of poor' bedrock only. Soil type apparently did not influence streamwater pH in the other groups.

40|$|Banana plantlets (Musa acuminata cv Grande Naine) {{cultivated}} in hydroponics take up silicon proportionally to {{the concentration of}} Si in the nutrient solution (0 - 1. 66 mM Si). Here we study the Si status of banana plantlets grown under controlled greenhouse conditions on five soils developed from andesitic volcanic ash, but differing in weathering stage. The mineralogical composition of soils was inferred from X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and selective chemical/mineralogical extractions. With increasing weathering, the content of <b>weatherable</b> primary minerals decreased. Conversely, clay content increased and stable secondary minerals were increasingly dominant: gibbsite, Fe oxides, allophane, halloysite and kaolinite. The contents of biogenic Si in plant and soil were governed by the reserve of <b>weatherable</b> primary minerals. The largest concentrations of biogenic Si in plant (6. 9 - 7 g kg(- 1)) and soil (50 - 58 g kg(- 1)) occurred in the least weathered soils, where total Si content was above 225 g kg(- 1). The lowest contents of biogenic Si in plant (2. 8 - 4. 3 g kg(- 1)) and soil (8 - 31 g kg(- 1)) occurred in the most weathered desilicated soils enriched with secondary oxides and clay minerals. Our data imply that soil weathering stage directly impacted the soil-to-plant transfer of silicon, and thereby the stock of biogenic Si in a soil-plant system involving a Si-accumulating plant.

40|$|Establishment, colonization, and {{permanence}} of plants affect biogenic and physical processes leading to development of soil. Rockiness, temperature, and humidity are accepted explanations {{to the influence}} {{and the presence of}} rock-dwelling plants, but the relationship between mineral and chemical composition of rocks with plant abundance is unknown in some regions. This study documents plant species growing on rocks, their capacity as rock colonizers measured by the Importance Index, and the relationships between the chemical composition of rocks and the abundance of the dominant plant. The community is composed of eight species and is dominated by the small cactus Mammillaria fraileana. Sites with low abundance of this species contain volcanic breccias, high amounts Ca, Fe, Mg, Ti, Al, and Mn as part of moderately <b>weatherable</b> minerals, such as plagioclase and pyroxene. Sites with higher abundance contain rhyodacite, rhyolite, and andesite rocks rich in more <b>weatherable</b> minerals, such as volcanic glass and minerals containing Si, K, and Na. K and Na were present in equal proportions only at the site with more plants. Since Na is toxic for most plants, an experiment was carried out to assess its effect on the survival of M. fraileana seedlings. Decreased survival occurred as the concentration of Na increased. Even in the treatment without Na, survival decreased slightly. In summary, presence and abundance of plants is related to the type of bedrock, their weathering characteristics, and proportion of elements. The interactions among elements, rather than the isolated effect of specific elements, could be the most reliable explanation for local variations in the abundance and dominance of Mammillaria fraileana in rocky habitat in the southern Sonoran Deser...|$|E

Nature, 389, 682 - 683] showed that (ectomycorrhizal) fungi drill innumerable narrow cylindrical pores (diameter 3 - 10 m) into <b>weatherable</b> minerals in podzol E horizons. The fungi probably form micropores by exuding strongly complexing low-molecular weight organic acids at their hyphal tips, causing highly local dissolution of Al silicates. Micropores occurred in all thin sections of podzols under Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies available from Sweden (3), Finland (2), Switzerland (2), Denmark (2) and the Netherlands (3), but not in the few available thin sections of non-podzolic soils under broadleaves. Many <b>weatherable</b> minerals in the podzol E horizon appeared to be perforated, as opposed to few if any in the abruptly underlying B horizon, suggesting a link to podzolization. High concentrations of Al and Si in organic surface horizons under boreal and temperate conifers can be explained by transfer by hypha of weathering products from the minerals to mycorrhizal roots in the O horizon, followed by release of weathering products that are not taken up by the plants. Rock-eating ectomycorrhizal fungi suggest a more direct role for plants in podzolization than hitherto realized, providing tight coupling between podzolization and mineral weathering. Preliminary observations, however, indicate that mycorrhizal fungi do not play a role in podzolization under Kauri (Agathis australis) in New Zealand...|$|E

The objective {{of the study was to}} assess soil mineralogical and chemical properties of seven soils derived from different parentmaterials as an integrated strategic consideration to establish soil management. Field study was carried out in 2009. Soils were sampled from each horizon of profiles. Results showed that primary and secondary minerals had a strong effect on soil chemical properties. The sand fraction of soils derived from basalt, gabbro, mica schist and serpentinite was dominated by resistant minerals (quartz or opaques), leading to very limited, if any, nutrients released from parent materials. The clay fraction was dominated by kaolinite for soils derived frombasalt, mica schist and gabbaro, and by amorphous materials for the soil derived from serpentinite resulting in low soil cation exchange capacity (CEC). For other three soils derived from volcanic tuff, volcanic basaltic andesite and volcanic ash, the easily <b>weatherable</b> minerals (feldspar and ferromagnesian) were dominant, suggesting the high reserved nutrients. The presence of halloysite and smectite minerals in the soil derived from volcanic tuff resulted in high soil CEC, while the dominance of amorphous materials in soils derived from volcanic basaltic andesite and volcanic ash was responsible for the low CEC. Forsoils derived from basalt, serpentinite, mica schist and gabbro, therefore, the strategic management should be directed to restore soil CEC, pH, exchangeable cations and P content. For soils derived from volcanic tuff, volcanic basaltic andesite and volcanic ash, the presence of easily <b>weatherable</b> minerals indicated many reserved nutrients; hence the soil management is directed for replenishment of nutrients removed by crops...|$|E
40|$|Future {{high levels}} of {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) may increase biomass production of terrestrial plants and hence plant requirements for soil mineral nutrients to sustain a greater biomass production. Phosphorus (P), an element essential for plant growth, is found in soils both in inorganic and in organic forms. In this work, three genotypes of Populus were grown under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (FACE) for 5 years. An N fertilisation treatment was added in years 4 and 5 after planting. Using a fractionation scheme, total P was sequentially extracted using H 2 O, NaOH, HCl and HNO 3, and P determined as both molybdate (Mo) reactive and total P. Molybdate-reactive P is defined as mainly inorganic but also some labile organic P which is determined by Vanado-molybdophosphoric acid colorimetric methods. Organic P was also measured to assess all plant available and <b>weatherable</b> P pools. We tested the hypotheses that higher P demand due to increased growth is met by a depletion of easily <b>weatherable</b> soil P pools, and that increased biomass inputs increases the amount of organic P in the soil. The concentration of organic P increased under FACE, but {{was associated with a}} decrease in total soil organic matter. The greatest increase in the soil P due to elevated CO 2 was found in the HCl-extractable P fraction in the non-fertilised treatment. In the NaOH-extractable fraction the Mo-reactive P increased under FACE, but total P did not differ between ambient and FACE. The increase in both the NaOH- and HCl-extractable fractions was smaller after N addition. The results showed that elevated atmospheric CO 2 has a positive effect on soil P availability rather than leading to depletion. We suggest that the increase in the NaOH- and HCl-extractable fractions is biologically driven by organic matter mineralization, weathering and mycorrhizal hyphal turnover...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the long-term chemical and physical weathering mass balance of an anomalously thick saprolite profile (> 30 in thickness) developed in granitic rocks near Curacavi, Coastal Range of central Chile. The results of geochemical mass balance calculations for the regolith profile {{point to a}} moderate depletion for Na and Sr due to the plagioclase dissolution and precipitation of kaolinite. Furthermore, silicon shows a predominantly constant behaviour along the profile that is indicative of incongruent weathering of plagioclase, strongly suggesting that quartz dissolution conditions are not reached. In addition, low depletion of K, Mg, Ca, Rb, and Ba in the saprolite indicates a low degree of K-feldspar, biotite and hornblende weathering. Denudation rates calculated using cosmogenic Be- 10 data range from 20 to 70 m/Ma. If the saprolite thickness has reached a steady-state condition, the reported denudation rates lead to mineral residence times in {{the upper part of}} the saprolite profile of about 0. 5 to 1. 8 Ma. With such duration a higher weathering degree than observed at Curacavi would be expected. This apparent contradiction might be explained if all of the <b>weatherable</b> plagioclase has been dissolved under the present-day precipitation and temperature conditions of the Curacavi region. Therefore, we propose that the Curacavi profile could be in local equilibrium with respect to the <b>weatherable</b> fraction of plagioclase. A local equilibrium regime may be reached when the overall degree of depletion is small in a weathering profile. Uniform elemental distribution and low weathering degree in the thick weathering profile at Curacavi defy the traditional notion of weathering regimes and reveal the importance of exploratory studies in order to better understand weathering process in Mediterranean and semi-arid climate regions...|$|E

During polymerization, isomerization can occur towards the thermodynamically stable cis-trans ratio of 34 - 66 mol%.

40|$|Abstract Removals {{of forest}} biomass {{in the northeastern}} US may intensify over the coming decades due to {{increased}} demand for renewable energy. For forests to regenerate successfully following intensified harvests, the nutrients removed from the ecosystem in the harvested biomass (including N, P, Ca, Mg, and K) must be replenished {{through a combination of}} plant-available nutrients in the soil rooting zone, atmospheric inputs, weathering of primary minerals, biological N fixation, and fertilizer additions. Few previous studies (especially in North America) have measured soil nutrient pools beyond exchangeable cations, but over the long rotations common in this region, other pools which turn over more slowly are important. We constructed nutrient budgets at the rotation time scale for three harvest intensities and compared these with detailed soil data of exchangeable, organic, and primary mineral stocks of in soils sampled in 15 northern hardwood stands developed on granitic till soils in the White Mountain region of New Hampshire, USA. This comparison can be used to estimate how many times each stand might be harvested without diminishing productivity or requiring fertilization. Under 1990 s rates of N deposition, N inputs exceeded removals except in the most intensive management scenario considered. Net losses of Ca, K, Mg, and P per rotation were potentially quite severe, depending on the assumptions used. Biologically accelerated soil weathering may explain the lack of observed deficiencies in regenerating forests of the region. Sites differed widely in the long-term nutrient capital available to support additional removals before encountering limitations (e. g., a fourfold difference in available Ca, and a tenfold difference in <b>weatherable</b> Ca). Intensive short-rotation biomass removal could rapidly deplete soil nutrient capital, but traditional long rotations, even under intensive harvesting, are unlikely to induce nutrient depletion in the 21 st century. <b>Weatherable</b> P may ultimately limit biomass production on granitic bedrock (in as few as 6 rotations). Understanding whether and how soil weathering rates respond to nutrient demand will be critical to determining long-term sustainability of repeated intensive harvesting over centuries...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of biological Si cycling for dissolved silica (DSi) export from terrestrial biogeosystems {{is still in}} debate. Even in systems showing a high content of <b>weatherable</b> minerals, like Cambisols on volcanic tuff, biogenic Si (BSi) might contribute > 50 % to DSi (Gerard et al., 2008). However, the number of biogeosystem studies is rather limited for generalized conclusions. To cover one end of controlling factors on DSi, i. e., <b>weatherable</b> minerals content, we studied a forested site with absolute quartz dominance (> 95 %). Here we hypothesise minimal effects of chemical weathering of silicates on DSi. During a four year observation period (05 / 2007 â 04 / 2011), we quantified (i) internal and external Si fluxes of a temperate-humid biogeosystem (beech, 120 yr) by BIOME-BGC (version ZALF), (ii) related Si budgets, and (iii) Si pools in soil and beech, chemically {{as well as by}} SEM-EDX. For the first time two compartments of biogenic Si in soils were analysed, i. e., phytogenic and zoogenic Si pool (testate amoebae). We quantified an average Si plant uptake of 35 kg Si ha â 1 yr â 1 â most of which is recycled to the soil by litterfall â and calculated an annual biosilicification from idiosomic testate amoebae of 17 kg Si ha â 1. The comparatively high DSi concentrations (6 mg L â 1) and DSi exports (12 kg Si ha â 1 yr â 1) could not be explained by chemical weathering of feldspars or quartz dissolution. Instead, dissolution of a relictic, phytogenic Si pool seems to be the main process for the DSi observed. We identified canopy closure accompanied by a disappearance of grasses as well as the selective extraction of pine trees 30 yr ago as the most probable control for the phenomena observed. From our results we concluded the biogeosystem to be in a transient state in terms of Si cycling...|$|E

Subduction of Tethyan oceanic crust with a carpet of carbonate-rich pelagic sediments deposited during transit beneath the high-productivity equatorial belt resulted in a component flux of CO 2 delivery to the atmosphere capable to maintain high pCO 2 levels and warm climate conditions until the decarbonation factory shut down with the collision of Greater India with Asia at the Early Eocene climatic optimum at â 50 Ma. At about this time, the India continent and the highly <b>weatherable</b> Deccan Traps drifted into the equatorial humid belt where uptake of CO 2 by efficient silicate weathering further perturbed the delicate equilibrium between CO 2 input to and removal from the atmosphere toward progressively lower pCO 2 levels, thus marking the onset of a cooling trend over the Middle and Late Eocene that some suggest triggered {{the rapid expansion of}} Antarctic ice sheets at around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary...|$|E
40|$|Several {{plant species}} {{accumulate}} silicon, which {{is taken up}} by roots in soil solution. The Si concentration in soil solution can be governed by silicate dissolution and formation, and thus soil constitution. Here, we study the Si leaf content of mature banana plants (Musa acuminata cv Grande Naine) cropped on soils derived from andesitic ash in Guadeloupe through standard foliar analysis. The soils strongly differ in weathering stage and total Si content. The most desilicated soils (Andosol-Nitisol Ferralsol) occur in the wettest areas, on the Eastern slopes (Es) of the volcano exposed to rain bearing winds. Least weathered soils (Andosol-Cambisol) occur on Western slopes (Ws). The average leaf Si concentration ranges from 2. 7 to 3. 9 g kg(- 1) for bananas cropped in Es soils, and from 7. 7 to 9. 6 g kg(- 1) in Ws soils. The leaf Si concentrations are lowest for the Es gibbsite-rich Andosols and Ferralsols. The leaf Si concentration is positively correlated with soil CaCl 2 -extractable Si content, soil Si content and total reserve in <b>weatherable</b> minerals. The silicon content of banana leaves thus reveals the weathering stage of volcanic ash soils in Guadeloupe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUnlike farmland, forests {{growing on}} acidic soils {{are among the}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystems that are the least influenced or amended by man. Forests which developed on acidic soils are characterized by an important stock of inorganic nutrients entrapped in poorly <b>weatherable</b> soil minerals. In this context, the mineral-weathering process is of great importance, since such minerals are not easily accessible to tree roots. To date, several bacterial genera have been noted {{for their ability to}} weather minerals and, in the case of some of them, to improve tree nutrition. Nevertheless, few studies have focused their analyses on mineral-weathering bacterial communities in relation to geochemical cycles and soil characteristics, their ecological origin, associated tree species and forest management practices. Here we discuss the heterogeneity of the mineral-weathering process in forest soils and present what is known concerning the taxonomic and functional characteristics of mineral-weathering bacteria, as well as the different locations where they have been isolated in forest soils. We also discuss the biotic and abiotic factors that may influence the distribution of these bacteria, such as the effect of tree species or forest management practice...|$|E
40|$|Mineralogical {{composition}} of three surface soils from Urir Char â an environmentally vulnerable small offshore island of Bangladesh â {{was determined by}} X-ray diffraction analysis. In the bulk soils layer silicates and quartz were the dominant minerals while the quantity of feldspars was around ten percent. Quantity of <b>weatherable</b> minerals was very high in the soils. Illite was the dominant mineral in the clay fraction of the soils. The second dominant clay mineral was smectite which comprised around one-fourth of the clay fraction closely followed by chlorite with a small quantity of kaolinite mineral. Soil vermiculite and mixed layer minerals were absent in these soils. These soils had a mixed mineralogical composition with a high cation exchange capacity and percent base saturation. Texturally the soils were silty loam. Exchangeable Ca++ / Mg++ ratio was less than unity. Magnesium solonization was considered as the dominant pedogenic process along with gleization. There was problem of salinity as the elevation of land was around one meter above the mean sea level. Natural calamities like tropical cyclones and tidal surges were highly devastating as the island was completely washed with sea water...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{deforestation}} in the Amazon region have been accelerating, but {{the quantity and}} timing of nutrient losses from forested and deforested ecosystems are poorly understood. This paper investigates the broad variation in soil properties of the Amazon Basin as they influence transfers of plant nutrients from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere and the aquatic biosphere. The dominant lowland soils are highly weathered Oxisols and Ultisols, but significant areas of Alfisols also exist, resulting {{in a wide range}} of <b>weatherable</b> primary minerals. Despite this considerable variation among Amazonian soils, a common feature in most mature lowland Amazonian forests is a conservative P cycle and excess N availability. In cattle pastures and secondary forests, however, low rates of internal terrestrial N cycling, low N export to streams, and low gaseous N emissions from soils are common, due to significant previous losses of N through repeated fire. Export of P to streams may increase or remain nearly undetectable after forest-to-pasture conversion, depending on soil type. Oxisols exhibit very low P export, whereas increased P export to pasture streams has been observed in Ultisols of western Amazonia. Calciu...|$|E
