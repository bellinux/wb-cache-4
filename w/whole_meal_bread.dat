40|$|The {{degradation}} of endogenous wheat grain fructans, oligosaccharides with possible health-promoting potential, during wheat <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread</b> making was investigated, and several strategies {{to prevent their}} degradation were evaluated. Up to 78. 4 ± 5. 2 % of the fructans initially present in wheat whole meal were degraded during bread making {{by the action of}} yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) invertase. The addition of sucrose to dough delayed fructan degradation but had no effect on final fructan concentrations. However, yeast growth conditions and yeast genotype did have a clear impact. A 3 -fold reduction of fructan degradation could be achieved when the commercial bread yeast strain was replaced by yeast strains with lower sucrose degradation activity. Finally, fructan degradation during bread making could be prevented completely by the use of a yeast strain lacking invertase. These results show that the nutritional profile of bread can be enhanced through appropriate yeast technology. status: publishe...|$|E

The breads studied were: a low DF wheat <b>bread</b> (WF), <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> rye <b>bread</b> (GR), rye bread with kernels (RK), wheat bread supplemented with wheat arabinoxylan concentrate (AX) and wheat bread supplemented with oat β-glucan concentrate (BG). The {{weight average molecular weight}} (Mw) of extractable carbohydrates in β-glucan concentrate decreased eight-fold after inclusion in the BG bread when exposed to in vitro digestion, while the Mw of purified extractable carbohydrates in AX bread was reduced two-fold, and remained almost unaffected until reaching the terminal ileum of pigs. Similarly, the Mw of purified extractable carbohydrates in GR and RK bread was not significantly changed in the ileum. The AX bread resulted in the highest concentration of dissolved arabinoxylan in the ileum among all the breads that caused a substantial increased in ileal AX viscosity. Nevertheless, for none of the breads, the Mw of extractable carbohydrates was related neither to the bread extract nor ileal viscosity...|$|R
40|$|White and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>breads</b> {{have been}} {{classified}} as high glycemic index (GI) foods {{which in turn}} produce the greatest rise in blood glucose. One of the commercial bread products in Malaysia known as Brown breads (BB) has been recently marketed as a healthy choice for diabetics due to its low GI value. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the effect of BB when eaten with different fillings on blood glucose response among healthy individuals and to describe the influences of these fillings in reducing blood glucose response. Five test meals using BB (BB eaten with baked beans, BB eaten with vegetable, BB eaten with apple, BB eaten with roast chicken and BB eaten with seaweeds) had been prepared for this study. Postprandial blood glucose response was determined for each test meal and reference food (glucose) that contained 50 g carbohydrate respectively. A total of 21 healthy subjects were recruited by advertisement to participate. Only 20 subjects (15 males, 5 females, Mean + SD Age : 24. 4 + 3. 7 years; BMI 23. 4 + 3. 0 kgm- 2) completed this study. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed BB eaten with fillings according to the assigned group given and three repeated tests of reference food (glucose). Fasting capillary blood glucose samples were taken at time 0 and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively after the meal began. The blood glucose response was obtained by calculating the incremental area under the curve (AUC). Blood glucose response after consuming reference food (251. 8 + 12. 1 m m o l. m i n / L) w a s s i g n i f i c a n t l y h i g h e r t h a n a l l t h e t e s t m e a l s (p < 0. 05). Among the test meals, BB eaten with baked beans produced the highest rise in blood glucose (97. 0 + 16. 9 mmol. min/L) whereas BB eaten with seaweeds demonstrated the lowest response in blood glucose (33. 3 + 6. 5 mmol. min/L) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The postprandial blood glucose response after ingestion of BB when eaten with vegetable was 73. 3 + 19. 1 mmol. min/L followed by BB eaten with apple (58. 9 Jurnal Sains Kesihatan Malaysia 6 (1) 2008 : 1 - 102 + 12. 2 mmol. min/L) and BB eaten with roast chicken (56. 5 + 10. 1 mmol. min/ L). Generally, BB when eaten with fillings produced a slow rise in blood glucose response than the reference food.

40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{revealed}} the prebiotic activity of cereal derived arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS). This {{study investigated the}} in situ production of AXOS during bread making. In the first part, the AXOS producing capacity of different xylanases was compared in <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread</b> making. Three mesophilic xylanases originating from Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger and Hypocrea jecorina, and one thermophilic xylanase from H. jecorina (HjXynA), were used in different dosages. At dosages that did not impair dough manageability, HjXynA solubilised and cleaved the arabinoxylan fraction to the largest extent, resulting in an AXOS content of 2. 1 % (dry basis) and an average degree of polymerisation (avDP) of 9. In the second part, the impact of HjXynA on the AXOS levels in dietary fibre enriched breads was studied.

40|$|Abstract Background Pricing {{strategies}} are mentioned frequently as a potentially effective tool to stimulate healthy eating, mainly for consumers {{with a low}} socio-economic status. Still, {{it is not known}} how these consumers perceive pricing strategies, which pricing {{strategies are}} favoured and what contextual factors are important in achieving the anticipated effects. Methods We conducted seven focus groups among 59 residents of deprived neighbourhoods in two large Dutch cities. The focus group topics were based on insights from Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory and consisted of four parts: 1) discussion on factors in food selection; 2) attitudes and perceptions towards food prices; 3) thinking up pricing strategies; 4) attitudes and perceptions regarding nine pricing strategies that were nominated by experts in a former Delphi Study. Analyses were conducted with Atlas. ti 5. 2 computer software, using the framework approach. Results Qualitative analyses revealed that this group of consumers consider price to be a core factor in food choice and that they experience financial barriers against buying certain foods. Price was also experienced as a proficient tool to stimulate healthier food choices. Yet, consumers indicated that significant effects could only be achieved by combining price with information and promotion techniques. In general, pricing strategies focusing on encouraging healthy eating were valued to be more helpful than pricing strategies which focused on discouraging unhealthy eating. Suggested high reward strategies were: reducing the price of healthier options of comparable products (e. g., <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread)</b> compared to unhealthier options (e. g., white bread); providing a healthy food discount card for low-income groups; and combining price discounts on healthier foods with other marketing techniques such as displaying cheap and healthy foods at the cash desk. Conclusion This focus group study provides important new insights regarding the use of pricing strategies to stimulate healthy eating. The observed perceptions and attitudes of residents of deprived neighbourhoods can be integrated into future experimental studies and be used to reveal if and how pricing strategies are effective in stimulating healthy eating. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Favorable {{dietary habits}} promote health, whereas {{unfavorable}} habits link to various chronic diseases. An individual's " sense of coherence" (SOC) {{is reported to}} correlate with prevalence of some diseases to which dietary habits are linked. However, understanding what determines an individual's dietary preferences and how to change his/her behavior remains limited. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate associations between dietary intake and SOC in adults. Methods Diet intake was recorded by an 84 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and SOC was measured by the 13 -item Antonovsky questionnaire in 2, 446 men and 2, 545 women (25 – 74 years old) from the population based northern Sweden MONICA screening in 1999. Results Intakes of energy, total and saturated fat, ascorbic acid, sucrose, and servings of fruits, vegetables, cereals, and sweets correlated with SOC among women, whereas intakes of total and saturated fat, ascorbic acid, fiber, and alcohol, and servings of fruits, vegetables, bread, bread and cereals, fish, and potatoes correlated with SOC among men. With a few exceptions, intakes of these nutrients/foods were significantly explained by SOC quartile scores in linear GLM models. Both women and men classified into the highest SOC quartile had significantly higher age-BMI-education standardized mean intakes of vegetables than those in the lowest quartiles. Women in the highest SOC quartile also had higher intake of fruits but lower intakes of energy, total and saturated fat, sucrose, and sweets. Projection to latent structures (PLS) multivariate modeling of intakes of the 84 food items and food aggregates simultaneously on SOC scores supported low SOC to coincide with a presumably less health promoting dietary preference, e. g. intake of pizza, soft drinks, candies, sausages for main course, hamburgers, mashed potato, chips and other snacks, potato salad, French fries, whereas men and women with high SOC scores were characterized by e. g. high intake of rye crisp <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread,</b> boiled potato, vegetables, berries, and fruits. Conclusion Both men and women in the highest, as compared with the lowest, SOC score quartile reported more "healthy" food choices. Dietary habits for individuals in the lowest SOC quartile therefore may render a higher risk for various endemic diseases. </p...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{deals with}} {{constipation}} in immobile patients. The research {{was carried out}} by collecting data using the questionnaire method. The questionnaires were focused on immobile patients of all ages hospitalized in any units in the České Budějovice hospital, Inc. The objective of this thesis was to survey the drinking regimen and eating habits in immobile patients and to analyze their impact on the development of constipation. I set three hypotheses: The first hypothesis suggests that immobile patients´ alimentation does not include an increased requirement for dietary fiber. My research shows that patients´ diet at home contains more fruits, vegetables and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread.</b> A diet therapist hardly ever comes to see hospitalized immobile patients. Most patients are not on any diet which would limit the intake of particular nutrients. The first hypothesis was confirmed. The second hypothesis suggests that immobile patients do not observe the drinking regimen. The research data analysis shows that patients´ fluid intake is the same no matter if they stay in hospital or at home { [...] } it is about 1 - 2 litres a day. The fluid intake depends on patients´ age, weight and health condition. It is possible to say that immobile patients observe the drinking regimen. The second hypothesis was not confirmed. The third hypothesis suggests that immobile patients do not have enough privacy while they pass stool. They feel ashamed and these feelings also raise the constipation development. There is a lot to improve in this respect, the nursing staff {{should be aware of the}} fact that immobile patients need more intimacy at passing bowel motion. It is not surprising that most immobile patients feel the lack of privacy in hospital. In my opinion not enough attention is paid to the question of privacy in hospitals. This has a negative impact on patients´comfort. Patients´ diet should include more dietary fiber. Individual consultations with a diet therapist are advisable for patients. The nursing staff should also focus on the patients´ drinking regimen. The right diet and drinking regimen may contribute to constipation prevention. The empathetic, holistic, psychological and sensitive approach to patients should improve patients´ condition and alleviate their pain. Each nurse should make her best to prevent patients from feeling undignified in hospital...|$|E

Materials and methods: The aim of this study was the analysis of the correlation of T 2 DM patients’ health behaviors and their influence on the patients’ quality of life. The study was performed on a group of 50 patients from the Kuyavian–Pomeranian Voivodeship. In this study, the Health Behavior Inventory and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. The results were statistically analyzed. The study was approved by the ethics committee. Results: The intensity of severity of health behavior and satisfaction with life of T 2 DM patients depends on the gender of the patient (P< 0. 05). The analysis of the patients’ behaviors in four categories, proper eating habits (consuming vegetables, fruit, <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread),</b> health practices (daily physical activity, recreation, sleeping habits), preventive behaviors (including keeping to health recommendations), and positive mental attitude, showed substantial correlation of the Health Behavior Inventory and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The categorization of the prohealth behaviors shown by diabetics allowed us to measure the connection between the individual categories of satisfaction with life. Males with T 2 DM showed a higher satisfaction with life score than females with the same diagnosis. The analysis showed that patients with a higher intensity of health behaviors also had superior health behaviors. The resulting correlations prove a notable relationship.

40|$|The {{theme of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is Fiber and its consumption on a hospital bed. Dietary fiber {{is defined as a}} carbohydrate food ingredient that cannot be transformed by one´s own enzymes. Fiber was originally considered a ballast food component. Gradually, it was found that it is a part of food fermented by colonic bacteria. Fiber is substrate for these bacteria and they transform it into substances intended for human organism. Fiber can be divided into soluble and insoluble. Both types are essential for human nutrition. A recommended fiber intake for an adult is 30 g per day. In the practical part of the bachelor thesis, was used qualitative research method. The research sample consisted of hospital two-weeks menus. One diet was applied in the hospital facility in the Central Bohemian region and one in the South Bohemian region. Using a computer program "Nutriservis Professional" I calculated the fiber content in the individual meals. The findings were compared with the recommended daily intake published in the book called Referenční hodnoty pro příjem živin and S výživou po celý rok. I also calculated energy value, amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates of the menus. The results were compared with the recommended values. As a research I interviewed the nutritional therapists in the hospital facilities about the patient´s diet and possible solutions to health problems caused by a lack of fiber. The interviews consisted of eight open questions focused on the fiber consumption, denying of foods containing fiber. The results of calculation previewed the menu at the first hospital facility that fiber deficiency occurs primarily in a liquid diet, while for rational diet, diabetic diet and for infants and older children the fiber content is sufficient. The menu of the other hospital contains insufficient amount of fiber, especially for diabetic diet or geriatic diet reducing fat. On the other hand, diabetic diet contains a plenty of fiber. The interviews that were supposed to find out how nutritional therapists approch the fiber issues in diets brought similar responses. The hospital in the Central Bohemian region include into the diet especially fruit, vegetable, whole grain products and legumes. Older patients ages constipation suffering from bowel obstuction, intestinal disease and flatulence frequently refuse fiber, especially legumes. If a patient has health problems caused be the lack of fiber nutritional therapists usually solve this problem by education and inclusion of fruit, vegetable and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>bread</b> into the patient's diet.

There were significant differences in radical scavenging activities and phenolic contents among bran or <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> samples of Chinese black-grained wheat and selected wheat controls. Chinese black-grained wheat had the strongest scavenging activity and the highest total phenolic content among the wheat samples. The scavenging activity and total phenolic content of wheat bran was generally {{twice as high as}} that of <b>whole</b> <b>meal.</b> A positive correlation was found between DPPH radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content of bran (R = 0. 86) and <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> (R = 0. 96). In addition, HPLC analysis detected the presence of gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, vanillic, gentisic, o-coumaric acid, and ferulic acids in wheat bran. Ferulic acid content was highest among the phenolic acids. Chinese black-grained wheat may be considered as a potential source of natural antioxidants given its high free radical scavenging ability and phenolic content.

In most cases when differences in nitrogen balance values were found they were mainly due to corresponding differences in the protein digestibility. Press cake meals were slightly better utilized than <b>whole</b> <b>meals,</b> this difference was not accounted for by a corresponding difference in digestibility. Steam drying did not produce meals of better protein value than flame drying. No effect on the protein quality of herring meals was found of the preservatives sodium nitrite or formalin used during the storage of the raw material. Extraction of a <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> with light petrol did not improve the protein quality wheras extraction of another <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> with ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether and acetone improved the quality. Four foreign fish meals were of about the same protein value as Norwegian herring meal, whereas one was decidedly better. A sand-eel press cake meal was better than a <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> produced from this raw material. The <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> was of about the same protein quality as the herring meals. A flash dried whale meat meal was of about equal protein value as herring meals, but decidedly better than a slowly dried whale meal. A squid meal, a spray dried herring solubles meal and two fish off-fall meals were of decidedly poorer protein quality than the herring meals. Rennet casein was of about the same protein value as the herring meals, whereas the reference protein source, spray dried egg albumin, was better {{than all the other}} protein sources tested. Acetone dried samples of herring fillets and whole herring were of moderately better protein value than commercial herring meals. Acetone dried male herring was of poorer protein value than a corresponding sample of female herring. Acetone dried herring roe was of good protein value whereas the corresponding sample of herring milt was of poor protein value...|$|R
