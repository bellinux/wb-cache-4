500|$|Yamamoto's {{reaction}} to Kondo's failure to accomplish his mission of neutralizing Henderson Field and ensuring the safe landing of troops and supplies <b>was</b> <b>milder</b> than his earlier {{reaction to}} Abe's withdrawal, {{perhaps because of}} Imperial Navy culture and politics. Kondo, who also held the position of second {{in command of the}} Combined Fleet, {{was a member of the}} upper staff and battleship [...] "clique" [...] of the Imperial Navy while Abe was a career destroyer specialist. Admiral Kondo was not reprimanded or reassigned but instead was left in command of one of the large ship fleets based at Truk.|$|E
500|$|Apart from frozen remains, {{the only}} soft tissue known {{is from a}} {{specimen}} that was preserved in a petroleum seep in Starunia, Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths {{have been found in}} the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle, in permafrost. It appears that soft tissue was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate <b>was</b> <b>milder</b> during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded prior to discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This [...] "natural mummification" [...] required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semi-solids such as silt, mud and icy water, which then froze.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his years}} as {{president}} (known popularly in Dominican politics as simply [...] "the twelve years"), Balaguer ordered the construction of schools, hospitals, dams, roads, and many important buildings. He also presided over steady economic growth. Granted although he did fund public housing and opened public schools and expanded education during his term, also more than 3,000 Dominicans were assassinated between 1966 and 1974. Additionally over 300 politicians became millionaires during his [...] "presidency". [...] However, his administration soon developed a distinct authoritarian cast, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. Political opponents were jailed and sometimes killed, and opposition newspapers were occasionally seized. Despite his authoritarian methods, Balaguer had far less power than Trujillo, and his rule <b>was</b> <b>milder.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his first}} term in office, Jackson was forced to confront the state of South Carolina {{on the issue of the}} {{protective}} tariff. The protective tariff passed by Congress and signed into law by Jackson in 1832 <b>was</b> <b>milder</b> than that of 1828, but it further embittered many in the state. In response, several South Carolina citizens endorsed the [...] "states rights" [...] principle of [...] "nullification", which was enunciated by John C. Calhoun, Jackson's Vice President until 1832, in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest (1828). South Carolina dealt with the tariff by adopting the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared both the Tariff of 1828 and the Tariff of 1832 null and void within state borders.|$|E

Wolfenden was afraid to see the eyes open, he seemed already in imagination to picture to himself their vacant, unseeing light. Dr. Whitlett shook his head sadly.|$|E

60|$|As {{the years}} passed my seven fellow-cunies came more to {{frequent}} Fusan. It was on the south-east coast where the climate <b>was</b> <b>milder.</b> But more than climate, it lay nearest of all Cho-Sen to Japan. Across the narrow straits, just farther than the eye can see, was the one hope of escape Japan, where doubtless occasional ships of Europe came. Strong upon me is the vision of those seven ageing men on the cliffs of Fusan yearning with all their souls across the sea they would never sail again.|$|E
60|$|In {{the long}} run, I found she was {{something}} else in petticoats too. Her name was Modeste Maria Beck, née Kint: it {{ought to have been}} Ignacia. She was a charitable woman, and did a great deal of good. There never was a mistress whose rule <b>was</b> <b>milder.</b> I was told that she never once remonstrated with the intolerable Mrs. Sweeny, despite her tipsiness, disorder, and general neglect; yet Mrs. Sweeny had to go the moment her departure became convenient. I was told, too, that neither masters nor teachers were found fault with in that establishment; yet both masters and teachers were often changed: they vanished and others filled their places, none could well explain how.|$|E
6000|$|After a deep {{agony of}} many minutes, {{it seemed that}} the sorrows of Eveline were {{assuming}} a more composed character; her convulsive sobs were changed for long, low, profound sighs, and the course of her tears, though they still flowed, <b>was</b> <b>milder</b> and less violent. Her kind attendant, availing herself of these gentler symptoms, tried softly to win the spear from her lady's grasp. [...] "Let me be sentinel for a while." [...] she said, [...] "my sweet lady--I will at least scream louder than you, if any danger should approach." [...] She ventured to kiss her cheek, and throw her arms around Eveline's neck while she spoke; but a mute caress, which expressed her sense of the faithful girl's kind intentions to minister if possible to her repose, was the only answer returned. They remained for many minutes silent in the same posture,--Eveline, like an upright and tender poplar,--Rose, who encircled her lady in her arms, like the woodbine which twines around it.|$|E

60|$|Lady Anna {{was removed}} to Bedford Square, and there became subject to {{treatment}} that <b>was</b> <b>milder,</b> but not less persistent. Mrs. Bluestone lectured her daily, treating {{her with the}} utmost respect, paying to her rank a deference, which was not indeed natural to the good lady, but which was assumed, so that Lady Anna might the better comprehend the difference between her own position {{and that of the}} tailor. The girls were told nothing of the tailor,--lest the disgrace of so unnatural a partiality might shock their young minds; but they were instructed that there was danger, and that they were always, in speaking to their guest, to take it for granted that she was to become Countess Lovel. Her maid, Sarah, went with her to the Serjeant's, and was taken into a half-confidence. Lady Anna was never to be left a moment alone. She was to be a prisoner with gilded chains,--for whom a splendid, a glorious future was in prospect, if only she would accept it.|$|E
60|$|It became dark {{before we}} reached the Cholamoo lake, where we lost our way amongst glaciers, moraines, and marshes. We {{expected}} to have seen {{the lights of the}} camp, but were disappointed, and as it was freezing hard, we began to be anxious, and shouted till the echos of our voices against the opposite bank were heard by Tchebu Lama, who met us in great alarm for our safety. Our camp was pitched some way from the shore, on a broad plain, 16,900 feet above the sea.* [This, which is about the level of the lake, gives the Lachen river a fall of about 1500 feet between its source and Kongra Lama, or sixty feet per mile following its windings. From Kongra Lama to Tallum it is 140 feet per mile; from Tallum to Singtam 160 feet; and from Singtam to the plains of India 50 feet per mile. The total fall from Cholamoo lake to its exit on the plains of India is eighty-five feet per mile. Its length, following its windings, is 195 miles, upwards of double the direct distance.] A cold wind descended from Donkia; yet, though more elevated than Yeumtso, the climate of Cholamoo, from being damper and misty, <b>was</b> <b>milder.</b> The minimum thermometer fell to 14 degrees.|$|E

60|$|Felix (nothing if not modern) had succumbed {{already to}} the feeling that youth ruled the roost. Whatever his misgivings, his and Flora's sense of loss, Nedda must be given a free hand! Derek gave no outward show of his condition, and but for his little daughter's happy {{serenity}} Felix would have thought as she had thought that first night. He {{had a feeling that}} his nephew rather despised one so soaked in mildness and reputation as Felix Freeland; and he got on better with Sheila, not because she <b>was</b> <b>milder,</b> but because she was devoid of that scornful tang which clung about her brother. No! Sheila was not mild. Rich-colored, downright of speech, with her mane of short hair, she was a no less startling companion. The smile of Felix had never been more whimsically employed than during that ten-day visit. The evening John Freeland came to dinner was the highwater mark of his alarmed amusement. Mr. Cuthcott, also bidden, at Nedda's instigation, seemed to take a mischievous delight in drawing out those two young people in face of their official uncle. The pleasure of the dinner to Felix--and it was not too great--was in watching Nedda's face. She hardly spoke, but how she listened! Nor did Derek say much, but what he did say had a queer, sarcastic twinge about it.|$|E
60|$|All toys at first, I find. Up yonder, {{among the}} green holly and red berries, is the Tumbler {{with his hands}} in his pockets, who wouldn't lie down, but {{whenever}} he was put upon the floor, persisted in rolling his fat body about, until he rolled himself still, and brought those lobster eyes of his to bear upon me--when I affected to laugh very much, but in my heart of hearts was extremely doubtful of him. Close beside him is that infernal snuff-box, out of which there sprang a demoniacal Counsellor in a black gown, with an obnoxious head of hair, and a red cloth mouth, wide open, who was not to be endured on any terms, but could not be put away either; for he used suddenly, in a highly magnified state, to fly out of Mammoth Snuff-boxes in dreams, when least expected. Nor is the frog with cobbler's wax on his tail, far off; for there was no knowing where he wouldn't jump; and when he flew over the candle, and came upon one's hand with that spotted back--red on a green ground--he was horrible. The cardboard lady in a blue-silk skirt, who was stood up against the candlestick to dance, and whom I see on the same branch, <b>was</b> <b>milder,</b> and was beautiful; but I can't say as much for the larger cardboard man, who used to be hung against the wall and pulled by a string; there was a sinister expression in that nose of his; and when he got his legs round his neck (which he very often did), he was ghastly, and not a creature to be alone with.|$|E
60|$|These {{three young}} people were neighbors' children, {{dwelling}} in houses that stood {{by the side of}} the great Lexington road, along a ridgy hill that rose abruptly behind them, its brow covered with a wood, and which stretched, with one or two breaks and interruptions, into the heart of the village of Concord, the county town. It was in the side of this hill that, according to tradition, the first settlers of the village had burrowed in caverns which they had dug out for their shelter, like swallows and woodchucks. As its slope was towards the south, and its ridge and crowning woods defended them from the northern blasts and snow-drifts, it was an admirable situation for the fierce New England winter; and the temperature <b>was</b> <b>milder,</b> by several degrees, along this hill-side than on the unprotected plains, or by the river, or in any other part of Concord. So that here, during the hundred years that had elapsed since the first settlement of the place, dwellings had successively risen close to the hill's foot, and the meadow that lay on the other side of the road--a fertile tract--had been cultivated; and these three {{young people were}} the children's children's children of persons of respectability who had dwelt there,--Rose Garfield, in a small house, the site of which is still indicated by the cavity of a cellar, in which I this very past summer planted some sunflowers to thrust their great disks out from the hollow and allure the bee and the humming-bird; Robert Hagburn, in a house of somewhat more pretension, a hundred yards or so nearer to the village, standing back from the road in the broader space which the retreating hill, cloven by a gap in that place, afforded; where some elms intervened between it and the road, offering a site which some person of a natural taste for the gently picturesque had seized upon. Those same elms, or their successors, still flung a noble shade over the same old house, which the magic hand of Alcott has improved by the touch that throws grace, amiableness, and natural beauty over scenes that have little pretension in themselves.|$|E
