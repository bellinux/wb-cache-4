5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of <b>women</b> <b>often</b> bear {{a striking resemblance to}} each other.|$|E
5|$|Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British {{actress and}} screenwriter. She {{is known for}} her portrayals of reticent <b>women,</b> <b>often</b> in period dramas and {{literary}} adaptations, and playing haughty or matronly characters {{with a sense of}} irony. She is considered one of Britain's most accomplished actresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} to rush to the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the <b>women</b> <b>often</b> brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E

5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older <b>women</b> <b>often</b> have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} <b>women</b> <b>often</b> gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, <b>women</b> <b>often</b> lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Women</b> are <b>often,</b> in law or in practice, {{unable to}} access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: [...] "Too often, justice institutions, {{including}} {{the police and}} the courts, deny <b>women</b> justice". <b>Often,</b> <b>women</b> are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.|$|R
25|$|The {{claim that}} a <b>woman,</b> <b>often</b> called Pope Joan, became pope first {{appeared}} in a Dominican chronicle in 1250. It soon spread Europe-wide through preaching friars. The story grew in embellishment but centred {{on a set of}} claims.|$|R
50|$|A {{very small}} number of abductions result from - in most cases - women who kidnap babies (or other young {{children}}) to bring up as their own. These <b>women</b> are <b>often</b> unable to have children of their own, or have miscarried, and seek to satisfy their unmet psychological need by abducting a child rather than by adopting. The crime is often premeditated, with the <b>woman</b> <b>often</b> simulating pregnancy to reduce suspicion when a baby suddenly appears in the household.|$|R
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult <b>women</b> <b>often</b> also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The <b>women,</b> <b>often</b> seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, <b>women</b> <b>often</b> spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
50|$|Atroa {{appears as}} a fresh-faced blonde <b>woman,</b> <b>often</b> with an eagle {{perching}} upon her shoulder. With her sling Windstorm, she can strike the most distant foe, and with Readying's Dawn, her spherical glass talisman, {{she is able to}} melt all ice in sight.|$|R
50|$|Miss.Tic is a French artist born in Paris on 20 February 1956. She {{is known}} for her stencils of dark haired <b>woman</b> <b>often</b> seen {{in the streets of}} Paris and {{associated}} with poetry. She has been active as a street artist since 1985.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Soucouyant", whose French-derived names {{comes from}} the word [...] "to suck", is personified by a <b>woman,</b> <b>often</b> old, who sheds her skin at night and flies through the skies, {{sometimes}} as a ball of flame, to suck blood from her victims.|$|R
5|$|Major {{memorial}} themes, such as {{victory and}} death all had their symbols. Many Canadian and British soldiers are shown raising a hat or a rifle, {{a sign of}} victory first introduced into Boer War memorials. The Greek goddess Nike herself frequently appears on civic memorials, particularly in Britain and Canada, personifying victory, often pointing the way to soldiers: the image is far less, common, however, on more sombre memorials in battlefields and graveyards. Personifications of Death rarely feature on these memorials, however, probably because the emphasis is typically on the self-sacrifice of the soldiers involved, rather than their being taken or claimed by Death. Death is more typically presented through images of widows, orphans and elderly parents on memorials, all popular inter-war allegorical forms for death and grieving. Figures of <b>women</b> <b>often</b> represented peace, civilisation or wider humanity.|$|E
5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. <b>Women</b> <b>often</b> favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on marriage {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, <b>women</b> <b>often</b> married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E
6000|$|Youth is foolish; {{and does}} a <b>woman</b> <b>often</b> let her {{reasoning}} in favour of the worthier {{stand in the way}} of her perverse desire for the less worthy at such times as these? She murmured some soft words, ending with 'Do you repent?' ...|$|R
50|$|A prized aria for tenor, in C major, {{celebrating the}} {{creation}} of man, then <b>woman.</b> <b>Often</b> sung outside the context of The Creation. Although the aria relates a Biblical story, the virtues attributed to Adam (and not Eve) clearly reflect {{the values of the}} Enlightenment.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, Bedouin women have additional obstacles to accessing care. Bedouin <b>women</b> are <b>often</b> not permitted to travel alone. In circumstances where the clinic is further away from the settlement, a male relative must accompany the <b>woman</b> (<b>often</b> forfeiting a day’s wage {{in order to do}} so). Moreover, higher school dropout rates and lower employment levels among Bedouin women mean that {{they are less likely to}} speak Hebrew. If the medical practitioner does not speak Arabic, the <b>women</b> must <b>often</b> rely on their male relatives for translation, thus forfeiting any right to medical privacy. When surveyed, Bedouin women cited lack of childcare (in {{addition to}} prohibitive distances and poor infrastructure) as a top barrier to accessing health care.|$|R
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the <b>women</b> <b>often</b> make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially <b>women</b> <b>often</b> undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which <b>women</b> <b>often</b> find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

The talented and beautiful young <b>woman</b> <b>often</b> accompanied her grandparents to social events.|$|R
50|$|Programs are {{structured}} {{to promote the}} rights and fair treatment of <b>women,</b> and <b>often</b> address traditional practices or social structures that harm women and restrict community growth and well-being. <b>Women</b> are <b>often</b> the primary leaders and beneficiaries of Oxfam Canada projects, and are encouraged to take leadership roles in their communities.|$|R
50|$|In Thailand, it is {{believed}} that a certain type of banana plants may be inhabited by a spirit, Nang Tani, a type of ghost related to trees and similar plants that manifests itself as a young <b>woman.</b> <b>Often</b> people tie a length of colored satin cloth around the pseudostem of the banana plants.|$|R

60|$|Jealousy of position, cattishness, envy {{of social}} standing--these were as evident among the office-women {{as they are}} in a woman's club; and Una had to admit that woman's cruelty to <b>woman</b> <b>often</b> {{justified}} the prejudices of executives against the employment of women in business; that women were the worst foes of Woman.|$|R
50|$|Chumba is a {{traditional}} form of music and dance performed by the Garifuna people in several Central American countries. Like punta (another type of Garifuna music), chumba songs are highly polyrhythmic, but have a slower tempo. The chumba dance is a solo dance performed by a <b>woman,</b> <b>often</b> exhibiting a large degree of individual style.|$|R
