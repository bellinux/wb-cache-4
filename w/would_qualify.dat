The film earned Schwarzenegger worldwide recognition. Conan has been frequently released on home media, the sales of which had increased the film's gross to more than $300million by 2007.

5|$|Having won 15 out {{of their}} 18 ODIs leading up {{the start of the}} tournament, the {{defending}} champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the semi-finals. They had previously won the 1987 and 1999 tournaments. In contrast, some commentators considered it doubtful whether India <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for the Super Sixes stage. They had won the competition once, in 1983, but had recently lost an ODI series against West Indies at home, and were defeated heavily in their tour of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Super League, {{which started}} its inaugural season with eight franchises, {{acted in a}} {{round-robin}} format, with each team facing each other twice, home and away.

The play-offs would feature a two-legged semi-final which would pit the first place team against the fourth place team, while second and third would face off against each other. The final would then be a one-legged affair at a neutral venue.|$|E

5|$|The mid-season, non-conference {{game was}} the first meeting between the two teams; both came into the game with highly rated offenses and poorly rated defenses. Before the game the Midshipmen had a 5–4 record, most {{recently}} defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to break a streak of 43 consecutive losses to that team. Another win <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> them for a bowl game. The Mean Green held a 1–7 record, and could not become bowl eligible by winning its remaining games, but the team's offense had improved {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the best record in the other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, he was {{assigned}} to several positions that <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> him for the high commands he was to hold in later years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 4, 1920 and spent two years at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as the Adjutant-Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute, after which he was sent on a short tour in Louisiana guarding the mail. His interest in military aviation prompted him to apply for flight training at NAS Pensacola, Florida and he earned his gold wings as a Naval Aviator in 1922. Soon after, he was ordered to the Marine Air Station at Guam where he had his introduction to the semitropical islands of the Marianas with which his name was later to become so closely linked.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E

On July 28, 2010 while in Taipei to play in Yao Ming's charity game, Lin said he had not made a decision yet on whether he would represent Chinese Taipei (the name used by Taiwan in international sporting competitions). In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E

5|$|Shearer {{suffered}} an injury-hit and frustrating {{season in the}} 2000–01 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football. He managed only fivegoals in 19games in the league. The 2001–02 season was much better though; Shearer bagged 23goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for the following season's Champions League competition. One {{of the most memorable}} incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4–3 win over the Red Devils in September 2001.

The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game.|$|E
5|$|Still Alice had {{its world}} premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2014. Sony Pictures Classics, which bought the U.S. {{distribution}} {{rights for the}} film, gave it a one-week release in December 2014 so that it <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for that year's Academy Awards. After making the deal with Sony, Westmoreland and Glatzer were eager to have the film released as early as possible, partly because of Glatzer's declining health. The film began its proper theatrical run with a limited release on January 16, 2015, earning $197,000 from 12 locations on its opening weekend. On February 20, it was given a wide release, expanding to 765 theaters across the U.S. Overall, the film grossed $18,754,371 over 14 weeks in American theaters. It earned $25,130,281 in other countries for a worldwide gross of $43,884,652.|$|E
5|$|The {{field for}} the main event {{consisted}} only of 30 trucks {{instead of the usual}} 36, with the top 20 trucks in the owner's points standings guaranteed a spot. To determine the field, two-lap qualifying runs were held, which determined the starting grids for five heat races of eight laps each. The top five fastest qualifiers started on the pole for the heats, and the highest non-locked-in truck were transferred in to the main event until there were 25 trucks in the field. For drivers that did not qualify via the heats, the top four in a last-chance qualifier advance, with the final spot reserved for the most recent series champion, and if that spot is vacant, the fifth-place finisher in the LCQ <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for the main event.|$|E

5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that <b>would</b> <b>qualify</b> a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E
