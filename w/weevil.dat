5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat <b>weevil,</b> the maize <b>weevil</b> and the rice <b>weevil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Damage from Hypera postica, the alfalfa <b>weevil,</b> {{a serious}} {{introduced}} pest of forage, was substantially {{reduced by the}} introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa <b>weevil</b> in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. <b>Weevil</b> injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, <b>Weevil</b> is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. <b>Weevil</b> is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing <b>Weevil.</b> <b>Weevil</b> gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for <b>Weevil</b> to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
50|$|Because so {{many species}} exist in such diversity, the higher {{classification}} of <b>weevils</b> is {{in a state}} of flux. They are generally divided into two major divisions, the Orthoceri or primitive <b>weevils,</b> and the Gonatoceri or true <b>weevils</b> (Curculionidae). E. C. Zimmerman proposed a third division, the Heteromorphi, for several intermediate forms. Primitive <b>weevils</b> are distinguished by having straight antennae, while true <b>weevils</b> have elbowed (geniculate) antennae. The elbow occurs at the end of the scape (first antennal segment) in true <b>weevils,</b> and the scape is usually much longer than the other antennal segments. Some exceptions occur. Nanophyini are primitive <b>weevils</b> (with very long trochanters), but have long scapes and geniculate antennae. From the true <b>weevils,</b> Gonipterinae and Ramphus have short scapes and little or no elbow.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{work on the}} phylogenetic {{relationships}} in <b>weevils</b> mentions the two subfamily groups Adelognatha (short-nosed <b>weevils,</b> subfamily Entiminae) and Phanerognatha (long-nosed <b>weevils,</b> subfamilies of Curculionidae other than Entiminae) for the species of Curculionidae.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>weevils</b> of {{this group}} are {{commonly}} known as flower <b>weevils</b> or acorn and nut <b>weevils,</b> after a food commonly eaten by Curculioninae larvae and imagines [...] - [...] the reproductive organs of plants.|$|R
5|$|Rhinocyllus conicus, a seed-feeding <b>weevil,</b> was {{introduced}} to North America to control exotic musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and Canadian thistle (Cirsium arvense). However the <b>weevil</b> also attacks native thistles, harming such species as the endemic Platte thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum) by selecting larger plants (which reduced the gene pool), reducing seed production and ultimately threatening the species' survival.|$|E
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean <b>weevil,</b> broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a <b>weevil</b> which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm <b>weevil</b> larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} pelleted poultry food, while the palm <b>weevil</b> larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E
50|$|This tribe {{includes}} the largest <b>weevils</b> of the subfamily, such as palm <b>weevils.</b>|$|R
50|$|The large pine <b>weevils</b> have a {{tendency}} to attack artificially fertilized trees, especially those fertilized with phosphorus which causes greater nutritional quality of phloem for the <b>weevils</b> or make faster more attractive plants for the <b>weevils</b> due to faster growing.|$|R
25|$|Boll <b>weevils</b> was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} political epithet by Democratic Party leaders, implying that the boll <b>weevils</b> were unreliable on key votes or not team players. Most of the boll <b>weevils</b> eventually retired from office, {{or in the case}} of some such as Senators Phil Gramm and Richard Shelby, switched parties and joined the Republicans. Since 1988 the term boll <b>weevils</b> has fallen out of favor.|$|R
5|$|Veronica shows one of {{the rape}} victims (Krista Kalmus) the photo of a suspect, but she doesn’t {{recognize}} him. In criminology class, Veronica does {{a case study of}} <b>Weevil</b> (Francis Capra), and the class enjoys it. After the study, Veronica tells <b>Weevil</b> that she’s dating Logan (Jason Dohring), and he reacts negatively. Veronica then walks into Mars Investigations and finds Cyrus O’Dell and his wife (Jaime Ray Newman) talking with Keith, while Veronica herself does some detective work. Keith informs Veronica that Dean O’Dell’s stepson is dying and that he wants Keith to find the boy’s biological father. At Mercer's (Ryan Devlin) party, two masked men enter and steal everyone’s valuables, including the necklace that Lilly gave Veronica. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is failing his mechanical engineering class, a subject in which he wanted to major. Meanwhile, Keith tracks down the husband, and Veronica accuses <b>Weevil</b> of robbing the party.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the ex-boyfriend before {{learning}} that the Kurt's best friend is probably guilty. Veronica gets a disturbing phone call from Logan, so she tracks his cell phone, finding him gambling. Veronica and Logan have a fight before she learns that Keith had to stop working for a client when <b>Weevil</b> hit a suspect; Keith feels required to fire <b>Weevil.</b> Veronica tells <b>Weevil</b> the news before {{she gives him a}} job fixing the Dean’s car. Veronica confronts the best friend, but he’s not the perpetrator, and Veronica suddenly realizes that Trish is. Veronica lies to Trish about what happened to Kurt in order to elicit a true reaction from her; this plan works, and Veronica learns that Trish took the playbook in order to get him off the team. However, she lost it in the process. Kurt, Trish, and Veronica track it down to the ex-boyfriend, who gave the plays to another team to spite the couple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Weevil</b> and Logan {{continue}} {{to work together to}} solve Felix's murder and learn that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick.|$|E
50|$|C. angaria was {{isolated}} in Trinidad and Florida, found {{in association with}} palm and sugarcane <b>weevils,</b> Rhynchophorus palmarum and Metamasius hemipterus. Dauer larvae wave and are transported by adult <b>weevils.</b> The association is probably phoretic, although C. angaria can develop on dead <b>weevils.</b>|$|R
40|$|Overwintered female boll <b>weevils,</b> Anthonomus grandis Boheman, {{collected}} in grandlure- baited traps were significantly leaner than <b>weevils</b> taken from winter habitat. <b>Weevils</b> {{that emerged from}} naturally infested cotton bolls tended to be fat as adults regardless of subsequent adult diet, but adult diet can affect gonadal development. <b>Weevils</b> that emerged from bolls in 1975 in South Carolina had a higher winter survival rate and emerged from winter habitat earlier than the total population. Migrant <b>weevils</b> appear to be mainly colonizers that have some body fat and medium size gonads. The physiological condition of migrants was fairly consistent over time and location in South Carolina but not in Arizona. The time of migratory flight was related mainly to plant maturity and population levels in South Carolina. <b>Weevils</b> collected from cotton plants in South Carolina and Arizona had significantly more body fat than <b>weevils</b> trapped at the cotton field but oogenesis was variable between the two locations...|$|R
40|$|Conspicuous {{colouration}} can evolve as {{a primary}} defence mechanism that advertises unprofitability and discourages predatory attacks. Geographic overlap is a primary determinant of whether individual predators encounter, and thus learn to avoid, such aposematic prey. We experimentally tested whether the conspicuous colouration displayed by Old World pachyrhynchid <b>weevils</b> (Pachyrhynchus tobafolius and Kashotonus multipunctatus) deters predation by visual predators (Swinhoe’s tree lizard; Agamidae, Japalura swinhonis). During staged encounters, sympatric lizards attacked <b>weevils</b> without conspicuous patterns at higher rates than <b>weevils</b> with intact conspicuous patterns, whereas allopatric lizards attacked <b>weevils</b> with intact patterns at higher rates than sympatric lizards. Sympatric lizards also attacked masked <b>weevils</b> at lower rates, suggesting that other attributes of the <b>weevils</b> (size/shape/smell) also facilitate recognition. Allopatric lizards rapidly learned to avoid <b>weevils</b> after only a single encounter, and maintained aversive behaviours {{for more than three}} weeks. The imperfect ability of visual predators to recognize potential prey as unpalatable, both in the presence and absence of th...|$|R
5|$|Beetles are {{sometimes}} used as instruments: the Onabasulu of Papua New Guinea historically used the <b>weevil</b> Rhynchophorus ferrugineus as {{a musical instrument}} by letting the human mouth serve as a variable resonance chamber for the wing vibrations of the live adult beetle.|$|E
5|$|On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). On the bus home, Veronica {{talks to}} Meg one more time, {{but she is}} still passive-aggressive. Veronica {{explains}} to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a rest stop, Veronica sees <b>Weevil</b> and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, <b>Weevil</b> takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they look over at the crashed bus.|$|E
5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The <b>weevil</b> {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The <b>weevil</b> develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>weevils</b> can be {{controlled}} by using sticky barriers on the trunks of affected plants, as the <b>weevils</b> return to the soil each day.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two {{licensed}} shows on Fun Kids, Beanotown based on The Beano and Bin <b>Weevils</b> {{based on the}} Bin <b>Weevils</b> online game.|$|R
50|$|The screw-and-nut {{system has}} been found to be present in all 15 <b>weevils</b> {{examined}} by the scientists and appears to be a hitherto unknown anatomical feature of <b>weevils.</b> It has been estimated that <b>weevils</b> evolved this system about 100 million years ago. It is surmised that the development of this feature provided additional flexibility which permitted <b>weevils</b> to improve their climbing abilities, helped them keep steady when at rest, and to give a stronger leverage for piercing by the snout.|$|R
5|$|The {{broad bean}} <b>weevil,</b> B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces in spring in faba bean crops, lays eggs {{on the young}} pods, {{develops}} in the growing seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E
5|$|Two {{invertebrate}} taxa are {{endemic to}} Lundy, with both feeding on the endemic Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii). These are the Lundy {{cabbage flea beetle}} (Psylliodes luridipennis), a species of leaf beetle (family Chrysomelidae) and the Lundy cabbage <b>weevil</b> (Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes), a variety of true <b>weevil</b> (family Curculionidae). In addition, the Lundy cabbage is the main host of a flightless form of Psylliodes napi (another species of flea beetle) and {{a wide variety of}} other invertebrate species which are not endemic to the island. Another resident invertebrate of note is Atypus affinis, the only British species of purseweb spider.|$|E
5|$|Veronica goes to Dean O’Dell {{and asks}} for an exchange: Veronica tells him that his son spray-painted his car, and he will hire <b>Weevil.</b> Veronica talks to the {{gambling}} owner, who acts strangely. Veronica tracks his car before removing the tracker later. Veronica talks to Trish, who says that Kurt left for Kansas. <b>Weevil</b> starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the feminists and the fraternity boys. In {{the middle of the}} show, the feminists get a text that says that Claire, the girl who the fraternity boys pointed out, was raped. Veronica and Logan reconcile their relationship and kiss.|$|E
50|$|Giraffe <b>weevils</b> have a {{distinctive}} elongated head, and reddish-brown markings on their elytra. They {{are the only}} <b>weevils</b> {{in the world with}} a visible scutellum.|$|R
50|$|Bin <b>Weevils</b> first {{appeared}} as a cartoon series on Nickelodeon in 2003. Following {{the success of the}} cartoons, an online virtual world was made on the Nickelodeon site called 'Bin Weevils'. This online game was very successful, so in 2007, Bin <b>Weevils</b> launched their own separate site from Nickelodeon. Although still owned by Nick, the new website featured separate pages for parents, blogs, etc. In April 2010, it was announced that Bin <b>Weevils</b> would be going through a massive re-vamp. This occurred a few weeks later, and Bin <b>Weevils</b> re-innovated the game's website along with the whole game and was no longer owned by Nickelodeon, but became owned by its own company, Bin <b>Weevils,</b> Ltd.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{considered}} a subfamily of Attelabidae within the Curculionoidea (<b>weevils</b> and relatives), the tooth-nosed snout <b>weevils</b> {{are regarded as}} a separate family Rhynchitidae by some authorities.|$|R
5|$|Veronica {{is called}} {{into a room}} in the library by Jenny’s group, who try to bribe her into not turning them in to the Hearst police. However, she denies and records their {{conversation}} as further proof. They are hiding a third ID machine, and Veronica tells <b>Weevil</b> to go and find it. Dick shows Logan a sex tape of Piz and Veronica that has been circulating in an email. Because Logan thinks Piz posted the tape, he attacks Piz and hits him incessantly. <b>Weevil</b> does have a student ID machine, and Logan walks into Mars Investigations with Piz’s blood on him.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{watches a}} {{football}} practice before she expresses her frustration with Logan (Jason Dohring). Later, she meets <b>Weevil</b> (Francis Capra), {{who is working}} at a car wash. Veronica is called into the Dean O'Dell's office, and he threatens her with expulsion if she does not give up some names {{in relation to the}} sorority marijuana scandal. Piz calls Veronica in to help a football player, Kurt Fenstermacher, retrieve his playbook, with Kurt's girlfriend, Trish (Lindsey McKeon) paying for the investigation. Veronica's only suggestion is that he gets a new one. Veronica convinces her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), to hire <b>Weevil</b> as his new assistant at Mars Investigations. In an attempt to print a playbook for Kurt, Veronica disguises herself as a cheerleader, but fails to print one. After being called back into the Dean's office, Veronica is in the room during a debate between fraternity boys and feminists. Veronica goes back to the football player, and she hypothesizes that his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend stole it. <b>Weevil</b> helps Keith at detective work, succeeding beyond Keith's expectations.|$|E
5|$|At the meeting, Dean O’Dell’s wife {{asks the}} ex-husband {{to give their}} son a bone marrow transplant. Meanwhile, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) arrests <b>Weevil</b> for the robbery. Veronica visits <b>Weevil</b> in prison before she decides to look into a pizza {{delivered}} to Weevil’s house. Sheriff Lamb tells Keith that the ex-husband has disappeared before accusing Keith in the ex-husband’s disappearance. Keith thinks that Dean O’Dell {{was involved in the}} disappearance, but when he visits Dean, it turns out that Dean's wife and stepson have disappeared to a hospital in Mexico, presumably taking the ex-husband with them. Wallace visits a “tutor”, who gives him a mysterious “study guide” before going back to for the “answers.” Veronica notices the masks being used in a short film, but they were stolen. When they are in Mexico, Dean O’Dell reveals that he lied to Keith about their whereabouts.|$|E
40|$|Grooming and {{avoidance}} of contaminated areas {{are among the}} behavioural defences employed by animals against parasites. Antiparasite defence behaviour is costly in terms of time, energy and/or food foregone and therefore animals are expected to modulate their defences depending on the risk of attack and/or {{the severity of the}} symptoms caused. We tested the hypothesis that an insect host invests more in defence against more virulent (more likely to cause death) than less virulent parasites. We tested avoidance and grooming of adult pine <b>weevils,</b> Hylobius abietis, in response to infective juveniles of two species of entomopathogenic nematodes, the more virulent Steinernema carpocapsae and less virulent Heterorhabditis downesi. <b>Weevils</b> avoided feeding on a substrate contaminated with S. carpocapsae but not H. downesi. <b>Weevils</b> also groomed more when their bodies were contaminated with S. carpocapsae than either H. downesi or water. We also made direct observations of nematodes on <b>weevils.</b> When equal numbers of nematodes were applied to <b>weevils</b> more S. carpocapsae than H. downesi moved actively on the <b>weevil’s</b> cuticle. Thus, the differential response of <b>weevils</b> to the two nematode species {{can be explained by the}} <b>weevils</b> detecting the more aggressive behaviour of S. carpocapsae than H. downesi, which corresponds to a higher probability of death...|$|R
50|$|Two <b>weevils,</b> Microlarinus lareynii and M. lypriformis, {{native to}} India, France, and Italy, were {{introduced}} into the United States as biocontrol agents in 1961. Both species of <b>weevils</b> are available for purchase from biological suppliers, but purchase and release is not often recommended because <b>weevils</b> collected from other areas may not survive at the purchaser's location.|$|R
40|$|Each summer since 1994, a few soybean fields {{throughout}} Iowa {{have been}} attacked by imported longhorned <b>weevils.</b> This insect is typically a minor pest, but serious defoliation can occur when the beetles concentrate in border rows or spots in a field. Problems typically appear in mid-June and early July. The <b>weevils</b> are almost always associated with grass, either following set-aside ground or dispersing out of adjacent pasture. The <b>weevils</b> can strip all the leaves from V 5 or smaller soybean plants, but older plants apparently produce leaves faster than the <b>weevils</b> can defoliate them...|$|R
