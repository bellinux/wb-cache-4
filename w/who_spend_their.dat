25|$|The Collegium Musicum of Free University of Berlin {{was founded}} {{during the first}} {{semester}} in 1948/49. Under conductor Karl Forster, it merged with the ensemble of the Technical University Berlin in 1954. Today, the Collegium Musicum has around 500 members from all fields of studies <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> leisure time making music. It currently consists of five ensembles: a big choir, a chamber choir, two smyphony orchestras and a big band. There are frequently events on which the Collegium Musicum plays, for instance on ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> {{lives in}} saloons or {{interiors}} with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. Here {{we have a}} clear connection with the “miserable” trend of the young Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve {{on the edges of}} bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms.|$|E
500|$|While Kelly {{completed}} his {{service in the}} U.S. Naval Air Service as a photographer from 1944 to 1946, Donen worked uncredited as a choreographer on musical films. Of this period Donen said, [...] "I practiced my craft, working with music, track and photography. I often directed the sequences. I always tried to have an original idea {{about how to do}} musical sequences." [...] Donen has stated that he was excused from military service as 4-F because of high blood pressure. When Kelly returned to civilian life, he and Donen directed and choreographed Kelly's dance scenes in Living in a Big Way. They then began work on an original story about two baseball players in the early 20th century <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> off-season as vaudevillian song and dance men. This film would eventually become Take Me Out to the Ball Game in 1949. Kelly and Donen had hoped to co-direct the film, but Freed hired Busby Berkeley instead and they only directed Kelly's dance numbers. The film starred Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin.|$|E

2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people <b>who</b> <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E

It also means the Cause, - either the “final cause” or the “efficient cause” of Aristotelian philosophy.
