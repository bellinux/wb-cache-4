25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} {{rate of descent}} and ascent {{in the water and}} be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (<b>wet,</b> <b>dry</b> or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E

The WHO further recommended that outcomes should be classified as: death, morbidity, and no morbidity. There was also consensus that the terms <b>wet,</b> <b>dry,</b> active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used.|$|E

2500|$|Galen was a philosopher, physician, {{pharmacist}} and prolific medical writer. He compiled {{an extensive}} {{record of the}} medical knowledge of his day and added his own observations.

[...] "In treatises such as On Theriac to Piso, On Theriac to Pamphilius, and On Antidotes, Galen identified theriac as a sixty-four-ingredient compound, able to cure any ill known". His work was rediscovered in the 15th century and became the authority on medicine and healing for the next two centuries. His medicine was based on the regulation of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and their properties (<b>wet,</b> <b>dry,</b> hot, and cold).|$|E

40|$|The interannual {{variability}} in the southwest U. S. monsoon {{and its relationship to}} sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is investigated via experiments conducted with the University of California, Los Angeles, atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). When the model is run without interannual variations in SSTs at the lower boundary, the simulation of the climatological mean monsoon is quite similar to the observed. In addition, the interannual precipitation variance and <b>wet</b> minus <b>dry</b> monsoon composite differences in the pre-cipitation and monsoon circulation are largely realistic. When interannual variations in SSTs are introduced, the simulated interannual precipitation variance over the southwest U. S. monsoon region does not increase. Nor do SSTs seem to be important in selecting for <b>wet</b> or <b>dry</b> monsoons in this simulation, as there is little correspondence between observed <b>wet</b> and <b>dry</b> monsoon years and simulated <b>wet</b> and <b>dry</b> years. These results were confirmed through a 20 -member ensemble of shorter seasonal simulations forced by an SST anomaly field corresponding to that observed for a <b>wet</b> minus <b>dry</b> southwest U. S. monsoon composite. When the AGCM is coupled to a mixed-layer ocean model, the pattern of SST anomalies generated in association with <b>wet</b> and <b>dry</b> monsoons is remarkably similar to that observed: there is a large area of positiv...|$|R
