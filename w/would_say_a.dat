500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] is a pretty sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{originally}} conceived several premature joke game endings if {{the player}} performed certain actions, but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped. One of these joke endings {{was triggered by}} shooting a portal onto the moon's surface, after which the player's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song, {{but the idea of}} creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game's final ending. The writers planned that Chell <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> single word during the ending, but this was not considered funny enough. In an early version of the script, Chell finds a lost [...] "tribe" [...] of turrets looking for their leader, a huge [...] "Animal King" [...] turret which can be seen in in-game videos of the retail product. As a reward, the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret, which would have followed Chell around the game without visible movement. The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline, in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts, such as a comic based on a pastiche of Garfield. The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human-like for testing purposes, but recognized that unlike the captive audience of the single-player campaign, the two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over the story, and thus the story was condensed into very basic elements.|$|E
500|$|... "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] {{was written}} and {{conceived}} by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, {{he knew it}} would not age well. [...] "I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever" [...] he said, [...] "But I wanted to capture that moment." [...] According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the [...] "best and brightest" [...] of the population was drawn to resemble a popsicle. The Simpsons staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, [...] "not-so-great" [...] celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did [...] "bust [...] chops" [...] a little bit when recording his lines. [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> line and then they'd yell cut and he'd look over at me and take a shot at me" [...] Hauge said. Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance [...] "fantastic" [...] and Scully said that he was a [...] "good sport". The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. [...] "After the career that he had in television for so long, just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me" [...] Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

2500|$|In 1909, Walter Travis, {{editor of}} The American Golfer magazine, {{described}} Maxwell as [...] "... a big, tall, powerful man with massive proportions {{and a fine}} pair of legs under him. His style is rather forceful, and perhaps, as some <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> trifle clumsy. He hits hard, but unlike many other hard hitters he is most wonderfully accurate. He employs an open stance ... and uses the Vardon grip with his right thumb down the shaft. [...] With his irons he is wonderfully accurate ... and he uses an iron putter—and his style does not look {{as if it would}} make for delicacy, but he has an extraordinarily fine touch, {{and as a matter of}} fact he was about the best putter there was at Muirfield, hardly ever missing a short one." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he recovered, he made {{a second}} effort and {{went back into the}} desert to a farther {{mountain}} by the Nile called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite Arsinoe. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned Roman fort for some 20 years. According to Athanasius, the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, [...] "If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me." [...] At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{began with}} all the wrestlers, managers, referees and agents of the WWF (except WWF Champion The Undertaker and Kane) {{standing}} on the entrance ramp. [...] Howard Finkel called for a ten-bell salute. Hart's former Nation of Domination comrades were emotional, most notably Mark Henry, who wept as he read a poem that he wrote in memory of Hart. A tribute video narrated by Vince McMahon then played on the Titan Tron. Throughout the broadcast, personal thoughts on Hart {{in the form of}} shoot interviews with various WWF Superstars were played. Before the first commercial break, such thoughts were aired from Mick Foley and Bradshaw. Foley noted that Hart was his son's favorite wrestler and had proudly gotten a haircut like Owen's, although he also said his son did not quite understand that [...] "nugget" [...] was not a term of endearment. Bradshaw talked about how Hart spent less money on the road than most wrestlers because he wanted to retire early and spend time with his family. Owen's friend and Nation of Domination partner The Rock also made a short speech before engaging in a short match against Val Venis. Test then spoke about a rib Owen pulled on him. [...] The broadcast ended with Stone Cold Steve Austin coming out for a special salute to Hart by climbing the turnbuckle and performing his famous [...] "beer-bash" [...] routine, ending with him giving a toast to Owen (whose picture was displayed on the TitanTron throughout the entire show) and leaving one beer in the ring (for Owen). The only notable absence from this show was The Undertaker as he decided to visit his real-life friend, Bret Hart. The tribute show scored a 7.2 Nielsen rating, making it the highest-rated special episode [...] in Raw history and the third highest-rated show overall. Shawn Michaels, in his Heartbreak and Triumph autobiography, notes that [...] "Owen is the only guy you could have a two-hour show for, and no-one <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> bad word about him." [...] The next day, WWF taped the episode of Raw for May 31, 1999. During that show, Jeff Jarrett defeated The Godfather to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, the title Hart was booked to win for a third time at Over the Edge. Jarrett screamed Hart's name as the belt was handed to him.|$|E

That's the first descriptor that comes to mind. After that I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> I was <b>a</b> teacher. Both {{would be just as}} important." [...] After his 2003 NEH lecture, Gates published his 2003 book, The Trials of Phillis Wheatley.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Lavender, who habitually spoke, the truth, {{looked at}} him with a sort of horror. But the young man had again {{concentrated}} his attention on his plate.
