5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left to make his <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he was old enough to make his own <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E

25|$|James Cameron {{was born}} on March 1, 1800 in Maytown, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His parents were Charles Cameron and Martha Pfoutz. His older brother, Simon, was born a year earlier, on March 8, 1799. When James was eight years old, {{the family moved to}} Northumberland County, Pennsylvania where his father died within the year at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. His mother was left with eight {{children}} and without means of support. Simon and James thus had to make their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> at an early age.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Henry {{shared his}} name with his uncle, an Anglican minister, {{and until the}} elder Patrick's death in 1777 often went as Patrick Henry Jr. Henry {{attended}} a local school until {{about the age of}} 10. There was then no academy in Hanover County, and he was tutored at home by his father. The young Henry engaged in the typical recreations of the times, such as music and dancing, and was particularly fond of hunting. Since the family's lands and slaves would for the most part pass to his older half-brother John Syme Jr., Henry needed to make his own <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> At the age of 15, he became a clerk for a local merchant, and a year later opened a store with his older brother William. The store was not successful.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1968, Oughton and Ayers {{became part}} of the Jesse James Gang, which banded {{together}} with about 40 others against the moderates. The Jesse James Gang replaced the University of Michigan SDS chapter, and Robbins, Oughton, and Ayers worked in partnership with Jim Mellen from the Revolutionary Youth Movement Group. The Vietnam War entered its third year in the middle of 1968. The early student movement had taken their moral stance from the teachings of Albert Camus, who taught that thinking men have the responsibility to find a <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> to be neither a victim or the executioner. Four events in 1968 turned the American student movement into self-proclaimed Marxist–Leninist revolutionaries: the Viet Cong's Tet Offensive, the student sit-in at Columbia University, the near-revolution in France, and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Each event helped change the way American radicals viewed their own situations.|$|E

25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> independently.|$|E

Going against types, Red's Granny was written as a thrill-seeking action hero, while the strong Woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the Grand Final and still on a high from the premiership win, Nash opened the bowling for his {{district}} club South Melbourne against Australian captain Bill Woodfull's team, Carlton. Mindful of the upcoming Test tour of England, Nash thought he could impress Woodfull by bowling him a series of short pitched deliveries, eventually hitting him over the heart (Woodfull had been hit just under the heart by Harold Larwood during the Bodyline series). Nash dismissed Woodfull caught and bowled later that over for 15 but did not realise that [...] "there was no <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> Woodfull would take this wild and slightly uncouth cricketer with him to England in the current political climate (or perhaps any other)" [...] and was not chosen for the subsequent tour of England.|$|E

5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition.

500|$|Among the cantors in his casts {{that year}} were Lazăr Zuckermann (also known as Laiser Zuckerman; as a song-and-dance man, he would {{eventually}} follow Goldfaden to New York {{and have a}} long stage career), Moishe Zilberman (also known as Silberman), and Simhe Dinman, {{as well as the}} 18-year-old Zigmund Mogulescu (Sigmund Mogulesko), who soon became a stage star. Orphaned by his teen years, Mogulescu had already made his <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as a singer not only as a soloist in the Great Synagogue of Bucharest but also as a performer in cafes, at parties, with a visiting French operetta company, and even in a church choir. Before his voice changed, he had sung with Zuckerman, Dinman, and Moses Wald in the [...] "Israelite Chorus," [...] performing at important ceremonies in the Jewish community. Mogulescu's audition for Goldfaden was a scene from Vlăduţu Mamei (Mama's Boy), which formed the basis later that year for Goldfaden's light comedy Shemdrik, oder Die Komishe Chaseneh (Shmendrik or The Comical Wedding), starring Mogulescu as the almost painfully clueless and hapless young man (a role later famously played in New York and elsewhere by actress Molly Picon).|$|E

2500|$|Lockhart's elder brother, {{also named}} George, was the {{personal}} aide de camp to Charles Edward Stuart, the 'Young Pretender', during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Upon {{the defeat of}} the rebellion at the Battle of Culloden, George Lockhart accompanied Prince Charles into exile in Paris. James Lockhart, his younger brother, was 18 years old at the time.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} education to citizenship by relating it to families’ s comprehension of the social dimension of schooling. Using a methodology of participant observation to understand the school-family relationship, and after a brief contextualization of a Portuguese low-income, multiethnic local setting, where, <b>in</b> general, <b>the</b> population has low formal education levels, the text focuses on four families to present their genealogies, their own ways of legitimise school and how the families’ s different perceptions of schooling, synthetized in different realities, projects itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> families’ educative process, <b>in</b> different <b>ways,</b> allowing <b>the</b> development of family members aspirations and outlining their own <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> One finding is that, family members legitimize schooling both for its capacity to connect different historical–social conjunctures that each family has lived and for its power to disclose labor alternatives that simplifies access to material goods as well as inclusion, and respect. In addition, family’s involvement with citizenship practices outside school emerged as an important process to value the role of school in contemporary society {{as well as to}} give a new role to school knowledge. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
2500|$|Arguably the congregant Price most {{influenced}} was {{the early}} feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, {{with the help}} of a [...] "fairy godmother" [...] whose good auspices found her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. [...] Her patron — or matron — was the well-off Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who treated her almost as a daughter. The new arrival attended services at NGUC: she was a lifelong Anglican, but, in keeping with the church's and Price's ethos of logical enquiry and individual conscience, believers of all kinds were welcomed without any expectation of conversion. The approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and in her hour of need proved kinder to her than her own family. [...] She, an unmarried woman making her own <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> was marginal to the dominant society in just the same way that the Dissenters were.|$|E
2500|$|A Tale of a Tub {{is divided}} between {{various forms of}} {{digression}} and sections of a [...] "tale". [...] The [...] "tale", or narrative, is an allegory of three brothers, Peter, Martin, and Jack, {{as they attempt to}} make their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Each brother represents one of the primary branches of Christianity in the West. This part of the book is a pun on [...] "tub", which Alexander Pope says was a common term for a Dissenter's pulpit, and a reference to Swift's own position as a clergyman. Peter (named for Saint Peter) stands in for the Roman Catholic Church. Jack (named for John Calvin, but whom Swift also connects to [...] "Jack of Leyden") represents the various dissenting Protestant churches such as Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Congregationalists and Anabaptists. The third brother, middle born and middle standing, is Martin (named for Martin Luther), whom Swift uses to represent the 'via media' of the Church of England. The brothers have inherited three wonderfully satisfactory coats (representing religious practice) by their father (representing God), and they have his will (representing the Bible) to guide them. Although the will says that the brothers are forbidden from making any changes to their coats, they do nearly nothing but alter their coats from the start. In as much as the will represents the Bible and the coat represents the practice of Christianity, the allegory of the narrative is supposed to be an apology for the Anglican church's refusal to alter its practice in accordance with Puritan demands and its continued resistance to ally with the Roman church.|$|E
