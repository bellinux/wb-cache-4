5|$|The {{following}} night, the Bears <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> {{to first}} {{place of the}} NFC North after the Lions were defeated by the Ravens. The Bears {{had the opportunity to}} clinch the division in week sixteen by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, in addition to losses by the Packers and Lions.|$|E
5|$|Kelley {{moved back}} to the infield, {{becoming}} the regular first baseman in 1901. After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL's successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL. Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder of the AL's Orioles.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds {{talked to}} St. Louis about {{acquiring}} Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games {{and finished with}} 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players {{had served as a}} union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group's new league was attempting to compete with established baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the knoll {{as was the case in}} the early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{the best}} head and {{shoulder}} faker {{in the history}} of the PBA. Opposing defenders <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> on Adornado and oftentimes would even commit fouls. That move helped Adornado lead the league in free-throws made from '80 up to '83.|$|E

25|$|Water torture: The {{victim was}} tied up and laid flat on the ground.

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Politico, Gilmore {{said that he had}} been approached to run for the Senate seat of John Warner, who announced his retirement for his senate term ending in 2009. By the end of the summer, many media outlets, most notably the Washington Post, {{thought it would be a}} foregone conclusion that Gilmore <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> into the Senate race. Gilmore's successor as governor, Mark Warner, had already announced in September, and 11th District Congressman Tom Davis had informally announced his candidacy a few days after Mark Warner's announcement.|$|E

25|$|On the {{edition of}} October 29 of Raw, Shane McMahon told his father, Vince McMahon, that {{a member of}} the WWF <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> ship to the Alliance that night. Later that same night, Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho, The Rock, Undertaker, and Kane with steel chairs. On the edition of November 1 of SmackDown!, Angle, who {{originally}} led the WWF wrestlers, explained that he represented what is great about America—he was a winner, and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side. That side included Steve Austin, a man Angle claimed knew how to win.|$|E
25|$|The Seattle Seahawks played host {{to their}} first playoff game since the 1984 season. But they were {{dominated}} by the Dolphins defense, who held them to only 171 yards, with just 32 in the second half, and sacked quarterback Jon Kitna six times, three by Trace Armstrong. Although they <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> out to a 17–10 lead in the third quarter, the Dolphins would rally back behind quarterback Dan Marino, who threw for 196 yards and a touchdown, leading his team to their first playoff win on the road since 1972 in what ultimately {{proved to be the}} final game played at the Kingdome and the final win of Marino's career.|$|E
25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night. The latter precaution was especially because of the demons called karakondžula, imagined as heavy, squat, and ugly creatures. When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E
5000|$|Ultimately, {{the sketch}} would usually end with her {{losing control of}} herself, such as falling over, {{crashing}} into a wall or destroying something. She <b>would</b> then <b>jump</b> up, compose herself, and extend {{her hands in the}} air, proclaiming [...] "Superstar!".|$|R
60|$|Again I thought Pearse <b>would</b> have <b>jumped</b> at this, but {{he leaned}} his chin on his hand, {{and looked at}} Dan, and Dan looked at him. While they were staring at each other like this, Pasiance {{came up with a}} kitten.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Bruce was {{the first}} special forces soldier to {{parachute}} into the South Atlantic during the Falklands War {{a couple of weeks}} ahead of the fleet carrying the main task force to recapture the islands and took part in Operation Mikado. While in the SAS, due to his extensive skydiving background, he was pivotal in the original trials and development of the high altitude military parachuting High & Low Opening (HAHO & HALO) tactic now routinely used as a conflict insert for Special Forces. HALO <b>jumps</b> <b>would</b> involve <b>jumping</b> at night from 29,000 feet with full oxygen support and 100 lbs additional equipment and a freefall time of approximately 120 seconds before opening the parachute at 3000 feet. HAHO <b>jumps</b> <b>would</b> involve deploying the main canopy at 26,000 feet into high airspeed and drifting down with 20-30 minutes descent time.|$|R
25|$|The MTs had {{a length}} of 5.62m and a beam of 1.62m. They were {{propelled}} by a 95horsepower Alfa Romeo AR 6cc outboard motor and developed a maximum speed of 33knots at full load. The boats were specially equipped to be launched from a surface mother ship and then make their way through obstacles such as torpedo nets. The pilot would steer the assault craft {{on a collision course}} at his target ship, and then <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> from his boat before impact and warhead detonation. The pilot's cockpit was at the rear, in order to ensure an even distribution of weight with the 330kg explosive charge inside the bow.|$|E
25|$|From 1966 to 1968, {{and again}} in the 1970s, a live dolphin was {{situated}} in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He <b>would</b> <b>jump</b> in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs and the 1970s due to stress. In the film , Snowflake, a live dolphin who does special behaviors after the Dolphins score a touchdown, was the basis of the film after he is kidnapped as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino.|$|E
25|$|Knievel and his daredevils debuted on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The {{show was}} a huge success. Knievel {{received}} several offers to host the show after their first performance. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt in which he <b>would</b> <b>jump,</b> spread-eagled, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle {{hit him in the}} groin, tossing him fifteen feet into the air. He was hospitalized {{as a result of his}} injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.|$|E
50|$|Most ALGOLs {{require that}} all {{declarations}} {{come before the}} statements in a block. In S-algol declarations may be mixed with statements because everything must be declared before it is used {{and there is no}} goto that <b>would</b> permit <b>jumping</b> past a declaration.|$|R
50|$|Struve {{faced the}} then undefeated Travis Browne on May 28, 2011, at UFC 130. Despite {{starting}} off strong, nearly locking in a D'arce choke, Struve <b>would</b> mistakenly <b>jump</b> for a flying knee, which Browne countered with a superman punch to KO Struve.|$|R
