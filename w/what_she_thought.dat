5|$|Amanita australis is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. It is found only in New Zealand, where it occurs in Leptospermum and Nothofagus forest. The species was first {{described}} by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> was a unique species, Limacella macrospora, but over 30 years later this was reduced to synonymy with A.australis.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was famous}} for telling the Queen exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for {{themselves}} during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: Mrs Freeman (Sarah) and Mrs Morley (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

25|$|A notable remark of {{hers was}} made to the English soprano Adelaide Kemble when they {{attended}} the late concert in London by the great Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, who was clearly past her prime. Asked by Kemble <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of the voice, she replied 'Ah! It is a ruin, but then so is Leonardo's Last Supper.|$|E
25|$|After Valentino's {{marriage}} with Rambova ended in 1925, the two reconciled at {{the premiere of}} Son of the Sheik when Valentino spotted Mathis with friends. When Valentino unexpectedly died in August 1926, Mathis offered up <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> would be a temporary solution; she lent him her spot in the family crypt she had purchased in Hollywood Memorial Cemetery (now called the Hollywood Forever Cemetery). However, when Mathis herself died the following year, the arrangement became permanent.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} follows Anne's adventures with her new-found friends. Episodes include her play-time {{with her friends}} Diana, a calm girl named Jane Andrews and a good-natured but often hysterical girl called Ruby Gillis, and her run-ins with the {{unpleasant}} Pye sisters Gertie and Josie; and domestic mishaps such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black, and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> was raspberry cordial but {{turned out to be}} currant wine.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> to be a tanker as it {{emerged from a}} rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning and slip under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|E
25|$|Mortimer and Isabella {{landed in}} England {{two months later}} in September 1326, and they joined forces with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. On 16 November, King Edward was taken {{prisoner}} and eventually murdered at Berkeley Castle, presumably by Mortimer's hired assassins. From 1327 to 1330, Mortimer and Isabella jointly held the Office of Regent for her son, King Edward III who was duly crowned following his father's death. Mortimer was made constable of Wallingford Castle; in September 1328, Mortimer was created Earl of March. This made Joan henceforth, the Countess of March; {{although it is not}} known <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about her husband's illegal assumption of power and flagrant affair with the Queen. What has been established is that Joan was never an active participant in her husband's insurrection against King Edward.|$|E
60|$|Joan waited {{till the}} last of the {{congregation}} had disappeared, and then joined the little pew-opener who was waiting to close the doors. Joan asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> of the sermon, but Mary Stopperton, being a little deaf, had not heard it.|$|R

25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts to be polite to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E
25|$|Tunny {{returned}} to waters off Toagel Mlungui and resumed patrols. On {{the morning of}} 29 March, she observed {{a large number of}} small vessels leaving Malakal Harbor, none worth an attack. Apparently, the enemy had somehow received word of the Fifth Fleet's impending bombing attack on Japanese installations in the Caroline Islands and made a desperate attempt to clear the area. Late in the afternoon, a larger formation appeared: the 63,000-ton battleship Musashi, the light cruiser , and three destroyers, also fleeing the expected aerial bombardment. After a daring approach, Tunny fired six torpedoes at the battleship from her bow tubes. The torpedoes passed directly under an alert destroyer of the screen which immediately hoisted flags to warn the battleship, swung parallel to the torpedo tracks, and made a run on the submarine. Tunny went deep and ran for the southwest while the destroyer dropped 38 depth charges in a short, but concentrated counterattack. One torpedo had found its mark on the battleship's bow, which caused flooding of the hydrophone compartment and 18 casualties. Toward sunset, the submarine lost contact with the formation. Later that night, she encountered <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> to be the same force and was held down for two hours by one of the escorting ships. Hits by two of Tunnys torpedoes had damaged but failed to slow the powerful battleship. However, Musashi was still forced to return to port for repairs and upgrades, which kept her out of action for most of April.|$|E
25|$|Despite that it {{was unusual}} for women to {{participate}} in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering {{in the area and}} while exploring on {{the west bank of the}} Nile had discovered <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> might be an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. She kept a diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of beading. A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by half inch opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret.|$|E

500|$|Miranda Keyes was {{voiced by}} Julie Benz in Halo 2, but Bungie recast the role for Halo 3, ostensibly {{because they wanted}} someone with an accent.

When IGN asked Benz <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of her character, she {{admitted}} she hadn't played Halo 2, even though Bungie had sent her [...] "like four copies of the game."

[...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was.
