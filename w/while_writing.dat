The music video, directed by James Foley, shows Madonna's first image makeover, featuring her with a cleaner look, shoulder-length wavy golden blond hair, conservative wardrobe and subtle make-up. This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{inserted}} the entire {{text of the}} Libellus into book I of his Historia Ecclesiastica (completed ca. 731), where it makes {{up the bulk of}} chapter 27. Bede also appears to have relied upon the Libellus <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> his prose Vita Sancti Cuthberti in about the year 720. Where Bede acquired his copy of the Libellus is not known, but it seems that by the early eighth century it was beginning to be read widely throughout northern England.|$|E

5|$|Duff was musically {{inspired}} by indie rock band The Faint and pop singers Beyoncé and Gwen Stefani. In {{contrast to the}} pop rock themes of her prior releases, Dignity takes on more of a dance sound, which she said was not her intention <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> the album. The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences {{of rock and roll}} and hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, screenwriter Chris Gerolmo {{discovered}} {{an article that}} excerpted a chapter from the book Inside Hoover's F.B.I., which chronicled the FBI's investigation into the murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. <b>While</b> <b>writing</b> a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to Frederick Zollo, who had produced Gerolmo's first screenplay Miles from Home (1988).

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>writing</b> Prisoners of the Sun, Hergé {{decided that}} he wanted to move to Argentina, and focused his {{attention}} on completing all outstanding commissions so that he could focus on his emigration.

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>writing</b> The Last of Us, Druckmann had {{a general}} {{idea of the}} events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story {{direction}} for Left Behind, he found that these events were suitable. Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters are unaware of their meaning.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} of the House in September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. <b>While</b> <b>writing</b> the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano <b>while</b> <b>writing</b> the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
