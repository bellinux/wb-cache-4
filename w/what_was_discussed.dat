500|$|District-level congresses {{convened in}} some provinces in late August, while other provinces started {{convening}} them in late September. According to the Vietnamese media, the district-level congresses mostly agreed on basic economic goals and several proposed {{amendments to the}} draft Political Report. At the Binh Tri Thien Provincial Party Organization, 250 cadres reportedly made 3,000 suggestions, [...] "including amendments to and revision of the Draft Political Report" [...] and concrete policies which featured prominently in it. The same occurred in the Standing Committee of the Hồ Chí Minh City Party Committee, where leading cadres unanimously approved a program for action and proposed changes to the draft Political Report. The Nha Trang Municipal Party Organization held a day-long conference discussing the Draft Political Report, which ended tepidly; the discussions were extended so that the delegates reached an unenthusiastic [...] "identity of views" [...] (<b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>discussed</b> is unknown as the media did not state them). While other party conferences criticized [...] the draft Political Report, several others expressed enthusiasm or unanimously supported it. Because the National Assembly failed to issue {{a draft of the}} 4th Five-Year Plan, the district-level conferences were forced to discuss mostly local economic aims because they lacked national economic data.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Morey's {{success in}} {{building}} a working steamboat, credit for the first successful steamboat line goes to Robert Fulton and his financier, Chancellor Robert Livingston. This was a cause for contention, as Morey claims that they took some of his ideas. His account, which seems more reasonable than later, derived accounts, is laid out {{in his letter to}} Duer and is as follows. The summer after the one Morey spent at Hartford, he returned to New York and gave Livingston a ride in his boat (perhaps at the advice of Benjamin Silliman — publisher of Morey's papers — who knew Livingston to be a supporter of the arts). He was impressed and offered Morey a “considerable sum” if he could improve the boat's speed to 8 miles per hour. [...] He also offered $7,000 for the rights to use his current work around New York [...] but Morey declined the offer. However, he continued working towards Livingston’s speed goal. Morey had conversations with Fulton and Livingston, and Livingston even traveled to Orford to see him (although Morey doesn’t say when or <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>discussed).</b> Later, Morey reportedly was aboard Fulton's boat and expressed to Fulton his displeasure that his ideas had netted Fulton much but nothing for himself.|$|E
6000|$|As for the wilder {{and more}} romantic {{incidents}} of this story, {{such as the}} hunting of Umslopogaas and Galazi with the wolves, or rather with the hyaenas,--for there are no true wolves in Zululand,--the author {{can only say that}} they seem to him of a sort that might well have been mythically connected with the names of those heroes. Similar beliefs and traditions are common in the records of primitive peoples. The club [...] "Watcher of the Fords," [...] or, to give its Zulu name, U-nothlola-mazibuko, is an historical weapon, chronicled by Bishop Callaway. It was once owned by a certain Undhlebekazizwa. He was an arbitrary person, for [...] "no matter <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>discussed</b> in our village, he would bring it to a conclusion with a stick." [...] But he made a good end; for when the Zulu soldiers attacked him, he killed no less than twenty of them with the Watcher, and the spears stuck in him [...] "as thick as reeds in a morass." [...] This man's strength was so great that he could kill a leopard [...] "like a fly," [...] with his hands only, much as Umslopogaas slew the traitor in this story.|$|E
