5|$|Wickersham {{estimated}} 500 {{people in}} town, and another count estimated 1,000, with 387 houses under construction, six saloons, and no churches. Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling {{for as little as}} $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of a}} post office at his settlement.|$|E

At the height of Liberal popularity they had managed to lure two United Farmers MLAs to sit in the Liberal caucus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966 Hunter {{moved to}} London, where he joined The Scenery with guitarist Miller Anderson, drummer Dave Dufort and {{keyboard}} player Dante Smith. There Hunter met Mick Ronson, then guitarist of bands the Voice and The Rats, at the Flamingo Club in London. According to Anderson, [...] "Mick {{was coming down}} the stairs ... and we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> and I said, `Mick, this is my friend, Ian [...] Patterson.'" [...] The Scenery, now with John Vernon Smith on drums, recorded tracks with Bill Farley at Regent Sound that were licensed for international release without their knowledge. Hunter and Anderson recall writing and recording [...] "To Make a Man Cry," [...] but not the B-side, [...] "Thread of Time." [...] John Vernon Smith appears on the picture sleeve, but Johnny Banks, of The Merseybeats, played on the record. Johnny Gustafson was {{also included in the}} session work. The songs were released on the Impact label, and it is unclear whether they originated from France or Belgium.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Now as Jesus <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, he {{took the}} twelve disciples aside and said to them, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the {{teachers}} of the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn {{him over to the}} Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Shelton had {{expected}} a more lofty reason; he applied {{himself to the}} Madeira in his glass. That, had been [...] "collected" [...] by his host, and its price <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up!</b> You couldn't get it every day; worth two guineas a bottle! How precious the idea that other people couldn't get it, made it seem! Liquid delight; the price <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up!</b> Soon there would be none left; immense! Absolutely no one, then, could drink it! ...|$|R

50|$|VPT is {{interpreted}} in similar ways to OBV. Generally, {{the idea is}} that volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days. So, when prices <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> VPT should <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should too. If VPT fails to go past its previous rally high then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.|$|R
6000|$|Lister's little start {{was quite}} perceptible, but he grinned. [...] "You can't go inland without taking {{somebody}} {{who knows the}} way. I think I told you we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> country to kill big game." ...|$|E
