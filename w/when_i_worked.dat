500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{on a set}} {{constructed}} at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment {{that would have been}} used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that [...] "Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere that I remember from <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> at Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery." [...] For Shearsmith, the result was that [...] "it looks shit, but it's brilliant".|$|E
2500|$|Accepting the Award, Mr Eastwood said: [...] "Any kind of {{association}} with John Ford is most directors' dream, {{as he was}} certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking and I grew up on his films. His Westerns had a great influence on me, as I think they had on everybody. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> with Sergio Leone years ago in Italy, his favorite Director was John Ford and he spoke very openly about that influence. I want to thank everybody who is here from the Irish Academy, the John Ford family and thank you to John Ford Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rucker {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Fuqua's source for Dylan's outtake years prior: [...] "I got turned onto the Pat Garrett soundtrack <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> retail back in the day. It's so different {{from a lot of}} his other stuff. It's such a cool record." [...] Rucker also previously had had some experience with crediting Dylan on a song he'd performed. His group Hootie and the Blowfish's 1995 hit single [...] "Only Wanna Be With You" [...] quotes an entire verse from Dylan's 1975 song [...] "Idiot Wind". When the record began selling big, the [...] "Dylan camp" [...] took issue, and Dylan was ultimately credited as a co-writer. As Rucker remembers, [...] "They wanted some money, and they got it. We weren't trying to rip anybody off." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the PBS series Frontline explored, MTV was {{a driving}} force that catapulted music videos to a {{mainstream}} audience, turning music videos into an art form {{as well as a}} marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: [...] "I know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And I wish there had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Nas {{confirmed}} he was collaborating on {{an album}} with reggae singer Damian Marley which {{was expected to}} be released in the fall of 2009. Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and always kind of pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that".

30|$|A {{composite}} {{variable was}} constructed in PISA that measures cooperative learning style. The composition of the cooperative learning variable includes the following: (a) in mathematics, I enjoy working with other students in groups; (b) when we work on a project in mathematics, I {{think that it is}} a good idea to combine the ideas of all the students in the group; (c) I do my best <b>work</b> in mathematics <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with other students; (d) in mathematics, I enjoy helping others to work well in a group; and (e) in mathematics, <b>I</b> learn most <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>work</b> with other students in my class.

6000|$|At {{threshing}} day, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> for {{the last}} time at the Mill, I noticed the new tendency in him. The Saxtons had always kept up a certain proud reserve. In former years, the family had moved into the parlour on threshing day, and an extra woman had been hired to wait on the men who came with the machine. This time George suggested: [...] "Let us have dinner with the men in the kitchen, Cyril. They are a rum gang. It's rather good sport mixing with them.

5000|$|When Riopelle started painting, {{he would}} attempt to finish the work in one session, {{preparing}} all the color he needed before hand: [...] "I would even go as far to say—obviously I don't use a palette, {{but the idea of}} a palette or a selection of colors that is not mine makes me uncomfortable, because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>work,</b> <b>I</b> can't waste my time searching for them.

6000|$|Lyman mused {{on these}} things as he drove the gleaming ax into the huge maple logs. He was {{something}} {{more than the usual}} hired man, being a lumberman from the Wisconsin pineries, where he had sold out his interest in a camp not three weeks before the day he began work for Bacon. He had a nice [...] "little wad o' money" [...] when he left the camp and started for La Crosse, but he had been robbed in his hotel the first night in the city, and was left nearly penniless. It was a great blow to him, for, as he said, every cent of that money [...] "stood fer hard knocks an' poor feed. When I smelt of it I could jest see the cold, frosty mornin's and the late nights. I could feel the hot sun on my back like it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> in the harvest-field. By jingo! It kind o' made my toes curl up." ...|$|E

60|$|My infatuation for the Oakland water-front {{was quite}} dead. I didn't like {{the looks of}} it, nor the life. I didn't care for the drinking, nor the {{vagrancy}} of it, and I wandered back to the Oakland Free Library and read the books with greater understanding. Then, too, my mother said I had sown my wild oats {{and it was time}} I settled down to a regular job. Also, the family needed the money. So I got a job at the jute mills--a ten-hour day at ten cents an hour. Despite my increase in strength and general efficiency, I was receiving no more than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> in the cannery several years before. But, then, there was a promise of a rise to a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months. And here, so far as John Barleycorn is concerned, began a period of innocence. I did not know what it was to take a drink from month end to month end. Not yet eighteen years old, healthy and with labour-hardened but unhurt muscles, like any young animal I needed diversion, excitement, something beyond the books and the mechanical toil.|$|E

All this union labour talk about shorter hours makes me sick--why, {{there was a time}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> ten and twelve hours a day, and I'm man enough to do it yet, if I have to. When the last agent--that was Cort--was sacked I went to Boston on my own hook and tackled the old gentleman--that's {{the only way to get}} anywhere. I couldn't bear to see the mill going to scrap, and I told him a thing or two,--I had the facts and the figures. Stephen Chippering was a big man, but he had a streak of obstinacy in him, he was conservative, you bet. I had to get it across to him there was a lot of dead wood in this plant, I had to wake him up to the fact that the twentieth century was here. He had to be shown--he was from Boston, you know--" [...] Ditmar laughed--"but he was all wool and a yard wide, and he liked me and trusted me.|$|E
60|$|Given {{these two}} prime luxuries, {{the nature of}} the country where we are to live is, I had almost said, indifferent; after that inside the garden, we can {{construct}} a country of our own. Several old trees, a considerable variety of level, several well-grown hedges to divide our garden into provinces, a good extent of old well-set turf, and thickets of shrubs and ever-greens to be cut into and cleared at the new owner’s pleasure, are the qualities to be sought for in your chosen land. Nothing is more delightful than a succession of small lawns, opening one out of the other through tall hedges; these have all the charm of the old bowling-green repeated, do not require the labour of many trimmers, and afford a series of changes. You must have much lawn against the early summer, so as to have a great field of daisies, the year’s morning frost; as you must have a wood of lilacs, to enjoy to the full the period of their blossoming. Hawthorn is another of the Spring’s ingredients; but it is even best to have a rough public lane at one side of your enclosure which, at the right season, shall become an avenue of bloom and odour. The old flowers are the best and should grow carelessly in corners. Indeed, the ideal fortune is to find an old garden, once very richly cared for, since sunk into neglect, and to tend, not repair, that neglect; it will thus have a smack of nature and wildness which skilful dispositions cannot overtake. The gardener should be an idler, and have a gross partiality to the kitchen plots: an eager or toilful gardener misbecomes the garden landscape; a tasteful gardener will be ever meddling, will keep the borders raw, and take the bloom off nature. Close adjoining, if you are in the south, an olive-yard, if in the north, a swarded apple-orchard reaching to the stream, completes your miniature domain; but this is perhaps best entered through a door in the high fruit-wall; so that you close the door behind you on your sunny plots, your hedges and evergreen jungle, when you go down to watch the apples falling in the pool. It is a golden maxim to cultivate the garden for the nose, and the eyes will take care of themselves. Nor must the ear be forgotten: without birds a garden is a prison-yard. There is a garden near Marseilles on a steep hill-side, walking by which, upon a sunny morning, your ear will suddenly be ravished with a burst of small and very cheerful singing: some score of cages being set out there to sun their occupants. This is a heavenly surprise to any passer-by; but the price paid, to keep so many ardent and winged creatures from their liberty, will make the luxury too dear for any thoughtful pleasure-lover. There is only one sort of bird that I can tolerate caged, though even then I think it hard, and that is what is called in France the Bec-d’Argent. I once had two of these pigmies in captivity; and in the quiet, hire house upon a silent street where I was then living, their song, which was not much louder than a bee’s, but airily musical, kept me in a perpetual good humour. I put the cage upon my table <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked,</b> carried it with me when I went for meals, and kept it by my head at night: the first thing in the morning, these maestrini would pipe up. But these, even if you can pardon their imprisonment, are for the house. In the garden the wild birds must plant a colony, a chorus of the lesser warblers that should be almost deafening, a blackbird in the lilacs, a nightingale down the lane, so that you must stroll to hear it, and yet a little farther, tree-tops populous with rooks.|$|E
