500|$|Braun {{was named}} the NL's Player of the Month, after batting [...]366 in July (6th in the NL) with 9 home runs (3rd), and 23 RBIs (7th). He also led the league with 76 total bases and 18 extra base hits, and was among NL leaders with 37 hits (2nd), 3 triples (2nd), and a 1.163 OPS (3rd). He had {{back-to-back}} 4-hit games, just the 5th player in team history to accomplish that feat. [...] "It's a huge honor", Braun said. [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it, you're the MVP of the National League for that month. It's definitely a big accomplishment.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|The President said, [...] "We told Laird that, ‘If {{your guy}} Moorer isn’t {{sure if it}} is {{protective}} reaction, that to protect yourselves, we would back you to the hilt.’ [...] the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Nobody's Business" [...] mixes Chicago {{stepping}} {{and house}} styles, featuring strings, piano, and a four-on-the-floor kick drum. Rihanna {{said that the}} song's lyrics show [...] "basically the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at everything regarding my personal life." [...] Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make out in a Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, New York Post sports {{reporter}} Justin Terranova {{wrote that}} the butt fumble [...] "has come to define Sanchez’s downfall with the Jets." [...] Terranova {{wrote that the}} play had unfairly overshadowed Sanchez's AFC Championship campaigns in the previous two seasons, as well as Moore's [...] "ten years manning a generally-solid Jets offensive line." [...] When Moore retired in 2013, he reflected on the play, [...] "It's amusing to me that people think it's so amusing. The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it, I don't think it should have any link to my career. I don't think it stands for what I was as a player for 10 years. I really don't give it much thought." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 2008 presidential {{election}}, Trudeau {{sent out}} strips {{to run in}} the days after the election in which Barack Obama was portrayed as the winner. Newspapers were also provided with old strips as an alternative. When asked whether he created the original strip with complete confidence in an Obama victory, Trudeau replied: [...] "'Nope, more like rational risk assessment. Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning – pretty comfortable odds. Here's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar. I figure I can survive a little egg on my face'." [...] In response, McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said, [...] "We hope the strip proves to be as predictive as it is consistently lame." ...|$|E
6000|$|I hesitated. I {{did indeed}} hesitate, poor as I was. But this devil {{of a man}} held his {{banknote}} before me whichever <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> and <b>I</b> had only two pounds left in the world! ...|$|R

60|$|I {{walked up}} and down agin, thinking. If he 'adn't, and it was found out, it would blacken his good name and break 'is pore wife's 'art. That's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it, and for his sake and 'er sake I {{determined}} to stick to it.|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, she {{released}} her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She {{said of the}} album, [...] "people could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it ... people will like your next album if it's a suck-ass one." [...] As with Alanis (1991), Now Is the Time (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"An Emotion Away", the minor adult contemporary hit [...] "No Apologies" [...] and [...] "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". It was a commercial failure, however, selling {{only a little more}} than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.|$|E
2500|$|Hathcock {{once said}} that he survived in his work because of an ability to [...] "get in the bubble", to put himself {{into a state of}} [...] "utter, complete, {{absolute}} concentration", first with his equipment, then his environment, in which every breeze and every leaf meant something, and finally on his quarry. After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job. If I don't get those bastards, then they're gonna kill a lot of these kids dressed up like Marines. That's the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996, {{the long-running}} Somalia inquiry claimed a {{prominent}} victim when General Jean Boyle {{was forced to}} resign as Chief of the Defence Staff allowing allegations that he attempted to stymie the work of the inquiry and he had committed perjury when he testified before the inquiry about his role in the alleged Somalia cover-up of 1993. That same month, David Collenette, whose position was widely seen as untenable after Boyle's resignation given that he had personally selected Boyle, resigned as Defence Minister, ostensibly because of a minor violation of the ethics rules, to be replaced with Doug Young. Young frankly admitted in an interview in late 1996 he [...] "certainly wouldn't want to be in an election campaign with the inquiry still going on". In early 1997, Young ordered the inquiry to be shut down despite the complaints from the commissioners that their work was far from done. This marked the effective end of the Somalia Affair. Speaking about the shut-down of the inquiry, one of the commissioner Peter Desbarats said: [...] "The fact that Chrétien was willing to tamper with something like an independent inquiry for the sake of what appeared to be minuscule political advantage, I just thought, Wow, if he'll do that, he'll do anything." [...] Desbarats stated that he once been a fan of Chrétien, but the shut-down of the Somalia inquiry [...] "changed the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> at him totally".|$|E
50|$|I think it's fair to {{say that}} that long period allowed me to change the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at life. Until then, for me, the {{professionals}} were gods. Now, when I see a sportsman, I see the man. The status of champion isn't enough. A champion can be a good guy as much as a bad one.|$|R
5000|$|Kurt Cobain listed {{it in his}} top fifty albums of all time. The album has {{attracted}} praise from rock musicians. Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers stated {{that the first time}} he heard the record, [...] "It completely changed the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at rock music and sent me on my trip as a bass player." ...|$|R
60|$|While I {{was being}} ordered {{about in this}} <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the great Cuff.

60|$|Even {{though he}} had gained the village while the strangers were yet below it, then was his danger the greater, for he might unwittingly come {{directly}} upon them when he returned.
