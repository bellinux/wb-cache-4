As King of England he was a personage of very considerable consequence, {{and then he came}} with a large retinue and in magnificent state. His religious predilections, too, inspired him with a very strong interest in the ecclesiastical authorities and institutions of Rome, and awakened, reciprocally, in these authorities, a strong interest in him. He made costly presents to the pope, some of which were peculiarly splendid. One was a crown of pure gold, which weighed, it is said, four pounds. Another was a sword, richly mounted in gold. There were also several utensils and vessels of Saxon form and construction, some of gold and others of silver gilt, and also a considerable number of dresses, all very richly adorned. King Ethelwolf also made a distribution in money to all the inhabitants of Rome: gold to the nobles and to the clergy, and silver to the people.

An ion hitting the exobase is immediately “removed” and really precipitates. The ions hitting the shells above are gyrating and can hit these shells several times. Then the hits on these shells with a downward velocity are used to derive a downward flux in number of hits cm− 2 s− 1. This flux is not a net flux but simply the downward flux of gyrating particles. In this study, we use the term “precipitation” in a general meaning of downgoing flux in the atmosphere.

40|$|The present text is our {{communication}} to JETC conference in Budapest (Joint European Thermodynamics conference, May 21 - 25, 2017). It discusses some issues {{referring to the}} relations between space, time and thermodynamics. Thermodynamics has {{a close relationship with}} time, if only for the discussion of irreversibility. But the concept of time remains mysterious and misunderstood for many, including in physics. In our view, it is absurd to consider the question of time alone: time is an abstract concept not to be separated from the world by giving it a substantial value. To understand time is to understand how one abstracts it from the movements of material entities (including photons) in space. To tell it short, time and space are of the same substance, i. e. movement: they are constructed by comparing different movements, and an arbitrary (left to free will) choice is made to define the boundary between them, depending on scale. Some consequences of this approach bear on the conceptual understanding of thermodynamics in general. The following statements, reconsidered in the new picture, are examined briefly: - there is no ultimate parting between equilibrium and non-equilibrium, heat and work, kinetics and (diffusion) transport, {{this is a matter of}} scale; - the concept of entropy, the attribution of an entropy to an individual particle, the interior and the exterior of a system and its boundary, the definition of the quantities proper to thermodynamics such as internal energy, heat etc., all derive from the understanding of the necessary link between the different scale levels at which to examine the system; - the constant association of the temporal variations and the spatial gradients (“space arrows”), of a fundamental nature, opens up to the conceptual unification of the two expressions of the second law, i. e. the phenomenological and the statistical ones. In total, it is possible to envisage a hierarchy of thermodynamics, moving from one scale level to another. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> define thermodynamics generically, or on the contrary define several, according to the variables and physical quantities defined. By getting more into the equations, avenues for research are derived from our point of view. The quantities must go in pairs of the type (f, g) like the pair (electric field, magnetic field) in electromagnetism, the pair (energy, momentum) in mechanics, the pair (concentration, flux) in thermodynamics etc., and verify laws expressing correlated variations with respect to time and space variables (within a relation-based thinking; these variations are the only thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>know,</b> <b>not</b> the single quantities themselves). For entropy S, we are invited to propose a pair (S, F), not S alone, which can be interpreted as a couple (entropy, entropy flux) or (probability of state, probability of trajectory). The previous equations are Lorentz invariant, which allows a better connection with relativity theory. The link between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} {{economic}} theory, carbon ETS determines {{a rise in}} marginal cost equal to the carbon opportunity cost regardless of whether carbon allowances are allocated free of charge or not. Hence, common sense would suggest that. rms in imperfectly competitive markets will pass-through into electricity prices {{only a part of}} the increase in cost. Instead, by using the load duration curve approach and the dominant. rm with competitive fringe model, the analysis proposed in this paper shows that the result is ambiguous. The increase in price can be either lower or higher than the marginal CO 2 cost depending on several structural factors: the degree of market concentration, the available capacity (whether there is excess capacity or not) and the power plant mix in the market; the allowance price and the power demand level (peak vs. off-peak hours). The empirical analysis of the Italian context (an emblematic case of imperfectly competitive market), which can be split in four sub-markets with different structural features, confirms the model predictions. Market power, therefore, can determine a significant deviation from the "full pass-through" rule but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which is the sign of this deviation, a priori, i. e. without before carefully accounting for the structural features of the power market. ...|$|E

In this manuscript, we identify a fundamental problem with the primary way in which prospective economic evaluations have been measured in prior studies, and, equally importantly, also offer a solution that we hope will push the study of prospective eco-nomic voting in exciting new directions in the future. More specifically, we argue that the standard prospective economic expectation survey question- “how will the econ-omy perform over the next 12 months? ”- contains an unacceptably large degree of measurement error. Since respondents ’ beliefs about the economic future likely de-pend in part on who wins the upcoming election, existing work utilizing pre-election surveys is problematic because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which potential economic future re-spondents are thinking of when they answer this standard question.

Using pre-election survey data from the 2008 American and Ghanaian elections, we show that the majority of voters do believe that future economic conditions will differ based on which party wins office in the upcoming election. Similar findings in both an advanced wealthy democracy and a poor patronage democracy give added weight to the manuscript’s concluding recommendation: studies designed to analyze prospective economic voting should employ conditional prospective economic evaluation questions and choice-specific econometric models...|$|E

The mean distances from the position decided by radar to that by the Loran C system were about 0. 4 nautical miles toward the south west in the sea off the north west of Kyushu, about 0. 1 nautical mile toward the north west in the sea off Yamaguchi Prefecture to Okinosima, and about 0. 1 nautical mile toward the north east in the sea off Noto Hanto. Standard deviation of the distance was 0. 3 - 0. 4 nautical miles in each area. There was a slip in the reading of time difference in 90 % of cases north of 38 °N, but the mean distance and standard deviation between two positions of the ship were about the same value as in the area south of 38 °N after correction of the slip.

40|$|Background: Several factors {{influence}} {{the levels of}} fitness in people with intellectual disabilities (King et al., 2003) including self-efficacy and social support (Jamieson, Parker, Roberts-Thomson, Lawrence, & Broughton, 2014). The objective of our study {{is to examine the}} relationship between fitness and self-efficacy and social support for activity in people with intellectual disabilities. Our hypothesis is that self-efficacy and social support will have a mild relationship to fitness. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted. We used the self efficacy and social support for activity scale for people with intellectual disabilities (SE/SS-AID). To measure the correlations we used physical fitness tests (Functional reach test, Single-leg stance with eyes open-, Single-leg stance with eyes closed, passive knee extension, calf muscle flexibility, anterior hip flexibility, functional shoulder rotation, Time-stands test, Partial sit-up test, Handgrip test, two-minute step test). The physical fitness tests was separated into four categories to provide greater specificity (strength, balance, flexibility and aerobic condition). Data from the SE/SS-AID and physical fitness tests were measured in 131 adults with ID. Results and discussion. We found important correlations between the physical fitness tests and the SE/SS-AID (Calf Muscle Flexibility = 0. 26 Anterior Hip Flexibility = 0. 23 Abdominal Strength= 0, 21). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the correlations between fitness, self-efficacy and social support for activities. Other studies have measured fitness condition and social support and self efficacy for activity with regard to the SE/SS-AID scale for people with intellectual disabilities (Skowronski, Horvat, Nocera, Roswal, & Croce, 2009) but <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the correlations between these Conclusion: The main conclusion of our studywas that we found a low correlation between some physical fitness tests and the Self Efficacy and Social Support scales for activities.

30|$|Trust {{management}} in crowdsourced systems often employs wisdom of crowds approaches [10]. In our scenarios we cannot {{make use of}} those approaches because the level of expertise needed to annotate cultural heritage artifacts restricts the potential set of users, thus making this kind of approach inapplicable or less effective. Gamification, that consists of using game mechanisms for involving users in non-game tasks, is another approach that leads to an improvement {{of the quality of}} tags gathered from crowds, as shown, for instance, in von Ahn et al. [1]. The work presented here is orthogonal to a gamified environment, as it allows us to semi-automatically evaluate the user-contributed annotations and hence to semi-automatically incentivize them. By combining the two, museums could increase the user incentiviazion (showing his reputation may be enough to incentivize a user) while curating the quality of annotations. Users that participated in the experiments that provided the datasets for our analyses did not receive monetary incentives, so leveraging incentives related to gamification and personal satisfaction (by means of reputation tracking) may reveal to be an important factor in increasing the accuracy of the tags collected. In folksonomy systems such as the Steve.Museum project, tag evaluation techniques such as comparing the presence of the tags in standard vocabularies and thesauri, determining their frequency and their popularity or agreement with other tags (see, for instance, Van Damme et al. [11]) have been employed to determine the quality of tags entered by users. Such mechanisms focus mainly on the contributed content with little or no reference to the user who authored it. Also, in folksonomy systems the crowd often manages the tags, while in our scenarios, the crowd only provides the tags, that are managed by museums or other institutions, according to specific policies.

[12] present algorithms to determine the quality of tags entered by users in a collaboratively created folksonomy, and apply them to the dataset CiteULike [13], which consists of text documents. They evaluate the relevance of user-provided tags by means of text document-based metrics. In our work, since we evaluate tags, we cannot apply document-based metrics, and since we do not have at our disposal large amounts of tags per subject, we cannot check for consistency among users tagging the same image. Similarly, we cannot compute semantic similarity based on the available annotations (like in Cattuto et al. [14]). In fact, since we do not have at our disposal image analysis software nor explicit museum policies, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if possible conflicts between tags regarding the same image are {{due to the fact that}} some are correct and some not, or to the fact that they refer to different aspects (or parts) of a complex picture. Therefore, instead of assuming one of the two cases a priori, we determine the trustworthiness of the tags on the basis of the reputation of their user or provenance stereotype. As future direction, we plan to consider also inputs from image recognition software that will help us dealing with conflicting or dubious tags. In open collaborative sites such as Wikipedia [15], where information is contributed by Web users, automated quality evaluation mechanisms have been investigated (see, for instance, De La Calzada et al. [16]). Most of these mechanisms involve computing trust from article revision histories and user groups (see Zeng et al. [17] and Wang et al. [18]). These algorithms track the changes that a particular article or piece of text has undergone over time, along with details of the users performing the changes. In our case study, tags do not have a revision history.|$|E
