Spherical, nanosized protein particles were formed {{by the addition of}} a salt (sodium chloride) and a <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> (glycofurol) to protein solutions. Various process parameters were modified to optimize the precipitation efficiency of four model proteins: lysozyme, alpha-chymotrypsin, peroxidase and beta-galactosidase.

The study {{of the structure of the}} rehydrated particles by absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism showed an absence of structural-perturbation after precipitation. Protein particles were then microencapsulated within PLGA microspheres using s/o/w technique. The average encapsulation yield was around 80 % and no loss of protein activity occurred after the encapsulation step. Additionally, a lysozyme in vitro release study showed that all of the released lysozyme was biologically active.

The oxidations were done in systems containing water-miscible organic solvents, including methanol, isopropanol, N, N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran. Of the 20 aromatic compounds tested, 9 were oxidized by lignin peroxidase {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide. These included anthracene, 1 -, 2 -, and 9 -methylanthracenes, acenaphthene, fluoranthene, pyrene, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene. Of the compounds studied, lignin peroxidase was able to oxidize those with ionization potentials of < 8 eV (measured by electron impact). The reaction products contain hydroxyl and keto groups. In one case, carbon-carbon bond cleavage, yielding anthraquinone from 9 -methylanthracene, was detected. Kinetic constants and stability characteristics of lignin peroxidase were determined by using pyrene as the substrate in systems containing different amounts of organic solvent. Benzyl alkylation of lignin peroxidase improved its activity in a system containing <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> but did not increase its resistance to inactivation at high solvent concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the real-time effects of formulation and instrumental variables on microcapsule formation via natural jet segmentation, a new microencapsulation system termed the microenvironment-controlled encapsulation (MiCE) process was developed.;Methods. A modified flow cytometer nozzle hydrodynamically focuses an inner drug and outer polymer solution emanating from a coaxial needle assembly into a two-layer compound jet. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) dissolved in a <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> resulted in formation of reservoir-type microcapsules by interfacial phase separation induced at {{the boundary between}} the PLGA solution and aqueous sheath.;Results. The MiCE process produced microcapsules with mean diameters ranging from 15 - 25 mu m. The resultant microcapsule size distribution and number of drug cores existing within each microcapsule was largely influenced by the PLGA concentration and microcapsule collection method. Higher PLGA concentrations yielded higher mean diameters of single-core microcapsules. Higher drug solution flow rates increased the core size, while higher PLGA solution flow rates increased the PLGA film thickness.;Conclusion. The MiCE microencapsulation process allows effective monitoring and control of the instrumental parameters affecting microcapsule production. However, the microcapsule collection method in this process needs to be further optimized to obtain microcapsules with desired morphologies, precise membrane thicknesses, high encapsulation efficiencies, and tight size distributions...|$|E

The present work was designed to immobilize horseradish peroxidase on Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanopraticles without modification. Results: In the present study, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized on non-modified Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles. The immobilized HRP was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray. In addition, it retained 55 % of its initial activity after 10 reuses. The optimal pH shifted from 7. 0 for soluble HRP to 7. 5 for the immobilized HRP, and the optimal temperature shifted from 40 °C to 50 °C. The immobilized HRP is more thermostable than soluble HRP. Various substrates were oxidized by the immobilized HRP with higher efficiencies than by soluble HRP.

IT-USA-SI-LLME method is based on the rapid phase separation of <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> from the aqueous phase in the presence of high concentration of salt (salting-out phenomena) under ultrasonication. In the present work, an indigenously fabricated home-made glass extraction device (8 -mL glass tube inbuilt with a self-scaled capillary tip) was utilized as the phase separation device for USA-SI-LLME. After the extraction, the upper extractant layer was narrowed into the self-scaled capillary tip by pushing the plunger plug; thus, the collection and measurement of the upper organic solvent layer was simple and convenient. The effects of various parameters on the extraction efficiency were thoroughly evaluated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, detection was linear in the concentration range of 0. 4 – 100  ng mL− 1  with correlation coefficient of 0. 9968. The limit of detection was 0. 09  ng mL− 1  and the relative standard deviations ranged between 0. 8 and 5. 3 % (n =  5).

The CA was covalently immobilized within polyurethane (PU) foam by cross-linking. Although PU foam holds water almost 12 times of its weight, {{it was found that}} adsorption isotherm of moisture on PU foam was a Type III indicating that water and PU foam were non-interacting to each other. The activities for the free and immobilized CA were estimated using para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) as the substrate. The enzyme activities were estimated in increasing volume percents of organic solvent in Tris buffer (10 - 90 %). p-NP, {{which is one of the}} products of the hydrolysis reaction of p-NPA, was characterized in the presence of organic solvents and it was observed that its aborptivities were decreased significantly as the organic solvent percentages were increased indicating that p-NP and the <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> form a complex through mostly a hydrogen bonding.

The enzyme stability in <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> at 25 degrees C is somewhat surprising: after a 24 -h incubation, the enzyme was completely active in 50 % dimethylformamide; it lost 15 % of its initial activity in 50 % methanol or 15 % ethanol.

Studies with 50 % methanol revealed that the activation was reversible and inversely related to the temperature; moreover, the solvent was demonstrated to exclusively affect the maximal velocity of catalysis, the Km values for both substrates being unchanged. Investigation was made to find out whether there was a correlation between enzyme stability, as well as activation, and hydrophobicity of the organic medium. The residual malic activity after incubation in the water/organic medium correlated inversely with the logarithm of the partition coefficient in octanol/H 2 O of the mixture used as a hydrophobicity index.

Methods: The experiments {{were designed}} to characterize the activity of cyclic nucleotides {{and the production of}} prostaglandins in human varicose and nonvaricose veins. Segments of the greater saphenous veins and the adjacent tributaries were obtained from patients who underwent vein stripping and excision of primary varicose veins. The saphenous veins from the patients who underwent peripheral arterial bypass grafting were used as controls. The segments of veins were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution in the presence of venotropic extract of Ruscus aculeatus (10 – 3 g/mL) or in <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> (dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 – 3 g/mL), for 1, 5, and 10 minutes at 37 °C. The nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, 10 – 4 g/mL) was used to block cyclic nucleotide degradation in some samples. Tissue and media samples were collected. Tissue concentrations of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP, respectively) and media concentrations of 6 -ketoprostaglandin-F 1 α (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin) and thromboxane B 2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A 2) were measured by means of radioimmunoassay. Cyclooxygenase 2 was measured with Western blot analysis. Results: The varicose veins showed greater levels of cAMP but not of cGMP at all time points as compared with the control veins. Prostanoid production was not significantly altered in the varicose veins. Stimulation with Ruscus aculeatus increased the cAMP concentration in the varicose veins but did not affect the cGMP levels. The ratio between 6 -ketoprostaglandin-F 1 α and thromboxane B 2 was two-fold greater in the varicose veins as compared with the control veins. In the presence of the extract, the ratio of 6 -ketoprostaglandin-F 1 α and thromboxane B 2 was identical in both types of veins. Cyclooxygenase 2 was not present in either the control or the varicose veins. Conclusion: These results suggest that cAMP levels are elevated in varicose veins and that they can be altered with drug treatment in varicose veins. This chemical pathway may be considered as a modulatory target to affect contraction with venotropic drugs. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 30 : 876 - 84. ...|$|E
40|$|L'environnement naturel des enzymes étant de nature aqueuse, leurs {{applications}} industrielles se sont en général limitées à des réactions mettant en jeu des substrats solubles dans l'eau. Depuis quelques années, la possibilité de faire fonctionner des enzymes dans des milieux hydrophobes (hydrocarbures, solvants organiques) a été mise en évidence, engendrant ainsi de nombreux travaux visant, d'une part à mieux comprendre les mécanismes permettant aux enzymes de rester actives dans un tel environnement et, d'autre part à explorer les nouvelles applications envisageables. Les produits pétroliers constituant {{par excellence}} le domaine des molécules hydrophobes, le présent article se propose de faire le point sur ces deux aspects, compréhension et intérêt de la catalyse enzymatique en milieu organique. Nous détaillerons ainsi les vues actuelles sur le fonctionnement des enzymes dans des solvants organiques, les différents modes de mise en oeuvre possibles et, à travers une revue de leurs applications potentielles, les principaux systèmes enzymatiques utilisés. The extension of enzymatic catalysis, classically {{carried out in}} aqueous media, to organic media can be first ascribed {{to the possibility of}} using substrates that are poorly soluble or insoluble in water. In biphasic media consisting of an aqueous phase containing the enzyme in solution and of a non <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent,</b> the enzyme is kept in a suitable aqueous environment. A variant biphasic system consists in creating reverse micelles by the addition of a surfactant in order to increase the interfacial area and thus to improve the transfers between the aqueous phase where the enzyme is located and the organic phase. In these two cases, the partition coefficient of the different reactants plays a crucial role by governing the rates and yields of reaction. Microaqueous media constitute a new system for biocatalysis in organic media. In this case, a solid enzyme is incorporated into an organic solvent, preferably a hydrophobic one, wherein it exhibits new properties, especially a higher stability and a modified selectivity. The enzymes the most studied in this type of medium are hydrolytic ones, such as lipases or proteases which can then catalyze synthesis reactions. Yet, other classes of enzymes have also been used in this way. As oil products are typical hydrophobic compounds, it was of interest in view of possible applications in the petroleum and petrochemical industries to report the present knowledge about the functioning of enzymes in organic media. The present and potential applications of the most studied enzymatic systems will be reviewed in order to point out the major points of interest of biocatalysis in organic media either for organic synthesis or for less investigated fields, such as, for instance, biodegradation of pollutants by whole cells...|$|E
30|$|What {{influence}} has {{the location of}} the substitution within BSLA? More beneficial substitutions per positions were obtained at surface-exposed positions than at buried positions (DMSO: 275 vs 96; DOx: 138 vs 21; TFE: 152 vs 29). Computational efforts should therefore preferentially target surface-exposed residues since the probability (the number of possible beneficial substitutions is per position) to identify beneficial positions at exposed positions is higher than at buried positions. Substitutions to charged amino acids on the surface of BSLA (DMSO 35 %; DOx 41 %; TFE 34 %) yielded more improved variants than the other three types of substitutions. This finding applies for all three selected organic solvents. The situation is opposite at buried position of BSLA. At buried positions substitutions to polar amino acids are strongly preferred (DMSO 44 %; DOx 52 %; TFE 38 %) over all three types of substitutions and again the trend is consistent for all three selected organic solvents: (Table  3). The top 10 organic solvent resistant BSLA variants are summarized in Additional file 1 : Table S 11 and their locations on the structure of BSLA are shown in Additional file 1 : Figure. S 4. In DMSO, 9 of 10 most beneficial substitutions were polar, suggesting the importance of enhanced interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds) between substituted residues with surrounding amino acids or waters. Similar trend was observed for the top ten beneficial substitutions towards DOx (8 out of 10 were polar), while only five of ten beneficial substitutions in TFE were polar. Substitutions within BSLA were mostly located in loops (DMSO 44 %; DOx 47 %; TFE 43 %) and on helices (DMSO 34 %; DOx 36 %; TFE 43 %) as described in detail in Additional file 1 : Table S 6. In summary, loop regions represent a preferred targeting location for improving solvent tolerance against DMSO, DOx, and TFE. A role of substitutions in loop regions to improve cosolvent resistance has previously been reported (Wintrode and Arnold 2001). Substitutions of surface located residues were in many cases reported to contribute to organic solvent resistance of enzymes (Park et al. 2012, 2013; Kawata and Ogino 2009; Martinez and Arnold 1991; Martinez et al. 1992). Ogino et al. (2007) speculated that charged substitutions on the surface prevent organic solvents molecules to diffuse into the protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PST- 01. Yedavalli and Rao (2013) performed site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) of all the amino acid positions in the loops of a BSLA to find DMSO resistant BSLA variants. In contrast to our study, six beneficial positions were identified and recombined, resulting in a final variant 6 SR with 8 -fold higher catalytic turnover in 60 vol% DMSO. Three of the six mutations increased the surface polarity suggesting that substitutions with more polar amino acids may be helpful to improve the stability of a protein in a <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent.</b>|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} {{possibilities}} for the low reaction rate at the higher ratio of t-butyl alcohol: 1) Low substrate concentration {{is directly related to}} the low reaction rate. 2) <b>Water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvents</b> cause unfolding of the protein (Klyosov et al. 1975) or elimination of water molecules from an enzyme molecule that are essential to maintain its catalytic activity (Krishna et al. 2001). Therefore, lipase may be gradually inactivated by the significant addition of t-butyl alcohol. 3) A lipase molecule is generally adsorbed on the interface between the oil/water phases, and the interfacial activation produces the catalytic activity (Grochulski et al. 1993). In the one-phase system, however, there is no interface, and the behavior of the interfacial activation would be different from that in the typical two-phase system.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) {{has become a}} source of essential information on the physiology and ecology of marine microalgae, including the study of natural plankton populations, the ground-truthing of satellite derived biomass estimations, the responses to changes in light environment, etc. The detailed information of the pigment composition of planktonic communities is usually obtained by chromatographic {{analysis of}} their pigment extracts, that are prepared in a process that (very briefly) implies the sampling of natural waters from adequate depths in the course of oceanographic campaigns, the filtration of quite large volumes of water onto glass-fiber filters (25 or 47 mm diameter), and then the extraction of the filters with minimum volumes of 2 - 5 mL of an organic solvent, routinely 90 % acetone. But after such a great scientific effort, only a small proportion (less than 10 %) of the extract can be used for the analysis (due to the restrictions imposed by the injection process in liquid-chromatography), thus compromising the sensitivity of the result. This limitation has a special significance in the case of oligotrophic waters where the planktonic biomass is particularly reduced. It is well known that the addition of a salt into a mixture of water and a <b>water-miscible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>solvent</b> causes a separation of the solvent from the mixture and the formation of a two-phase system. We have employed this approach to concentrate pigment solutions previous to their HPLC analysis: concentrated saline solutions were added to acetonic extracts to generate a biphasic system in which pigments are transferred to the immiscible acetone upper phase in a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction process. Model pigment solutions were prepared, adjusting the concentration of 90 % acetone extracts of Chrysochromulina throndsenii to mimic extracts coming from the filtration of 2 L seawater with different total chlorophyll contents. In a typical concentration procedure, different volumes of saline solutions were added to 2. 5 mL of pigment extract in a screw cap glass tubes with polytetra-fluoroethylene (PTFE) lined cap. The mixture was shaken during 15 seconds by means of a vortex agitator and the two phases were allowed to separate at 25 ºC. After measuring its volume, an aliquot (130 uL) of the upper acetone phase was injected in the HPLC system. We studied the effect of different salts (magnesium chloride, magnesium acetate, ammonium acetate and ammonium formate), their concentrations and the volume ratio to acetonic extracts on the enrichment factor and the stability and recovery of the pigments. Both magnesium salts assayed were rejected as they promoted alteration products of different pigments. Magnesium chloride solutions produced a carotenoid derivative, probably generated from fucoxanthin, while magnesium acetate {{led to the formation of}} epimers of chlorophyll. No alteration product was detected with the ammonium salts assayed. The volume of immiscible acetone phase (and thus the enrichment factor) depended both on the concentration and the volume of saline solution added to the mixture. Final volumes of concentrated phase of about 400 uL (enrichment factors of 6. 25) were chosen due to difficulties in the handling of smaller volumes. The recoveries of different pigments varied depending on their chemical nature and the degree of enrichment of the extract. Carotenoids and non-polar chlorophylls were recovered above 85 % with 5 M saline solutions, while the recovery of acidic clorophylls (c 3 and c 2) decreased with enrichment factors...|$|E
