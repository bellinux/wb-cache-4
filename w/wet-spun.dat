Recent studies suggest that biomaterials incorporating silanol (SiOH) groups promote and maintain osteogenesis. The {{purpose of the present}} research work was to provide evidence that using wet-spinning technologies and a calcium silicate solution as a coagulation bath, it was possible to develop an in situ functionalization methodology to obtain 3 D <b>wet-spun</b> fibre meshes with SiOH groups, through a simple, economic and reliable process. SPCL (blend of starch with polycaprolactone) fibre meshes were produced by wet-spinning, using a calcium silicate solution as a non-solvent and functionalized in situ with SiOH groups. In vitro tests, using goat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs), showed that SPCL–Si scaffolds sustained cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, high ALP activity and matrix production indicated that SiOH groups improve cellular functionality towards the osteoblastic phenotype.

40|$|<b>Wet-spun</b> silk fibers have {{attracted}} the attention of many researchers because of 1) the unique properties of silk as a biomaterial, including good biocompatibility and cyto-compatability and 2) the various methods available to control the structure and properties of the fiber. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) have typically been used as a reinforcing material for natural and synthetic polymers. In this study, CNF-embedded silk fibroin (SF) nanocomposite fibers were prepared for the first time. The effects of CNF content on the rheology of the dope solution and the characteristics of <b>wet-spun</b> CNF/SF composite fibers were also examined. A 5 % SF formic acid solution that contained no CNFs showed nearly Newtonian fluid behavior, with slight shear thinning. However, after the addition of 1 % CNFs, the viscosity of the dope solution increased significantly, and apparent shear thinning was observed. The maximum draw ratio of the CNF/SF composite fibers decreased as the CNF content increased. Interestingly, the crystallinity index for the silk in the CNF/SF fibers was sequentially reduced as the CNF content was increased. This phenomenon {{may be due to the}} fact that the CNFs prevent b-sheet crystallization of the SF by elimination of formic acid from the dope solution during the coagulation process. The CNF/SF composite fibers displayed a relatively smooth surface with stripes, at low magnification (x 500). However, a rugged nanoscale surface was observed at high magnification (x 10, 000), and the surface roughness increased with the CNF content...|$|E

The microbubbles (with average diameter of 45 μm) had a high concentration of 3. 9 × 105 counts/mL at a gas flow rate of 0. 5 L/min. The gas holdup, total ozone mass-transfer coefficient, and average ozone utilization efficiency in the microbubble-ozonation were 6. 6, 2. 2, and 1. 5 times higher than those of the macrobubble-ozonation. Greater generation of hydroxyl radicals and a higher zeta potential of the bubbles were also observed in the microbubble ozonation process. The biodegradability of the wastewater was also significantly improved by microbubble-ozonation, which was ascribed to the enhanced degradation of alkanes, aromatic compounds, and the many other bio-refractory organic compounds in the wastewater.

In cooperation with the Dralon GmbH in Dormagen a CF precursor with properties at least equal to the industry reference fiber Bluestar was developed and used in fiber spinning experiments. For the improvement of the spinning process a hyperbranched, rheological additive was synthesized for the decrease of dynamic viscosity over a broad sheer rate range. The decreased dynamic viscosity would allow for a higher amount of polymer percentage in the spinning solution resulting in a higher density of the fiber and less usage of the solvent DMF.

Results of Raman spectroscopy indicate that the layer of PAN molecules are strongly attached onto the surface of CNT through grafting polymerization, leading to strong chemical bonding between CNTs and PAN matrix in the obtained fibers. In contrast, no obvious chemical interactions are observed between them in the fibers prepared by mechanically mixing. In both cases, the CNTs have significantly strengthened the PAN fibers.

The behavior of the double layer scaffold, functionalized with silanol groups (SPCL-Si) or without (SPCL), was assessed in a mandibular rodent model and compared to a commercial collagen membrane (positive control) and to empty defects (negative control). After 8 weeks of implantation, the micro-computed tomography and the histomorphometric analysis revealed that the SPCL-Si scaffolds induced significantly higher new bone formation compared to the collagen membrane and to the empty defects, although they had a similar performance when compared to the SPCL scaffolds.

40|$|Thermo-regulated polyacrylonitrilevinylidene {{chloride}} (PAN/VDC) {{fibers containing}} 4 - 40 wt. % of micro phase-change materials (microPCMs) were <b>wet-spun.</b> In this study, fibers containing less than 30 wt. % of microencapsulated n-octadecane were spun smoothly. The structures and {{properties of the}} fibers were investigated by using Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, dynamic mechanical analysis and thermogravimetric analysis, etc. The microcapsules were intact and evenly distributed inside the polymer matrix. The tensile strengths of the fibers with titers {{in the range of}} 1. 9 to 10. 9 dtex were 0. 7 to 2. 0 cN/dtex. The elongation of the fibers was approximately 7 %. The heat-absorbing and heat-evolving temperatures of the fibers increased slightly with the increase of the content of microPCMs. The enthalpy of melting or enthalpy of crystallization of the fiber containing 30 wt. % of microPCMs was approximately 30 J/g, and the enthalpy of melting or enthalpy of crystallization increased steadily as the content of microPCMs increased. The modulus of the fiber decreased with the increase in the amount of microPCMs in the fiber. The glass transition temperature of the fiber was 89 - 108 °C which decreased with the increase of the content of microPCMs, and the melting and decomposing temperatures of the fiber were approximately 190 and 220 °C, respectively. The fibers had a limited oxygen index value that was higher than 25 % and were permanently in flame retardation. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Fabrication and {{characterisation}} {{of conducting}} biomaterials in 3 -dimensional configuration for biomedical applications {{have been studied}} and is presented in this thesis. Different fibre spinning techniques (wet-spinning and electrospinning) were utilised to create multifunctional fibres to be employed for controlled drug delivery and cellular growth supports. Two different classes of organic conductors, namely conducting polymers and graphene, were utilised to induce and develop electrical and electrochemical features in the fibres for their potential applications in drug delivery and cell growth enhancement via electrical stimulation. Physical, mechanical, electrical, electrochemical and biological characterisations of the fibres were investigated. In chapter two, Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polypyrrole (Ppy) were utilised in conjugation with chitosan for fabrication of conducting biocompatible fibres using wet-spinning. Then, a layer of Ppy with an antibiotic drug Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro) as a dopant for Ppy was produced on the PEDOT:PSS-CHI fibres. The wet-spinning of PEDOT:PSS in a chitosan coagulation bath was successfully carried out and the fibres were shown to have an electrical conductivity of 56 ± 7 S/cm with a modulus and strength of 2. 0 ± 0. 3 GPa and 99 ± 7 MPa, respectively. The PEDOT:PSS-CHI fibres were subsequently employed as an electrode for the electropolymerisation of Ppy. Cipro on their surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the fibres showed the morphological differences between PEDOT:PSS and Ppy. Cipro layers, confirming the deposition of the Ppy. Cipro. Cyclic voltammograms of fibres exhibited that the Ppy. Cipro was electroactive and showed an oxidation and reduction peak at + 0. 2 V and - 0. 1 V, respectively. The conducting and electroactive fibres were utilised for controlling the release of Cipro using an electrochemical stimulation protocol. The results of electrical stimulation of fibres revealed that Cipro release could be tuned by utilizing the different redox states of PEDOT:PSS-CHI and Ppy. Cipro conducting polymers. The in vitro antibacterial studies on the fibres and released Cipro demonstrated that the drug did not lose its antibacterial property during electropolymerisation and electrochemically stimulated release processes. In vitro fluorescent staining images revealed that the fibres were not cytotoxic to B 35 neuroblastoma cells, however, the cells tended to cluster together rather than attach to the fibres. Moreover, {{the results of a}} lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test revealed that the Cipro concentrations released in this study did not have an adverse effect on B 35 neural cell. In chapter three, the development of a novel and facile system of wet-electrospinning (combined electrospinning and wet-spinning) is presented. This new method was developed in order to improve the attachment behaviour of B 35 neuroblastoma cells on <b>wet-spun</b> fibres containing conducting polymers. The process of fibre fabrication consists of simultaneously wet-spinning and electrospinning to form a structure composing of micro-size <b>wet-spun</b> fibres coated in nano-sized electrospun fibres. The new fibre configuration demonstrated increased B 35 neuroblastoma cell attachment as well as promising electrochemical property. Extended electrospinning times resulted in a thick coating of poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) around the PEDOT:PSS-CHIT fibres which hindered the electroactivity of this conducting inner core. This was attributed to the thick PLGA coating blocking any ions from solution interacting with the PEDOT:PSS. This result had implications on the ability to use these particular fibres in electrical stimulation experiments, and therefore shorter electrospinning times were investigated. Additionally, the release of Cipro from PLGA electrospun fibres has shown the potential of the fibres in drug delivery applications. In chapter four, fabrication and characterisation of graphene as an organic conductor in a <b>wet-spun</b> composite fibres structure was studied to induce and develop electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity in the fibres. The graphene dispersion exfoliated in N-Cyclohexyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (CHP) exhibited dispersion stability {{over an extended period of}} time. The free-standing graphene paper fabricated from the dispersion (thickness between 5. 0 to 100 μm) demonstrated well-defined layered morphology of graphene. The TEM characterisations of CHP-exfoliated graphene showed that the graphene dispersion consisted of monolayer and few layers of graphene. Additionally, the blend of PLGA with graphene was fabricated using a wet-spinning system. The rheological characterisation of wet-spinning solutions showed that a concentration of 1. 5 wt. % PLGA and above, dissolved in 5 mg/ml graphene dispersion in CHP, can provide viscosity of ≥ 0. 023 Pa s which was found to be spinnable. The wet-spinning of graphene with the biocompatible PLGA was carried out successfully with the fibres demonstrating an electrical conductivity of 1. 5 S/cm. The PLGA-graphene fibre showed electroactivity in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) when tested by cyclic voltammetry. The electrical conductivity measurements showed that, once the graphene content was greater than 11. 1 wt. % (with respect to PLGA), electrical conductivity increased above the percolation threshold (~ 30 S/m) and increased to 150 S/m when the graphene content was 24. 3 wt. %. The cytocompatibility tests and cryo-SEM images showed that C 2 C 12 myoblast cells were metabolically active on the fibres and attached along the length of the fibres. Furthermore, the proliferation assessment over 72 hr on the fibres revealed that C 2 C 12 cells proliferated along the fibres...|$|E
40|$|The ideal bone tissue-engineered (TE) {{construct}} {{remains to}} be found, although daily discoveries significantly contribute to improvements {{in the field and}} certainly have valuable long-term outcomes. In this work, different TE elements, aiming at bone TE applications, were assembled and its effect on the expression of several vas- cularization/angiogenesis mediators analyzed. Starch/polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds, obtained by two different methodologies, were combined with fibrin sealant (Baxter), human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), and growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] or fibroblast growth factor- 2 [FGF- 2]), and implanted in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR 2) -luc transgenic mice. The expression of VEGFR 2 along the implantation of the designed constructs was followed using a luminescence device (XenogenÒ) and after 2 weeks, the explants were retrieved to perform histological analysis and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction for vascularization (VEGF and VEGFR 1) and inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin- 4, and interferon-gamma) markers. It was showed that SPCL scaffolds ob- tained by wet spinning and by fiber bonding constitute an adequate support for hASCs. The assembled TE constructs composed by fibrin sealant, hASCs, VEGF, and FGF- 2 induce only a mild inflammatory reaction after 2 weeks of implantation. Additionally, the release of VEGF and FGF- 2 from the constructs enhanced the ex- pression of VEGFR 2 and other important mediators in neovascularization (VEGF and VEGFR 1). These results indicate the potential of VEGF or FGF- 2 within a bone TE construct composed by <b>wet-spun</b> SPCL, fibrin sealant, and hASCs in promoting the vascularization of newly formed tissue...|$|E
