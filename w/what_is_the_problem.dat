60|$|Let it {{be remembered}} that aged poverty {{is not the only}} evil with which, so far as our means allow, we have to grapple. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of the hour? It can be {{comprised}} in one word--Unemployment. After two years of unexampled trade expansion, we have entered upon a period of decline. We are not alone in this. A reaction from overtrading is general all over the world. Both Germany and the United States are suffering from a similar commercial contraction, and in both countries, in spite of their high and elaborate protective tariffs, a trade set-back has been accompanied by severe industrial dislocation and unemployment. In the United States of America, particularly, I am informed that unemployment has recently been more general than in this country. Indeed the financial collapse in the United States last autumn has been the most clearly marked of all the causes to which the present trade depression may be assigned.|$|E
