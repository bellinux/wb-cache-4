50|$|There are {{specific}} practices {{that must be}} followed to properly maintain the litter and maximize the health and productivity of the flocks raised on it. Many factors {{must be considered in}} successful litter management including time of the year, depth of the litter, floor space per bird, feeding practices, disease, the kind of floor, ventilation, <b>watering</b> <b>devices,</b> litter amendments, and even the potential fertilizer value of the litter after it is removed from the house. Most poultry are grown on dirt floors with some type of bedding material. Concrete floors and some specialized raised flooring are used at some facilities. In many areas of the United States, shavings from pine or other soft woods have historically been the bedding of choice for poultry production. Regionally, other materials have been the bedding material of choice due to regional cost and availability, such as rice hulls in the lower Mississippi River poultry production areas of Arkansas and Mississippi.|$|E

40|$|Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is {{responsible}} for mitigating the loss of wildlife habitat caused {{by the development of}} the Federal Columbia River Power System. BPA accomplishes this mitigation by funding projects consistent with those recommended by the Northwest Power Planning Council (Council). The projects are submitted to the Council from Indian Tribes, state agencies, property owners, private conservation groups, and other Federal agencies. Future wildlife mitigation actions with potential environmental impacts are expected to include land acquisition and management, water rights acquisition and management, habitat restoration and enhancement, installation of <b>watering</b> <b>devices,</b> riparian fencing, and similar wildlife conservation actions. BPA needs to ensure that individual wildlife mitigation projects are planned and managed with appropriate consistency across projects, jurisdictions, and ecosystems, as well as across time.

40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to safe drinking water. The maintenance of safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} {{investigating}} the drinking water quality of Iowa dairy cattle and the effect drinking water quality has on performance. There were 128 dairy farms participating in this study;For this study a novel method of sampling drinking water directly from drinking devices was utilized. There were 59 dairy farms using wells, 68 farms using rural water and 1 farm using spring water for the drinking water source. Contemporary production data was from DHIA records;The following parameters were measured, coliform, pH, total dissolved solids, nitrate, sulfate, and 22 minerals. A record of the type and amount of <b>watering</b> <b>devices</b> available for drinking water for lactating dairy cattle were taken. Linear inches available for drinking water space was determined {{as well as the}} frequency of cleaning of water devices;Preliminary results indicate that there are constituents of drinking water that appear to impact performance or reproduction of dairy cattle in Iowa. Elevated levels of nitrate, B, Ba, K, P and Mn in the drinking water {{have a negative effect on}} milk production. Elevated sulfate concentration in drinking water has a positive effect on milk production;Information about how drinking water was provided was also recorded. Positive effects on milk production were an increasing linear inches per cow available for drinking, the use of cups as drinking water devices and an increasing frequency of cleaning of water devices. An increasing distance from the feed bunk to the first available water device and not using drinking cup devices had a negative effect on milk production;Additional relationships of drinking water quality and the performance of Iowa dairy cattle are being delineated...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{describes}} rural poultry production systems in Morocco {{and the role}} of scavenging chicken in the rural household economy. An extensive survey was conducted aiming to characterize rural poultry farming {{in order to determine the}} main constraints to its development and suggest practical improvement means. One hundred and six households in 3 villages were surveyed with a total of 768 inhabitants. Each household owned on average 5. 8 hectares (from 0 to 11) and had 5 people. Women represented 49 % of the population. Rural poultry farming was essentially a women fs business: 73 % of the flocks were managed by women and represented their main activity in 58 % of the cases. Fifty four percent of the birds in the flocks were hatched on the farms while 46 % were purchased. Poultry represented the predominant species raised on the farms with flock size ranging from 0 to 58. Each household owned on average 11 chickens and/or 9 turkeys. The sex ratio was 4. 6 and 1. 7 females to a male for chickens and turkeys flocks respectively. The local birds, called Beldi were characterized by a wide genetic variability. Rudimentary housing was available for poultry in 79 % of the households (an increased ratio compared to 64 % in 1986 and 71 % in 1993). Local materials such as bamboo, wood, plastic screens and others were used. Rural poultry scavenged mainly around homes and some wheat bran, barley, wheat, maize, compound feed, dry bread and kitchen leftovers were distributed at various times. Rudimentary <b>watering</b> <b>devices</b> were available in 94 % of the farms with water supply coming from wells (61 %) or natural springs (49 %). Sexual maturity was reached at about 154 and 168 days for roosters and hens, and around 217 and 231 days for turkey toms and hens respectively. Sixty-nine days were observed on average between laying cycles. Hens sat on eggs 2 to 3 times a year and hatchability reached 78 % for chickens and 80 % for turkeys. Egg selection for incubation was based on henperformance, body size, egg size and colour and whether males were available in the flocks. The number of laying hens varied from 0 to 5 per farm. Eggs were laid all year around with a peak in spring (39 %) and summer (22 % of the households). The number of eggs produced per year was 78 per hen and 69 per turkey hen. High mortality was recorded as a result of diseases and predators (mortality rates reached up to 77 %). Local consumption (in 48 % of the households) and sales (52 %) were the main destinations of local poultry products. A rural household consumed on average 16 chickens and /or 11 turkeys per year. Sales of poultry products took place in ruralmarkets every week. This study revealed that archaic production techniques, rudimentary housing, anarchic crosses and diseases were the major constraints to the development of rural poultry production. Several improvement actions were proposed such as the extension of new production techniques, the distribution of rearing equipment, and others specially targeted for women. The current status and future outlook of rural poultry production are discussed. Future areas of interest for research and development are presented...|$|E
