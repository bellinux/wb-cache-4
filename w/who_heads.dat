In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), <b>who</b> <b>heads</b> to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E

25|$|Torrejón set {{to music}} most of Calderón's text, {{but not all}} of it.

In fact the scene is not necessary for the coherence of the plot, and the omission goes unnoticed by the common listener. Some modern performances (King, Garrido), nevertheless, recreated the cut scene, providing music for it.|$|E

25|$|According to a Hindu American Foundation report, {{the rights}} and {{religious}} freedom of Kashmiri Hindus have been severely curtailed since 1989, when there was an organised and systematic campaign by Islamist militants to cleanse Hindus from Kashmir.

Sanjay Tickoo, <b>who</b> <b>heads</b> the KPSS, an organisation which looks after Pandits who remain in the Valley, says the situation is complex. On one hand the community did face intimidation and violence {{but on the other}} hand he says there was no genocide or mass murder as suggested by Pandits who are based outside of Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|The series {{follows the}} daily {{interactions}} {{among the two}} groups. Il Palazzo would send the girls on their missions but the results are usually a failure with some explosive or catastrophic damage to the city. Kabapu would send the City Security workers on some equally ridiculous assignment which would also go wrong. Eventually Il Palazzo and Kabapu become aware of each other's manipulations and escalate their plans. Excel finds herself being replaced by a impersonator <b>who</b> <b>heads</b> the ILL Corporation. Massive amounts of money is spent on elections and politics. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.|$|E
25|$|After arrival on shore, males {{fast for}} three months, and females fast {{for five weeks}} during mating and when nursing their pups. The {{gestation}} period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression {{is more common in}} crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own. An orphaned pup may try to find another female to suckle and some are adopted, at least on Año Nuevo Island. Pups nurse about four weeks and are weaned abruptly before being abandoned by their mother, <b>who</b> <b>heads</b> out to sea within a few days. Left alone, weaned pups will gather into groups and stay on shore for 12 more weeks. The pups learn how to swim in the surf and eventually swim farther to forage. Thus, their first long journey at sea begins.|$|E
