40|$|Abstract: Under actual engine driving conditions, {{there is}} a {{possibility}} of engine valve and seat insert wear occurring as a result of various speed changes and accumulation of mileage. It is therefore necessary to examine the wear-related problems of engine valves and seat inserts and to determine by comparison whether speed or mileage inflicts the greater wear. This work focuses on the various degrees of wear produced at three different singular test speeds (10 Hz, 25 Hz, and multi-Hz) and two different cycle numbers (2. 1 × 106 and 6. 0 × 106). Throughout all tests performed in this study, the temperature of the outer surface of the seat insert was controlled at 350 °C and the test load was 1960 N. <b>Wear</b> <b>depths</b> were measured using a confocal laser microscope, and wear mechanisms were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The extent of wear produced at higher speeds (25 Hz) was found to be greater than that produced at lower speeds (10 Hz) under identical test conditions (temperature, valve displace-ment, cycle number, and test load). Although test cycle numbers were increased by a factor of 3, for example from 2. 1 × 106 to 6. 0 × 106, the <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> were not proportionally increased.

Mechanical properties, namely hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E), were assessed by nanoindentation technique. The coated samples presented lower H and E values than the Z 250 composite resin substrate. Such measurements were used to calculate H/E ratios. Wear tests were carried out in water by using a pin-on-plate apparatus. Scars formed on the samples were qualitatively examined by optical microscopy, while their <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> were measured by contact profilometry. Based on the findings, an empirical correlation between the <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> and H/E was obtained. A high H/E ratio was associated to surfaces with enhanced wear resistance.

40|$|Abstract. The {{friction}} and wear behaviors of PTFE composites filled with irregular or spherical copper powders were experimentally investigated. The effects of shape, content {{and size of}} the copper powders on the tribological properties of the PTFE composites were discussed. The results showed that the friction coefficients of the PTFE composites filled with irregular copper powders are higher than that of pure PTFE. While the friction coefficients of the PTFE composites filled with spherical copper powders were almost always lower than that of pure PTFE. Both irregular and spherical copper powders can effectively decrease the wear of the composites. The wear of the composites filled with spherical copper powders will gradually decrease with the increase of the content of copper. But the effect of the content of irregular copper powder on the wear of the composites was not so obvious. The friction coefficients and <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> of the composites increase with the decrease of the Cu size. The increase amplitudes in friction coefficients and <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> of the spherical Cu filled composites are smaller than those of the irregular Cu filled composites...|$|R

In hot extrusion process, finite-element method (FEM), BP neural network and genetic algorithm were combined together to optimize extrusion die profile which yielded more uniform <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> distribution on die profile.

The specimens of oil ring were rubbed against cast iron engine cylinder liner under boundary lubrication conditions. The ring and liner surfaces were examined by optical, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The elemental analysis of surfaces was performed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Surface observations showed that coating was removed from the ring surface. Higher levels of Ca, Zn, P, and S elemental ratios (0. 93 %, 0. 45 %, 1. 55 %, and 1. 60 % as atomic percent) were detected on the cylinder liner surface. Wear width, length, and depth measurements were performed by optical and atomic force microscopies on the ring and cylinder liner surface.

30|$|Intermediate casings in the build {{sections}} {{are subject}} to severe wear in extended-reach drilling. This paper presents a new method for predicting the <b>depth</b> of a <b>wear</b> groove on the intermediate casing. According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation of casing wear by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the <b>wear</b> groove <b>depth</b> and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} casing wear groove is crescent-shaped. The change of casing <b>wear</b> groove <b>depth</b> versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting casing wear location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The casing <b>wear</b> groove <b>depth</b> of a planned well is predicted with inversion of the casing wear factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting casing wear in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on casing wear should be taken into account in casing wear prediction.|$|R
40|$|Wear {{in forming}} tools and contact {{problems}} between sheet-metal and tool-material are common problems in manufacturing industries and sheet-metal-parts production. In this paper recent tool material experiences are presented. Quantitative determination of wear has been performed using micro hardness indentions {{made on the}} tool surface prior to pressings and thereafter measured. Wear tests are performed with both model tools in a wear test press and in one case study. It is shown in this paper that: VANCRON shows equally good anti-galling properties as VANADIS 4 with TICRON treatment in model tools. VANCRON was successfully used in a production tool (case study) for 1, 000, 000 pressings without galling problems. The wear is small and production can continue further. VANADIS 4 with TICRON treatment in the same application is recoated before 1, 000, 000 parts. The method of using micro hardness indentions {{appears to be a}} promising way to quantitatively determine <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> on tool surfaces. The studied <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> are of magnitude 0 - 10 μm and the precision of the method is estimated to ± 0. 05 μm. It is possible to follow the wear already in an early stage with the method of using micro hardness indentions both in model tools and in production tools. It is complex to measure wear with a test method outside the actual pressing operation {{and it is difficult to}} compare the results from different test methods due to the differences in how the wear is achieved. The method with special Wear Test Press WTP is a method with result very close to the wear appearing in an actual pressing operation of heat exchanger plates.

The formulae remove previous limiting approximations made in the literature and extend to the prediction of the <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> of both contacting surfaces. The wear model accords with a previous model that is validated by pin-on-disc testing of a steel/steel contact. The current paper uses the formulae derived to predict the <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> of a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating and a steel ball as they slide against each other in deionised water. An Archard equation is used to predict the wear volume of each surface; however, a DLC coating is known to form a transfer layer which reduces the rate of wear, and since this scenario does not obey Archard’s law directly, a time-dependent-specific wear rate is used to fit a semi-empirical model to experimental results.

According to the test data and the linear wear model based on the energy dissipation proposed by White and Dawson, the tool joint–casing wear coefficient was obtained. The finite element model for casing wear mechanism research was established using ABAQUS. The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the <b>wear</b> <b>depth,</b> exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the casing wear process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the maximum casing <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> with time was obtained. Besides, the relationship between the maximum <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> and remaining collapse strength was established to predict the maximum <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> and the remaining strength of the casing after a period of accumulative wear, providing a theoretical basis for the safety assessment of worn casing...|$|E

The specific permanent defects governing the wear phenomena are composed of stair-rod dislocations and prismatic dislocation loops as well as vacancies. While the contact pressure for the nucleation of initial dislocation is independent on probe radius, the minimum <b>wear</b> <b>depth</b> increases with probe radius. Further analysis of the shear strain distribution implies that a larger probe results in more compliant deformation of the material, which leads to larger volume of wear debris and wider extent of defect structures.|$|E

40|$|A costly effect, {{caused by}} the {{relative}} motion of machine components in contact, is wear. Solid surfaces come into contact when the lubricant film thickness is thin, resulting in locally high pressures and high wear rates. Components and machines will, due to this wear, eventually lose their functionality. Machines are often lubricated, meaning {{that there is a}} sharing of load between lubricant and asperities in the interfaces between machine components. The roughness of the surfaces influences the likelihood that asperities collide. When asperities collide, protective layers grow on the solid surfaces due to chemical constituents of lubricants. These chemical constituents are called additives and some additives can, under boundary lubrication conditions, interact with surfaces to form the protective layers, also called tribofilms. The formed layers and the formation of layers have previously been studied separately. Numerical simulations are often used to model phenomena such as wear. In this thesis it is asked whether it is possible to model wear on different length and time scales, and to model the interplay between these length and time scales? Can we model the chemical effects on the nano scale, in combination with contact mechanical effects due to roughness on the micro scale? Can we learn something from numerical simulation of the small changes in roughness during a wear process of a mixed lubrication contact in a component?Several numerical simulation methods have been used. Contact mechanics problems are treated through the boundary element method. A model based on Arrhenius equation is used to include chemical effects in a chemo-mechanical simulation of the growth of tribofilm. An equation for the lubricant film thickness is combined with contact mechanical behaviour to estimate load sharing. A method to include the effect of wear on the load sharing is included in the model. Archards wear equation is used to simulate wear at several length scales. A model to determine the load distribution between gears in an orbital type hydraulic motor is developed. Three wear test rigs are utilized. An orbital type hydraulic motor test rig is used to validate wear models for the gear set. A ring-on-ring test is used to experimentally simulate steady state conditions of wear on the topography scale. A sliding reciprocating ball-on-disk test rig is used to evaluate the wear in a contact. Topography measurements and microscopy are used to quantify and qualitatively locate wear. The methods for topography measurements are stylus profilometry, vertical scanning interferometry and atomic force microscopy. The microscopy techniques which are used to locate and classify wear scars, are confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Numerical simulation results are compared with measurements of the wear in a reciprocating ball on disk rig. Wear on the nano-meter scale on a rough surface is simulated by means of numerical methods, and <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> from the numerical simulations are compared with <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> measured by Atomic Force Microscopy. A model for tribofilm growth due to chemical reactions on the nano-scale is applied to model a wear process on a surface topography. Wear is numerically investigated in a gear set in an hydraulic motor and the results are compared with results from experimental investigations. A two scale model is applied to the gear set, in which wear effects the geometry of the gears and the small scale surface topography. In Paper A, ball on disk wear is simulated numerically and by experimental methods. In Paper B, dry contact wear on the topography scale is considered. Roughness features on the scale of 100 nm, were similarly worn in experiment and simulation. In Paper C, a tribochemistry model is constructed in order to evaluate the growth of tribofilms on rough surfaces. The numerical model exhibits similar behaviour as other authors have observed when conducting experiments involving lubricant additives. A multi scale wear model is applied to study wear in hydraulic motors in Paper D-F. The measured <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> agree well with the <b>wear</b> <b>depths</b> predicted by numerical simulation. The location {{of the majority of the}} wear is the same in the numerical simulations and the experiments. Refinements of the methods to determine force distribution as well as the influence of roughness, improves the predictive capabilities of the multiscale wear models. Further improvements of multi scale wear modelling are suggested, and some interesting future research topics are suggested.

Some equipment, however, cannot be measured by inspection cars, so that is measured or just visually checked and manually measured only about once a year.

Furthermore, some items such as temperature of compression joints of feeders and displacement of springs of STBs constantly vary according to load current and weather.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of accurate and correct feature parameters, which describe the useful cutting {{life of a}} milling cutter, is important for remote process monitoring. The main parameters extracted and analysed are the highest and the average flank length of the <b>wear</b> land <b>depth</b> {{as well as the}} area within the wear land. The problems with the internet speed and bandwidth are overcome by only uploading specific wear-land features the resulting file size is adequate for internet monitoring. This paper outlines a methodology for automatically extracting useful direct tool-wear parameters remotely via the internet for tool wear decision-making...|$|R
