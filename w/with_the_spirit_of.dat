5|$|Peking-opera {{performers}} use {{four main}} skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, {{and all other}} types of dance. The final skill is combat, which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills {{are expected to be}} performed effortlessly, in keeping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the art form.|$|E
5|$|By 1921, Tzara {{had become}} {{involved}} in conflicts with other figures in the movement, whom he claimed had parted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Dada. He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between Breton and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when Breton first made known his wish {{to do away with}} musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-450s the Athenians {{launched}} an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, {{which led to}} a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to Cyprus. Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Cimon's policy.|$|E

5|$|A portal {{is created}} at Cloud Ruler Temple and the player is sent through to Mankar Camoran's created realm of Paradise. After {{bypassing}} Daedra, Mythic Dawn members and obstacles, the player confronts Camoran and kills him. The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E

25|$|There {{could be}} a freeman <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the slave, and there {{could be a}} slave with a spirit full of freedom; whoever is {{faithful}} to himself – he is a freeman, and whoever fills his life only with what is good and beautiful in the eyes of others – he is a slave.|$|E
25|$|Thus, - {{according}} to Zaehner - while {{the direction that}} the Sassanids took was not altogether at odds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Gathas, the extreme dualism that accompanied a divinity that was remote and inaccessible made the faith less than attractive. Zurvanism was then truly heretical only {{in the sense that}} it weakened the appeal of Zoroastrianism.|$|E
25|$|The reactionary and feudalistic {{thought in}} Müller's writings, which agreed so little <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the times, {{prevented}} his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character {{prevented them from}} being justly appreciated. However, Müller's teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of corporatism and the corporate state, for example Othmar Spann (Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen über Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft, Vienna, 1921).|$|E
50|$|Henrik Gustaf Ulfvenklou (1756-28 September 1819), was a Swedish mystic {{and medium}} who gained a great {{influence}} in the circles of Charles XIII of Sweden by claiming to communicate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|R

25|$|All {{appointments}} of clerics had to {{be approved}} by the state. Herewith, training and appointment of the clergy came under state supervision. The traditional regimen of clerical study was {{to be replaced by a}} modern education in a liberal German institution, thus ensuring that candidates to the priesthood were imbued <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> secularism. Furthermore, ecclesiastical offices could only be filled with the permission of the highest civil authority in each province, essentially reviving the ancient practice of lay investiture.|$|E
25|$|Stewart and Mann also {{collaborated on}} other films outside the western genre. The Glenn Miller Story (1954) was {{critically}} acclaimed, garnering Stewart a BAFTA Award nomination, and (together <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> St. Louis) continued Stewart's portrayals of 'American heroes'. Thunder Bay, released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations {{to a more}} contemporary setting, with Stewart as a Louisiana oil driller facing corruption. Strategic Air Command, released in 1955, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.|$|E
25|$|Tipu is {{considered}} to be anti-Christian by several historians. While Alan Machado in his book 'Slaves of Sultans', argues that by expelling Christian priests, Tipu was only following precedent set by European rivals. Historian J. B. Prashant More in his paper 'Tipu Sultan and the Christians' argues that Tipu's encounters and dealings with the Christians of both European and Indian origin were in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> his times and also had a political dimension. The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in their history.|$|E

25|$|When Mai Chaza recovered, she {{was hailed}} as having {{returned}} from the dead. She announced {{that she had been}} instructed by God to become a faith healer, live a celibate life, and heal the sick, especially barren women. She also claimed to have been reconciled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> her dead sister-in-law. She began working as a n'anga, a traditional healer, telling people the causes of their illnesses in exchange for a payment of two shillings and sixpence. The Methodist hierarchy ordered her to stop and refused her request to have her own preaching circuit. She responded by establishing her own unauthorised circuit.|$|E
25|$|In Book 6, Aeneas, {{with the}} {{guidance}} of the Cumaean Sibyl, descends into the underworld through an opening at Cumae. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river Acheron and are ferried across by Charon before passing by Cerberus. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in Tartarus and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He is then brought to green fields of Elysium. There he speaks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.|$|E
25|$|The Rising Sun badge, {{also known}} as the General Service Badge or the Australian Army Badge, is the {{official}} insignia of the Australian Army and is mostly worn on the brim of a slouch hat or, less frequently, on the front of a peaked cap for Army personnel filling certain ceremonial appointments. The badge is readily identified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> ANZAC, the legend of the Australian soldier (or digger), and the esprit de corps of the Army itself, due to its association with the landings at Gallipoli in 1915. Today, new recruits receive the badge with their initial issue of equipment, which happens within their first three days of enlistment.|$|E
