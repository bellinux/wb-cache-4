5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Slap-Happy were {{recorded}} before the band decided to form Wax Tadpole. Sparks and Gardner wrote all the songs, usually at Gardner's home, even though the whole group contributed to the album {{in one form or}} another. Unlike its predecessor, Slap-Happy was made with a low budget. According to Sparks, [...] "We utilized a lot of home studios, did a lot of our tracking ourselves, used a lot of first takes. I think there's a lot of life in this record, and yet I think when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own label we were fearing having to take a major step down in production because of the financial aspects." [...] The album was produced by Brian Haught, a friend of the band who let the band use his studio [...] "just out of the kindness of his heart." [...] It was recorded and mixed at Synical Labs, PCS Studios, Sound City, de Prume Studios, Sonors Studios, and King Sound and Pictures in Los Angeles. Audio mastering took place at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles.|$|E

He sent the hounds down below the rim with George; and taking R.C. and me, and Lee and Nielsen, he led us over to what he called Horton Thicket. Never would I forget my first sight of that immense forest-choked canyon. It was a great cove running up from the basin into the rim. Craggy ledges, broken, ruined, tottering and gray, slanted down into this abyss. The place was so vast that these ledges appeared far apart, yet they were many. An empire of splintered cliff! ...|$|E
60|$|Strange to relate, it was {{not till}} my Viking, with a rueful face, {{reminded}} me of the fact, that I bethought me of a circumstance somewhat alarming at the first blush. We must push off without chart or quadrant; though, as will shortly be seen, a compass was by no means out of the question. The chart, to be sure, I did not so much lay to heart; but a quadrant was more than desirable. Still, it was by no means indispensable. For this reason. When <b>we</b> <b>started,</b> <b>our</b> latitude would be exactly known; and whether, on our voyage westward, we drifted north or south therefrom, we could not, by any possibility, get so far out of our reckoning, as to fail in striking some one of a long chain of islands, which, for many degrees, {{on both sides of the}} equator, stretched right across our track.|$|E

The next day we sent them out again, this time to sell bread. We have been selling bread ever since.” ...|$|E
50|$|Located on {{the south}} side of Tucson, Pueblo was the first new high school to be built in Tucson School District 1. Preparations for the {{eventual}} transition from Tucson High and Roskruge had begun the previous year. Principal Brooks recalled, “Even though we weren’t down at Pueblo, <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> athletic programs, clubs were organized, homerooms and counselors were identified for students and lunch periods for students were assigned.” In essence, even before it opened its doors students were invited to be a part of the Pueblo community.|$|E
50|$|There are 15 {{planets in}} our {{universe}} which contain human life. <b>We</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> divine cycle on the Moon and, via six other planets, arrived on Mars. Then again, via six other planets, we finally arrived on Earth. Each of these planets pushed {{the development of}} the human body a bit further. For example, on the Moon, we reached only a fishlike phase but on Mars, we were already like an ape. This means that there are no other planets in our universe which contain human life which is as developed as on Earth.|$|E

Our first rejection letter came from a festival that I really wanted to be a part of and thus <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> film festival application process with a small chip on the shoulder and a little bit of a wounded heart. So it goes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reliance Steel {{also wanted}} to {{strengthen}} its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975. Gimbel told Metal Service News, [...] "We had spent probably two years trying to buy out somebody, {{but at the time}} there was a big boom there, and everyone felt the streets of Houston were paved with gold. We just could never make a deal to buy someone. So <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own company." [...] Reliance closed the Houston center in 1984 due to a slump in the oil industry.|$|E

5000|$|Between 1986 and 1991, {{while there}} was violent turmoil and {{struggle}} for independence from the Soviet Union in the other Baltic states, Estonians courageously and peacefully demanded that the Soviets recognize their country’s right to statehood and self-governance. The revolutionary songs they created anchored Estonia’s struggle for freedom, which was ultimately accomplished in 1991 without {{the loss of a}} single life. The Estonian activist Heinz Valk, who first dubbed Estonia's resistance the [...] "Singing Revolution", said proudly of his countrymen, [...] "Until now, revolutions have been filled with destruction, burning, killing, and hate, but <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> revolution with a smile and a song."

The cd and single are being put out (in Japan only, at least for now) by the brilliant Japanese label Airmail, the same folks who re released the Pez back catalog 7 years ago (that issue was promptly sold out).Performing in Japan has been something we have wanted to do ever since <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>our</b> noisy rock combo in 1971.
