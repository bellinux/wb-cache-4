5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Health care {{providers}} are often {{unfamiliar with the}} needs of women <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Moreover maternity <b>and</b> postnatal services may not be specifically tailored to the needs of women <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their families. We conducted a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of healthcare interventions to improve outcomes for pregnant <b>and</b> postnatal women <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> for their families. METHODS: Studies on pregnant <b>and</b> postnatal women <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their families which evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention using a design that met the criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care group were eligible for inclusion in this review. A comprehensive search strategy was carried using eleven electronic databases. No restriction on date or language was applied. Included studies were assessed for quality and their results summarized and tabulated. RESULTS: Only three studies fully met the inclusion criteria. All were published after 1990, and conducted as small single-centre randomized controlled trials. The studies were heterogeneous and not comparable. Therefore the main finding of this review was the lack of published research on the effectiveness of healthcare interventions to improve outcomes for pregnant women <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their families. CONCLUSIONS: More research is required to evaluate healthcare interventions to improve outcomes for pregnant women <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their families...|$|R

5|$|The site of CenturyLink Field is the {{smallest}} of those developed for new NFL stadiums. The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and {{the placement of the}} lower sections closer to the field, this provided a better view of the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000-seat capacity. Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 club seats. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> their companions located in various sections. In 2009 CenturyLink Field ranked 21st out of the 31stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.|$|E
5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act became law, and it {{provided}} comprehensive civil rights protection {{for people with}} disabilities. Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make “reasonable accommodations” for workers <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> not discriminate against otherwise qualified workers <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> that public accommodations such as restaurants and stores not discriminate against people <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> that they make “reasonable modifications” to ensure access for disabled members of the public.

40|$|The {{world of}} {{disability}} is often neglected or {{taken for granted}} in able-bodied society. Apart from the challenge that disability is a social construct (Linton, 1998, 2006; Longmore, 2003; Thompson, 1997) there is {{an impact on the}} people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> that they either feel left out or they don’t belong in the larger community. The able-bodied community is also left with very little knowledge or no sensitivity towards people <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> These internal whirlpools do not contribute to any community only to create larger gaps and higher differences between the groups of people. Peace (2010) claims that disability is something imposed on to a person on top of a physical impairment. Nord (2008) advocates that while environmental barriers and social attitudes are crucial aspects of a person’s experience, they can indeed disable a person. The study reported high-lights what is home for people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their family members. The way the person <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> family members without disability share the same home and nurture personal relationships with each other demands greater attention. This research sheds light on the intricate relationships that exists between the family members including person <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their built environment. These existential connections provide a holistic viewpoint and the glimpse into the lived experiences of homes for people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their care-givers. Concepts of universal design or barrier free design have not been successful (Connell and Sanford, 1999) in revealing in-depth the nature of place-making for people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their care-givers. Such studies fail to incorporate the holistic needs of individuals <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their family members in terms of their bodily, visceral, emotional, social, psycho-social, intuitive, spiritual and temporal needs, to name a few (Franz, Bitner, 2010). This paper reports on some preliminary findings on phenomena of dwelling for people with different kinds of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their care-givers sharing the same home from an interior design perspective...|$|R
