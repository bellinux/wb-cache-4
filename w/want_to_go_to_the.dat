5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
500|$|The first {{inquiries}} of {{the police}} by Bruno Contrada and Boris Giuliano instead focused on the lead of De Mauro’s investigations into the death of Mattei, prompted by the disappearance a few pages of notes and a tape with the last speech given by Mattei from De Mauro’s office. The investigations were seriously hampered due to deviations by people within the Italian police forces and secret services. According to police inspector Boris Giuliano there was [...] "someone at the ministry in Rome that does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom {{of the death of}} De Mauro." [...] According to Giuliano an order to scale down the investigation was issued by the head of the secret service, Vito Miceli, allegedly involved in the Borghese coup. Miceli had been in contact with the mafiosi Giuseppe Calderone and Giuseppe Di Cristina who wanted to support the coup, scheduled for December 1970.|$|E

[...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I {{need to give}} you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.' [...] I {{have a lot of respect}} for him now because he saw that. It was a move that had to be made for me to be able to continue playing baseball. I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Initial first-run {{pressings}} of {{the international}} version of the Come On Over album during March 1998 featured White on the song, while subsequent pressings began featuring the song as a solo recording. [...] In early 1998, Mercury executives were informed that White {{would be unable to}} promote the song alongside Twain; therefore, Twain had to return to the studio to re-record White's parts on her own. According to White's spokesman at Asylum Records, [...] "We've certainly heard knocking on our door about [...] "From This Moment On" [...] being too contemporary for Bryan's sake; therefore, it is fine if they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Top 40 without him." [...] White later claimed that he had no hard feelings towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song, stating, [...] "They're releasing this song as a pop record, and I'm not a pop artist, so my feelings aren't hurt." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Ravager ship the Eclector was handled by Weta Digital. Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta also needed to create a digital double for David Hasselhoff for the moment when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff's guise. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We tried morphing to a live action Hoff – {{but it did not}} hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly to the body… so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt." [...] Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego's planet, known as the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the fractal art of Hal Tenny, who Gunn hired to help design Ego's environment. Gunn added that there are [...] "over a trillion polygons on Ego's planet," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest visual effect of all time. There's nothing even close to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1960 Stevenson {{announced}} that he would not seek a third Democratic presidential nomination, but would accept a draft. One of his closest friends told a journalist that [...] "Deep down, he wants [...] But he wants the [...] Convention to come to him, he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Convention." [...] In May 1960 Senator John F. Kennedy, who was actively campaigning for the Democratic nomination, visited Stevenson at his Libertyville home. Kennedy asked Stevenson for a public endorsement of his candidacy; in exchange Kennedy promised, if elected, to appoint Stevenson as his Secretary of State. Stevenson turned down the offer, which strained relations between the two men. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Stevenson's admirers, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, Agnes Meyer, and such Hollywood celebrities as Dore Schary and Henry Fonda, vigorously promoted him for the nomination, even though he was not an announced candidate. JFK's campaign manager, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, reportedly threatened Stevenson in a meeting, telling him that unless he agreed to place his brother's name in nomination [...] "you are through." [...] Stevenson refused and ordered him out of his hotel room. In letters to friends, Stevenson described both John and Robert Kennedy as [...] "cold and ruthless", referred to Robert Kennedy as the [...] "Black Prince", and expressed his belief that JFK, [...] "though bright and able, was too young, too unseasoned, to be President; he pushed too hard, was in too much of a hurry; he lacked the wisdom of humility... that both Kennedy and the nation would benefit from a postponement of his ambition." ...|$|E
