25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She actually went in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E
500|$|Shiina is {{a female}} ninja who fights with dual-wielding kodachi and shuriken. She {{is able to}} sense when danger is coming and is a highly capable fighter. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a {{weakness}} for cute things like stuffed animals. She is strict in her training and is very self-critical when she fails, especially to a newcomer like Otonashi. She decides that her weakness is having little concentration. She is shown balancing a broom and other objects <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> for long amounts of time. She rarely speaks but will normally remark [...] "how shallow-minded" [...] or [...] "how foolish" [...] ("this is so stupid" [...] in the English dub) whenever the obvious or something stupid is said. As {{she did not have}} a name when she arrived in the afterlife, Yuri named her Shiina after her callsign, 'C7' (Shi-nana).|$|E
2500|$|A self-taught left-handed guitarist, Cotten {{developed}} her own original style. She {{played a}} guitar strung for a right-handed player, but played it upside down, {{as she was}} left-handed. This position required her to play the bass lines <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> and the melody with her thumb. Her signature alternating bass style {{has become known as}} [...] "Cotten picking".|$|E
5000|$|... "She beckoned to him <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> {{like one}} {{preparing}} a certificate in pianoforte...at the Leinster School of Music." [...] (Samuel Beckett) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I remember,' she said, still laughing, 'at Knockholt--you--a half-grown lamb--a dog--in procession.' She {{marked the}} {{position}} of the three <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
60|$|She pointed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> {{to where}} the waves were {{breaking}} in a thin line of white, about fifty yards from the beach.|$|R
2500|$|Genie's {{gross motor}} skills were {{extremely}} weak; she could neither {{stand up straight}} nor fully straighten any of her limbs, and had very little endurance. Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic [...] "bunny walk", in which she held her {{hands in front of}} her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with sensory processing and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately the level of a two-year-old. She could not chew and had very severe dysphagia, totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> She was also completely incontinent, and did not respond to extreme temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|On September 22, 1827, Joseph and Emma took a {{horse and}} {{carriage}} belonging to Joseph Knight, Sr., {{and went to a}} hill now known as the Hill Cumorah where Joseph said he received a set of golden plates. This created a great deal of excitement in the area. In December 1827, the couple decided to move to Harmony, where they reconciled—to some extent—with Isaac and Elizabeth Hale. Emma's parents helped her and Joseph obtain a house and a small farm. Once they settled in, Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon with Emma acting as a scribe. She became a physical witness of the plates, reporting that she felt them through a cloth, traced the pages through the cloth <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> heard the metallic sound they made as she moved them, and felt their weight. She later wrote in an interview with her son, Joseph Smith III: [...] "In writing for your father I frequently wrote day after day, often sitting at the table close by him, he sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us." [...] In Harmony on June 15, 1828, Emma gave birth to her first child—a son named Alvin—who lived only a few hours.|$|E
60|$|And thereupon she {{proceeded}} to rub the lather in <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned over}} the dial's face, and began to draw the Latin numerals <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b> So arch, withal, that I forgot my ill-humour.|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{lifted her}} dark {{head from the}} {{shoulder}} of the captain on which it lay and pointed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> at the Jew, Simeon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sarah, I {{told you}} not," [...] said Mary, looking very stern and hesitating <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> whether or no {{she would take}} the letter.|$|R
60|$|Anna drummed impatiently <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> {{against the}} arm of her chair.|$|E
60|$|She tapped <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> {{upon the}} little table by their side.|$|E
60|$|Preserving her unmoved countenance, and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> still going, Estella {{shook her}} head.|$|E
6000|$|CLARE sits tracing {{a pattern}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> on the cloth, her [...] eyes lowered. Once she raises them, and follows ARNAUD's dark [...] rapid figure.|$|R
60|$|Her father sat laughing; <b>her</b> mother <b>with</b> {{distress}} in <b>her</b> eyes, {{looked at her}} daughter, who hung her head and made patterns on the table-cloth <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
60|$|She took no {{immediate}} {{account of his}} words. Her eyes were fixed upon one spot in that distant curtain of sky. Suddenly she pointed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> still {{tightened}} {{over the}} door-catch {{she turned and}} looked at him.|$|E
60|$|The other {{pulled off}} her glove and touched the girl's cheek <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Looking at me {{perfectly}} unmoved and <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> busy, {{she shook}} her head again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precious Sir Galahad," [...] {{she said}} in a mock caressing voice, and {{stroking}} his cheek <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> [...] "You ought to have been a monk—a martyr, a Carthusian." ...|$|R
60|$|Alice {{opens the}} door, and sees Amy {{standing}} there <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> to <b>her</b> lips, {{just as they}} stood in all the five plays. Ginevra could not have posed her better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! 'tis {{you that}} {{really need the}} holiday," [...] said Carey, wistfully; [...] "much {{more than any of}} us. Look at this great crow's foot," [...] tracing it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louise {{clasped her}} knees <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> and sat thinking. She was wide awake now.|$|E
60|$|She {{touched his}} outstretched hand <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> and then fearing lest he should change his mind, {{promptly}} rang the bell.|$|E
60|$|Glancing behind her, Lysbeth saw the {{creature}} nip her nostrils <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{as though to}} shut out an evil smell.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's you," [...] whispered Jack, {{throwing}} the white carnation at Jill, and she threw back the red one, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> on <b>her</b> lips, for the tale {{was very interesting}} now.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush!' she said, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> on <b>her</b> lips. 'His {{eyes are}} closing. He'll be {{conscious}} when he next opens them. Shall I {{give you a}} leading word to say to him?' ...|$|R
60|$|Brand {{felt his}} heart beating with more than the mere {{excitement}} of the moment. He yielded. She pressed a spring <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> and the panel rolled slowly back into its place.|$|R
60|$|She strummed {{upon the}} table <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> Her whole body {{seemed to be}} moving to the music. She nodded several times.|$|E
60|$|She turns {{quickly and}} sees the rector. She instinctively {{switches}} at her Gozzoli fringe <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> but gives it up as hopeless.|$|E
60|$|Then one day, {{when she}} was alone, the {{mistress}} came near to her, and touching her cheek <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> said with some difficulty.|$|E
6000|$|She put her {{arm over}} his shoulder, and touched the plaster on his neck gently <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger.</b> [...] "There's one thing I don't doubt," [...] she said: [...] "the Captain did that!" ...|$|R
60|$|She searched me out <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eyes, smiled, {{touching}} the pearls <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> and {{passed on to}} her place next to the daughters of Peroa, {{at one end of}} the head table which was shaped like a horse's hoof.|$|R
60|$|We {{all three}} stood {{and looked at}} one another for a moment, Milly Hart <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> still {{pointing}} to the vacant place where the photograph had been. Then Cecil broke into a short laugh.|$|R
