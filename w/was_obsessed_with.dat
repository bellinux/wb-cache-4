5|$|Before Ratajkowski left London {{at the age}} of five, she <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> theater. She began {{acting as}} a child, staging shows for her family. Ratajkowski's first formal role was as Elsa in an {{adaptation}} of The Little Match Girl at the North Coast Repertory Theatre School in Solana Beach, California. Later, in 2004, she played Harriet in the interactive Lyceum Theatre production of Harriet Potter and the Throne of Applewort. Ratajkowski grew up without television; she tried soccer, acting, and ballet before modeling.|$|E
5|$|Hess <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> {{his health}} {{to the point}} of hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez {{was born}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent {{thirteen}} years living there. As a child, Ramirez <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers {{to be one of}} his most prized possessions. In 1985, he moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He would often play ball at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E

Mu'tazilis <b>were</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> Divine justice, whereas the Ash'aris <b>were</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> Divine omnipotence. Nevertheless, Divine self-restraint in Mu'tazili discourse is because of, not a negation of, Divine omnipotence.|$|R

25|$|Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa {{had invited}} a {{selection}} of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition {{that was to be}} incorporated within the roof. The architects included Moshe Safdie, Yona Friedman, Hans Hollein and Giancarlo De Carlo.

The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free ball joint to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using jacks.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
25|$|In late 222, Cao Pi {{ordered his}} general Cao Xiu {{to lead the}} Wei armies to attack Dongkou County. In {{response}} to the invasion, Xu Sheng, along with Lü Fan and Quan Cong led Sun Quan's forces across the river to defend Dongkou. However, they encountered a storm {{and many of their}} troops and ships were lost. Sun Quan's generals were browbeaten because they had lost about half of their ships in the storm, but were overjoyed when they heard of the arrival of He Qi, who reached Dongkou behind schedule and was not affected by the disaster. Coincidentally, He Qi <b>was</b> <b>obsessed</b> <b>with</b> luxuries so his ships were finely decorated and his weapons were of top quality. Cao Xiu was shocked when he witnessed the grandeur display of He Qi's refulgent navy so he paused the attack and withdrew. Xu Sheng managed to gather his surviving troops and form a defence line along the shore. A naval battle ensued, during which Cao Xiu targeted Lü Fan while sending his subordinates to attack Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng was outnumbered but he managed to hold his position. Both sides eventually withdrew their forces.|$|E
