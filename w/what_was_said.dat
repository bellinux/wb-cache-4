5|$|Antiquarian curiosity in {{the castle}} had begun as early as 1700, when Peter Le Neve visited and {{recorded}} some of the architectural details, but interest increased in the 19th century. This was partially due {{to the work of}} the local curate, the Reverend J. Jackson, who undertook the first archaeological excavations at the site during the 1840s, uncovering many of the foundations of the inner court. 17th and 18th century stained glass windows from the continent were installed in the chapel, where the 15th century wall paintings were rediscovered in 1844. The then owner, Colonel John Houlton, turned the chapel into a museum of curiosities, where for a small fee visitors could see sets of armour, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> to be a pair of Oliver Cromwell's boots and other English Civil War artefacts, including letters from Cromwell written to the Hungerfords.|$|E

What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of Grice’s theory of conversation is the drawing of a borderline between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> implicated. Grice’s views concerning this borderline have been strongly and influentially criticised by relevance theorists. In particular, it has become increasingly widely accepted that Grice’s notion of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> too limited, and that pragmatics has a far larger role to play in determining <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> than Grice would have allowed.

5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said,</b> the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E

5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> in trial, making it easier to determine bias or improper conduct on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E

[...] <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> to <b>be</b> [...] "in" [...] a subject is a predicate that does not describe it as a whole but cannot exist without the subject, such as the shape of something.

40|$|It {{seems to}} be a common and {{intuitively}} plausible assumption that conversational implicatures arise only when one of the so-called conversational maxims is violated at the level of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said.</b> The basic idea behind this thesis is that, unless a maxim is violated at the level of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said,</b> nothing can trigger the search for an implicature.

25|$|Bullshit {{does not}} {{necessarily}} {{have to be a}} complete fabrication.

Thus bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth which is likely to lead to falsehoods.|$|R

40|$|Language {{activity}} {{is based on}} a symbolic gap between the actual state of affairs and their representation, through speech, in a linguistic system. This implies a measurement of the distance between the thought contained within <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> being referred to in saying it; the distance between the various possible ways of saying; and the distance, in an inter-subjective relationship, between the speaker and the other with whom he is communicating. From a linguistic standpoint, this assessment resembles processes for evaluating utterances according to a two-dimensional validation (how <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> validated or able to be validated) and valuation (how <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> valid). Valuation also concerns forms of enunciation which <b>are</b> conditional upon <b>what</b> <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> or meant. These considerations are based upon the notions of referential value and adjustment in Culioli’s theory of enunciative operations. This theory is first examined, in order that the measuring process – how to say it – may be understood. The process is then demonstrated through the examination of a text and study of the marker en quelque sorte...|$|R

One should also note how these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain free semilattices, where we only need to consider finite sets.|$|E
