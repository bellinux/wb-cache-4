5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was {{opposition to the}} construction of Trump Tower and other buildings in the area.

5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the dangers of {{radioactive}} pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
40|$|Social {{scientists}} have always <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> {{the role of}} religion for society. In the early twentieth century, there <b>were</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the compatibility of Catholicism and liberal democracy; in the post-Cold War period, there <b>were</b> <b>concerns</b> that international relations might be marked by a ‘Clash of Civilizations’; and today there <b>are</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the compatibility of Islam and ‘Western culture’.

5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> {{the threat of a}} royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

But new research shows that parents don 2 ̆ 7 t back up their concerns with meaningful actions, and that in any event they might well <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the wrong risks. Research by "For Safety 2 ̆ 7 s Sake" (PDF) for Microsoft Australia found that while 64 per cent of parents <b>were</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> cyber-safety, 65 per cent don 2 ̆ 7 t use any parental control software and 62 per cent allow their kids to access the internet unsupervised...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Following The Painted Hills in 1951, MGM {{executives}} felt Lassie had run her {{course and}} planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought {{a way to}} break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> protecting Pal and the Lassie image he had created from future diminishment {{at the hands of}} others. In lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed him by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.|$|E

He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs because of increased mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming {{more interested in the}} lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E

5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and he <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Maeser left the Lyceum and was offered a {{position}} at the Union Academy, established by Brigham Young. This academy was intended for students above elementary grades. Young appointed Maeser head of the school in February 1861. Maeser <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the school systems meeting the needs and interests of its students, and he left the Union Academy to teach in other schools and seminaries, including the Twentieth Ward Seminary, which he founded in 1862. The school became a well-known training school for teachers.|$|E
5|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Final Frontiers sound designer; he had {{previously}} worked on The Voyage Home. Because Mangini <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> creating continuity within Star Treks sounds, he decided to reuse some effects rather than create new and different-sounding ones— as such, the Bird of Prey's cloak effect, beaming sounds, and the Enterprise engines sound similar to past movies. Mangini collaborated with Shatner to work out how the completely new effects would sound. For Sybok's mind melds, Shatner wanted the sounds of beating hearts and breathing.|$|E
5|$|On May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly {{one year}} after the Zürich ALGOL 58 meeting), a meeting was held at the Pentagon to discuss the {{creation}} of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips. The Department of Defense <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> whether it could run the same data processing programs on different computers. FORTRAN, the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the reliability of suspension bridges {{and did not want}} a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> {{the results}} of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
