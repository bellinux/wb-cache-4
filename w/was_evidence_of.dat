5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} micro-level {{evidence}} {{on the effects of}} trade and investment liberalization in the developing world. The main findings can be summarized as follows. 1) There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> trade-induced productivity gains; 2) These gains mainly stem from the intra-industry real-location of resources among firms with different productivity levels and: 3) they are larger in import competing sectors; 4) There <b>is</b> no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> significant scale efficiency gains. Indeed, unilateral trade liberalization is often associated with a reduced scale efficiency; 5) There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a pro-competitive effect of trade liberalization; 6) There <b>is</b> no <b>evidence</b> either <b>of</b> learning-by-exporting effects or of beneficial spillover effects from foreign owned to local firms; 7) There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> skill upgrading induced either by technology imports, or by trade-induced reallocations of market shares in favor of plants with higher skill-intensity; 8) There <b>is</b> no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> trade-induced increases in labor demand elasticities; 9) There <b>is</b> no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> substantial employment contraction in import competing sectors.

5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 {{to determine whether there}} <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|Demolition and The Hart Foundation {{had faced}} each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988, where Demolition had {{successfully}} defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team. They announced on the March 31 episode of WWF Superstars {{that they wanted to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship after the WrestleMania match between The Colossal Connection and Demolition. After Demolition won the match, The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. Demolition interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of WWF Superstars, Demolition and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that Demolition having three members <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was announced for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated {{that it would be a}} two out of three falls match and that only two members of Demolition would be allowed at ringside.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning {{as a way of}} enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special for {{her role}} as Candy Morrison in A Killing in a Small Town, which was based on Candy Montgomery's {{acquittal}} for the death of Betty Gore. Montgomery had killed Gore on Friday, June 13, 1980, in Gore's Wylie, Texas, home, by hitting her 41 times with an ax. The jury determined that she did so in self-defense. In preparation for the part, Hershey had a phone conversation with Montgomery. Many of the names of the real-life principals in the case were changed for the movie. The film's alternative title <b>was</b> <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> Love, the name of a 1984 book about the case.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{something that he}} and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression {{traveled to the}} northwest across the southwest Gulf of Mexico. It strengthened rapidly, and there <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> deep convection as it passed over warm waters. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on reconnaissance aircraft observation. Six hours later, the storm accelerated to near 9mph (15km/h), meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected, preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane. However, Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast, as it maintained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h). The lack of intensification {{could be due to}} moderate wind shear and entrainment over the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track to the northwest toward the Rio Grande Valley area in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Texas. The storm made landfall early on August 15 along the Mexican coast about 105mi (165km) south of Brownsville, Texas, 35mi (55km) north La Pesca, Tamaulipas and about 115mi (185km) north of Tampico. Beryl was downgraded to a {{tropical depression}} about five hours after landfall. The Brownsville radar showed that the circulation center of the storm became elongated parallel to the mountain ranges of northeastern Mexico, so the system was no longer declared a tropical depression late on August 15, while located near Monterrey.|$|E
