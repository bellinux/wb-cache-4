5|$|Her {{appearances}} {{became more}} regular from July 2014 onwards, with her stepping up her blackmail and revealing Ian's actions to Denise's protective father figure, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). In August 2014, Ian's friend Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, pulled over behind Ian and Rainie <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> them talking. Ian drove off and Rainie approaches Mick, believing {{him to be}} a customer of her prostitute services. The police then pulled up behind Mick, and arrested him for soliciting. When Ian explained Rainie's blackmail, Mick agreed to cover for him, {{to ensure the safety of}} his fake alibi. As a result of this, Rainie was reconciled with her mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), as Cora supported Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in court before bumping into her daughter. Rainie wants nothing to do with Cora, and pretends the allegations against Mick are true.|$|E
5|$|On 25July, Phillipps {{was leading}} the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armentières <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> a patrol of seven Fokkers. Jettisoning his bombs to lighten his load, he {{attacked}} one of the German fighters and shot away its wing; the others retreated. During the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive, on 12August, he joined fellow No.2 Squadron ace Adrian Cole and No.4 Squadron aces Harry Cobby and Roy King to lead their combined forces {{in support of the}} British Fourth Army, Phillipps accounting for a Fokker that broke up in mid-air. He was credited with two other victories in August to bring his tally to fifteen, making him No.2 Squadron's second most successful ace after Captain Francis Smith, who finished the war with sixteen. Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with Royal Air Force policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. In October, he was promoted to major and posted to command No.6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No.2 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud {{enlisted in}} the U.S. Army in 1948. After the Korean War began in June 1950, {{he was sent to}} Korea with the 19th Infantry, 24th Infantry Division, which was among the American troops who fought the first battles of the war, being pushed back during the Battle of Taejon and the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. The 19th Infantry also was part of the Eighth United States Army advance into North Korea. On the night of 5 November 1950, Red Cloud was manning a forward {{observation}} post <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> an imminent surprise attack by Chinese forces. Red Cloud single-handedly held off the Chinese forces despite being shot eight times, at one point ordering his men to tie him to a tree because he was too weak to stand by himself. His company found him the next morning, surrounded by dead Chinese troops. He was credited with alerting his company to the ambush and saving them from being overrun. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E

25|$|Iceland was {{discovered}} by Naddodd, {{one of the first}} settlers on the Faroe Islands, who was sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands but got lost and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddoddr named the country Snæland (Snowland). Swedish sailor Garðar Svavarsson also accidentally drifted to the coast of Iceland. He discovered that the country was an island and named it Garðarshólmi (literally Garðar's Islet) and stayed for the winter at Húsavík. The first Scandinavian who deliberately sailed to Garðarshólmi was Flóki Vilgerðarson, also known as Hrafna-Flóki (Raven-Flóki). Flóki settled for one winter at Barðaströnd. It was a cold winter, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> some drift ice in the fjords he gave the island its current name, Ísland (Iceland).|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1905, Grand Duke Sergei, who had {{recently}} resigned from the post of Governor General of Moscow, was assassinated by Ivan Kalyaev, {{a member of the}} Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Kalyaev, armed with a homemade bomb, had aborted his first attempt to kill the Grand Duke <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> Dmitri and Marie with their uncle in his carriage. His uncle's death was only one of several assassinations that robbed Dmitri of close family members. After Sergei's death, Grand Duchess Elizabeth undertook to raise her niece and nephew on her own, thus making them part of a rare female-headed household. Maria Pavlovna continued to have some feelings of anger toward her aunt, whom she would blame for her overly hasty marriage to Prince William of Sweden in 1908, but Dmitri formed a very strong bond with Elizabeth and came to admire her personal fortitude.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck.

25|$|Just after Bader's {{section of}} four {{aircraft}} crossed the coast, 12 Bf 109s were spotted flying in formation approximately 2,000 to 3,000feet (600 to 900 metres) below them and travelling {{in the same}} direction. Bader dived on them too fast and too steeply {{to be able to}} aim and fire his guns, and barely avoided colliding with one of them. He levelled out at 24,000feet (7,300metres) to find that he was now alone, separated from his section, and was considering whether to return home <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> three pairs of Bf 109s a couple of miles in front of him. He dropped down below them and closed up before destroying one of them with a short burst of fire from close range. Bader was just opening fire on a second Bf 109, which trailed white smoke and dropped down, when he noticed the two on his left turning towards him. At this point he decided {{it would be better to}} return home; however, making the mistake of banking away from them, Bader believed he had a mid-air collision with the second of the two Bf 109s on his right that were continuing straight ahead.|$|E

500|$|Employed as a foreman by Boulton and Watt in Birmingham, Perrins {{was sent}} {{around the country}} by the firm. In 1787 he visited Scotland, from where he {{reported}} on an invention by the Symingtons which might possibly have infringed a patent held by his employers, although Watt was disparaging of the device and its creator. He installed the first Boulton and Watt stationary steam engine in Manchester, at Drinkwater's Mill in 1789. He was there again by June 1791, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>spotted</b> {{a copy of a}} Boulton and Watt product in Deansgate, one of many examples which infringed the firm's patents.

She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern {{of the other two}} ships. Admiral Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range, but this blinded the Russian gunners and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese. About 06:00 Admiral Jessen turned 180° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron. Admiral Kamimura followed suit around 06:10, but turned to port, which opened the range between the squadrons. Azuma developed engine problems around this time so the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed. Firing recommenced at 06:24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern, flooding her steering compartment so that she had to be steered with her engines. Her speed continued to decrease, further exposing her to Japanese fire, and her steering jammed to port around 06:40.|$|E
