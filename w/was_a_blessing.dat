500|$|The Nazis firmly {{fought the}} austrofascist regime of {{chancellor}} Engelbert Dollfuss, and orchestrated his assassination. They continued this battle against his successor, Kurt Schuschnigg. Austrofacism was strongly supported by Benito Mussolini, leader of Fascist Italy. Mussolini's {{support for an}} independent Austria {{can be seen in}} a discussion he had with Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, an important Austrian nationalist and Heimwehr leader. He said that [...] "an Anschluss with Germany must never be permitted... Austria is necessary to the maintenance of Europe... the day that Austria falls and is swallowed up by Germany will mark the beginning of European chaos." [...] The austrofascist party, Fatherland Front, would echo the sentiments of Mussolini, and continue to struggle for an independent Austria. Nazis in both Germany and Austria intended that the German Reich would quickly annex Austria, the homeland of its leader, Adolf Hitler. They attempted to bribe many low-ranking Heimwehr leaders, and also attempted to bring Starhemberg into their fold, in effect merging the Heimwehr with the Nazi Freikorps. Gregor Strasser, a prominent Nazi figure, was charged with this effort. When Starhemberg, a fervent believer in an independent Austria, rejected his merger proposal, Strasser said [...] "Don't talk to me about Austria. There is no Austria... there was once a living corpse which called itself Austria... that this Austria collapsed in 1918 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing...</b> particularly for the German people, who were thereby given the chance to create a Greater Germany." ...|$|E

500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing.</b> They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis.

2500|$|Even {{though some}} of the older {{generation}} of singers didn't have the financial means to make cassettes, they have influenced Ethiopian music in various ways while singing in local churches. One of the earlier singers is Addisu Worku, who used to sing through Misrach voice Radio. An early church to develop other singers was Mulu Wongel church, since the church itself was mainly started by Ethiopians, as opposed to the foreign relations other Evangelical churches had with European and American missionaries. So when other churches sang and learned songs in foreign languages, Mulu Wongel church, which began in Addis Ababa, introduced Amharic gospel songs in late 1960s. However, since Mulu Wongel church itself didn't have foreign support, its members faced persecution more often. Yet this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> in disguise for Evangelical Christians, since Mulu Wongel members attending other churches influenced them not only in faith but in music also. Even though Mulu Wongel church was closed by the government, its two choir groups, the Mulu Wongel choir and Tsion choir continued to develop and sing uniquely Ethiopian songs across the county. Subsequently, in the early 1970s the Meserete Kristos church choir was established. [...] Some from Tsion Choir from Mulu Wongel joined the newly established choir and Meserete Kristos continued developing songs in Ethiopian languages. During these early years, other groups like Bethel singers also produced Ethiopian gospel songs.|$|E

[...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them.
