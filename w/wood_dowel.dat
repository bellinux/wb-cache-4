50|$|A {{pinstriping}} brush is {{the tool}} of traditional free hand pinstripers use for pinstriping. Freehand pinstriping {{is the most}} difficult method of pinstriping and the brush is an important tool for design. Pinstriping brushes have several different designs, Swords, Daggers, and Flats, as well as Double line brushes. The brush consists of a small <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> handle, string or brass fixture with adhesive and brush hairs traditionally made from squirrel hair (confusingly called camel hair). The small <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> is balanced so pinstripers can freely spin the brush between their fingers. The dowel's short length is so the brush does not hit the palm of the hand while the brush is placed in-between the index finger and thumb. The hair of a pinstriping brush is relatively long at approximately 2 inches,or more, compared to most artistic brushes of a similar size. This long length is to hold the necessary amount of paint to pull a long line.|$|E
30|$|Birch (Betula spp.) <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> were 10  mm in {{diameter}} and 100  mm in length. The air-dried density at 12 % MC of the birch dowel was 557  kg/m 3. The MC of <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> was 2 %. <b>Wood</b> <b>dowels</b> were treated in the drying oven whose temperature was set to 63  °C, until 2 % MC was achieved. The <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> {{were divided into two}} categories including an untreated group and a pretreated group. The <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> of pretreated group were immersed in 0.1  mol/L CuCl 2 solution for 30  min and then dried to 2 % MC. The temperature of the CuCl 2 solution during immersion was around 20 – 25  °C, which is the indoor temperature in the laboratory. The study tried six different treatment times, 10, 20, 30  min, and 1, 2, and 4  h. After the preliminary experiment, it was found that 30  min was the best choice.|$|R
30|$|According {{to several}} studies, welding {{properties}} could be significantly improved using smaller pre-drilled holes, dry <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> {{and increasing the}} contact area with non-vertical insertion methods. The smaller pre-drilled holes may increase the lateral pressure between the <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> and the pre-drilled holes. The <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> may provide more materials for the interface. Dry <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> after welding may absorb water from the environment. <b>Wood</b> <b>dowels</b> {{in a state of}} inflation may increase the bonding strength [11, 14 – 17]. It was found that native extractives of some special wood species could improve the water resistance [18 – 20]. Placencia and Pizzi compared welded joints with and without additives and found that welded joints with natural additives (rosin and lignin) showed improved water resistance [21, 22]. Water extracts of welded beech and welded spruce were analyzed after hydrolysis of welded materials and amounts of lignin, mono-oligosaccharides, acetic acid, vanillin, furfural, 5 hydroxymethylfurfural, and syringaldehyde were measured [23].|$|R

50|$|Collectors have {{determined}} that the only Everest LPs worth having are those that were recorded and pressed while Belock was at the company. Identifying these records is relatively easy: the first issues sport a silver/turquoise label (with the earliest of these having a <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> on the outside edge of the inner sleeve). The silver paper used on these covers usually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The second label is a purple mountain. The entire classical catalog of Belock Everests is relatively small, fewer than 100 LPs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{exploratory research}} related to novel full-scale multi-layered timber beams with composite action achieved with welded-through <b>wood</b> <b>dowels.</b> Different multi-layer beam designs, where the timber layers were interconnected with welded <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> providing interlayer shear resistance, were tested in bending with different dowel densities. The main originality {{of this study is}} the achievement of dowel welds through greater depths of sections than has previously proved possible. The practical difficulties encountered in constructing deeper multi-layer beams, and the successful solutions arrived at, are discussed. The significance of the research reported is the demonstrated ability to produce multilayered timber sections which are structurally efficient and do not require non timber based joining agents such as nails or adhesive...|$|R
30|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanics and pyrolysis analyses of rotation welding with treated dowels. Test results indicated that welding specimens with dowels immersed in CuCl 2 solution exhibited higher pullout resistance than untreated specimens. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe and analyze the welding interface. <b>Wood</b> <b>dowels</b> immersed in CuCl 2 solution provided more flowing molten polymer to obtain better connection than untreated <b>wood</b> <b>dowels.</b> Based on the chemical analyses of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyses, the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose was detected after immersion of the dowels in a CuCl 2 solution. Pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin occurred during the welding process. The hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose may promote the pyrolysis and efficient connection of wood components during the welding process.|$|R
30|$|A 7.17 % {{increase}} in the O/C ratio was identified for the treated <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> versus the untreated <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> (Table  2) because the cellulose and hemicellulose were hydrolyzed in the acid solution due to the CuCl 2 and the rupture of the glycosidic bond. During hydrolysis, the long chain of cellulose was broken into short ones due to chain scission and the hydrolysis of the compounds for hemicellulose resulted {{in the formation of}} hexose and pentose [41]. The same phenomenon was found in the PY-GC-MS test, deacetylate occurred during the immersing process. According to these reactions, the portion of C 1 and C 3 decreased 5.66 and 18.26 %, respectively, and the portion of C 2 increased 21.52 %.|$|R
5000|$|The average Chinese home uses some {{variation}} of the rectangular-bladed knife, usually around 18 cm to 28 cm (7-11 inches) in length. Traditional knives had a simply-forged, carbon steel blade with a long, ground bevel, but the typical Chinese chef's knife is now a stamped blade. The traditional handle is a full-length tang that is only about 1 or 2 cm wide, which is passed through a metal cap, then {{through the center of}} a round, <b>wood</b> <b>dowel,</b> then bent over and hammered into the end of the handle to retain it. Newer models, particularly those made in Japan or Germany, have full-width tangs and riveted or injection-molded handles, but these handles generally retain something of the traditional, round cross-section. The wide blade of Caidao keeps the cook's fingers well off the cutting surface and the round handle gives a nice [...] "pivot point" [...] for the cutting stroke. The blade has a curvature or rocker along its edge that is generally uniform, improving the knife's ability to chop and mince meats and vegetables. The broad rectangular blade also serves to scoop up chopped food for transport to the wok or bowl. Although it may seem unwieldy, skilled practitioners worldwide may be observed using this style of knife for everything — even carving and fine work normally accomplished with a paring knife.|$|E
30|$|The {{theoretical}} temperature {{may reach}} 456.65  K during <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding in 0.9 – 1.2  s due to friction [8]. Then, the temperature reduces to 413.15  K without additional interface materials. The well-distributed molten polymer {{generated by the}} increased temperature affects the water resistance. The <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding joints perform well with increased water resistance. No obvious delamination appeared after 8 months in a humid environment because of the special <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding connection [9].|$|E
30|$|From the TG curves in Fig.  3 a, the {{pyrolysis}} {{course of}} the welding interface {{was similar to that}} of <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> except for the final weight loss, which was lower for the welding interface. This phenomenon could be caused by the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose during the welding process, resulting in a higher relative content of lignin in welding interface than in the <b>wood</b> <b>dowel.</b> Based on this, the welding interface produced more coke than <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> during the TG testing process.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to characterize the}} secant shearing stiffness of welding-through <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> used in multi-layer spruce beams. Welding-through <b>wood</b> <b>dowel's</b> stiffness behaviour as well as isostatic multi-layer beams' behaviour were investigated experimentally. These elements are made by a specifically designed machine to guarantee repeatability. A model of finite elements was developed to reproduce the bending behaviour of the beams tested from non-linear connection behaviour. This model is then used to study the influence of parameters such as: layer number, spacing of dowels, load type (concentrated or distributed), strength class and beam span. After a sensibility analysis, a parameterized regression model allows to obtain k (ser) and k (u) fastener secant stiffness in compliance with EN 1995 - 1 standard to design multi-layer beams in an elastic analytical model way. This model {{is based on the}} work by Kreuzinger (1999) ...|$|R
30|$|TG {{analysis}} showed that the enhancement mechanism of <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> pretreated with CuCl 2 was that acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose of <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> occurred {{during the process of}} CuCl 2 immersion. This method promoted the formation of more molten materials by the depolymerization and pyrolysis of the wood constituents.|$|E
30|$|The XPS {{analyses}} of <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> and welding interface was performed because the materials of the welding interface were mostly {{generated from the}} <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> [10]. During the XPS test, Cu and Cl were not identified, because few of them existed in the samples. So in the XPS test, the element of C, O, and N were detected. But according to the pyrolysis–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PY-GC-MS) test, little amount of Cl existed in the treated <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> and welding interface. The content of elements and the oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio for the wood dowels and the welding interface were shown in Table  2. The quantitative analyses were performed by peak fitting for the C 1 s categories. Deconvolution for the four types of carbon bonds was performed (Table  2) for the peaks from the <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> and welding interface and were determined as C 1 class (C–C/C–H bonds, 284.6  eV), C 2 class (C–O bonds, 286.5  eV), C 3 class (C=O/O–C–O bonds, 287.9  eV) and C 4 class (O=C–O bonds, 289.2  eV) [25].|$|E
30|$|Chemical changes {{occurred}} in the wood components including the depolymerization and pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin during welding. According to the research of Karl-Christian, acid-catalyzed cleavage of carbohydrates {{and the formation of}} formaldehyde, furfural, and other aldehydes occurred with the elevated temperature. In addition, lignin was cleaved and began auto-condensation [24]. With the changes in the wood components, the free phenolic hydroxyl groups increased and formed the hydrogen bonds with the cellulose to strengthen the stability of the interface [25, 26], and the hydroxyl benzene propane unit decreased [27]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide were the primary components of the volatile gas in the welding process [28 – 30]. The <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding joints showed improved pullout resistance [31, 32]. The pullout resistance property of the <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding joints is equivalent to that of <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> joints with adhesives, and better than that of nailed joints [33]. <b>Wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding may also be used to enhance the mortise and tenon interference fit connection [34]. Novel full-scale multi-layered timber beams with welded-through wood dowels obtained considerable bending strength [35].|$|E
30|$|The pullout {{resistance}} of the specimens was tested using universal testing equipment (WDW- 300 E) that pulled the welding <b>wood</b> <b>dowels</b> out of the substrate at a speed of 2  mm/min [11].

30|$|From Table  3, pullout {{resistance}} of group B showed the highest value. The fracture of the specimens from group B {{occurred in the}} <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> surface instead of welding interface. So it could be inferred that the pullout {{resistance of}} <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding in this study has been reached the maximum value. According to this result, the difference of temperature between them during welding process should be tested to explain the reason of improved pullout resistance.|$|E
30|$|The {{pretreatment}} {{methods of}} wood dowels were analyzed. Wood dowels soaked in ethylene glycol for 10  min could improve the pullout resistance by 98.05 % [5]. Similar conclusion {{was obtained from}} Chedeville [4]. The interactions rotation rate/ethylene glycol were the second most significant in <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> welding. While the treatment with sunflower oil and water reduced the pullout resistance [5]. Amirous also found that citric acid was used as waterproofing additive in butt joints linear wood welding [9]. And in our previous study, <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> with diameter of 12  mm pretreated in 0.1  mol/L CuCl 2 acid solution with immersion time of 1, 3, 5, and 7 days were studied. So {{it was necessary to}} analyze the influence of shorter immersion time on <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> with the diameter of 10  mm and the pullout resistance. Meanwhile, the influence of pretreatment on temperature of welding interface should be studied.|$|E
30|$|The {{pyrolysis}} {{of cellulose}} and hemicellulose during welding process was {{revealed by the}} Derivative thermogravimetric analyses (DTG) curves (Fig.  3 b). The pyrolysis rate of the welding interface was obviously {{lower than that of}} <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> in the temperature range of 500 – 600  K. This {{may be due to the}} pyrolysis of hemicellulose during the welding process. Additionally, the pyrolysis rate of the welding interface was lower than that of the <b>wood</b> <b>dowel</b> around 635  K likely due to the pyrolysis of cellulose during the welding process.|$|E
30|$|Based on Eq.  23, {{the theory}} of maximum 95 % {{reliability}} pullout resistance of 1735  N at depth 40.75  mm was calculated. And the fastest growing stage was at depth 20 – 30  mm. These results also explained that the welded depth should not exceed 40  mm. For consideration of reducing processing difficulty and rapture rate of <b>wood</b> <b>dowels,</b> depth 30  mm was selected for the next study.|$|R
