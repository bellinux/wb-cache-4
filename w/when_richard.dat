5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and might have taken part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. <b>When</b> <b>Richard,</b> Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E

Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. <b>When</b> <b>Richard</b> died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he had changed his mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E
5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard labor for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 <b>when</b> <b>Richard</b> Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

5|$|Hugh's son, Roger Bigod, {{was out of}} favour with Henry, who {{initially}} denied him the family earldom and estates such as Framlingham. Roger finally regained royal favour <b>when</b> <b>Richard</b> I succeeded to the throne in 1189. Roger then set about building a new castle on the Framlingham site – the work was conducted relatively quickly and the castle was certainly complete by 1213. The new castle comprised the Inner Court, defended with 13 mural towers; an adjacent Lower Court with smaller stone walls and towers, and a larger Bailey with timber defences. By this time, a castle-guard system was in place at Framlingham, in which lands were granted to local lords {{in return for their}} providing knights or soldiers to guard the castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Sands became deputy {{director}} for the construction and early operation of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). <b>When</b> <b>Richard</b> Feynman was deciding {{whether or not to}} accept the 1965 Nobel Prize—due to a disdain for the added notoriety it might bring—Sands convinced Feynman that not accepting it would bring even more attention. Sands later joined the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for science from 1969 to 1972. After retiring from UCSC in 1985, Sands worked as a consultant for SLAC and also as a consultant for Bay View Elementary School and Santa Cruz High School in Santa Cruz, California, developing computer systems and physics lab activities for students.|$|E
5|$|Lambda is an {{advanced}} lifeform created on Fodra. His mistreatment by humans fueled his hatred towards them. During the party's childhood, he resides inside Richard {{after he was}} injured by Sophie and as a result, saved Richard's life. Seven years later, Lambda is reawakened <b>when</b> <b>Richard</b> receives a fatal wound. Lambda empowers Richard and manipulates him to achieve his goals of destroying humanity. After he is defeated by the party, Lambda is absorbed by Asbel who convinces him to give humans a chance. In Lineage and Legacies, he absorbs Fodra's consciousness to dissuade her hatred as Asbel did for him. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara and dubbed by Keith Silverstein.|$|E
50|$|The team only {{missed out}} at Bathurst <b>when</b> <b>Richards</b> {{finished}} in fourth place partnered with Longhurst after being delayed for three laps in a sand trap <b>when</b> <b>Richards</b> spun on oil. The team's second car, driven by car owner Crichton {{who had also}} driven {{the car in the}} ATCC and finished in fourth in his championship debut, and on-loan Nissan Motorsport driver George Fury, finished second at Sandown after leading until late in the race when Crichton was slowed by a reported shortage of fuel. In a twist of fate, as Richards was sliding off into the sand trap at Bathurst, George Fury, who Richards had just lapped, joined him having gone off on the same oil. The second car only completed 68 laps before being retired with engine failure which was attributed to the amount of sand the engine had 'swallowed' in the sand trap.|$|R

He retained this role {{until the end of}} the 2004/2005 season, when he left to take up a coaching role at the National Academy.|$|R
5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position of the marsh (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue of the marsh. <b>When</b> <b>Richard</b> began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what {{came to be known as}} Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.|$|E
5|$|Possession of Bodiam Castle {{passed through}} {{several generations of}} Dalyngrigges, until their line became extinct, when the castle passed by {{marriage}} to the Lewknor family. During the Wars of the Roses, Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster, and <b>when</b> <b>Richard</b> III of the House of York became king in 1483, a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle. It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead, but {{it is thought that}} Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance. The castle was confiscated, but returned to the Lewknors when Henry VII of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485. Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Richard was {{captured}} by Leopold on his return journey. He was transferred to Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, and a 25-percent tax on goods and income was required to pay his 150,000-mark ransom. Philip II of France had overrun Normandy, while John of England controlled much of Richard's remaining lands. However, <b>when</b> <b>Richard</b> returned to England he forgave John and re-established his control. Leaving England permanently in 1194, Richard fought Philip for five years {{for the return of}} holdings seized during his incarceration. On the brink of victory, he was wounded by an arrow during the siege of Château de Châlus-Chabrol and died ten days later.|$|E
5000|$|At {{that first}} meet in 1942, [...] "Dutch" [...] Warmerdam set {{a world record}} in the pole vault with a bamboo pole.

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Richards</b> {{announced}} her {{plans to do}} a reality show in 2007, she {{received a lot of}} negative press coverage, mostly due to objections over the use of her children in the series and overhyped publicity she has done in promoting the show prior to its debut.
