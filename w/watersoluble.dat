The thesis is based on the long stationary experiments founded by the Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture. The analysed soil came from experimental localities: the sugar beet growing region (Uherský Ostroh, Věrovany, Žatec) and the potato processing region (Chrastava, Staňkov, Svitavy, Horažďovice, Lípa). Five options of fertilization were included with a different dosage (intensity) of potassium in kg. ha- 1 depending on the region (potato and sugar beet growing) : 1. A checking option without fertilization (0; 0), 2. farmyard manure (35; 35), 3. farmyard manure + N 2 P 2 K 0 (35; 35), 4. farmyard manure + N 2 P 2 K 1 (104; 96) 5. farmyard manure + N 2 P 2 K 2 (143, 132), 6. farmyard manure + N 2 P 2 K 3 (193, 178). <b>Watersoluble</b> potassium was statistically provable influenced by the increasing of dosage of fertilization. The content of <b>watersoluble</b> potassium is within the producing region very varied. It was the soil type who was the most influential on the variability of the <b>watersoluble</b> potassium (35, 3 %). The content of <b>watersoluble</b> K was due to the application of potassium increasing the most in the heavy soil. The content of available potassium increased after the application of 1 kg K by 0, 6289 mg. kg- 1. The variant of fertilization participated on the overall variability of the content of available potassium by 32, 48 %. In the potato-growing region was the amount of potassium lower than in sugar beet region by 89, 5 mg. kg- 1 of soil. The lowest figures were found in cambisol. The group of the type of soil influenced significantly the amount of observed form of K. The reserve of mobile potassium wasn't significantly influenced by fertilization.
