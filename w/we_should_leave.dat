But there arose before us from the decks below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on the Boat Deck facing us and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had just come up from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{died with}} his {{reputation}} in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the [...] "saviour of Greece" [...] {{had turned into}} the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450sBC, {{and by the time}} Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: [...] "Now {{on the subject of the}} high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>leave</b> his great ability unrecorded." [...] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that [...] "But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius." [...] Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as Alexander the Great and Hannibal, this is high praise indeed. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Frank {{authored}} the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act (H.R. 2592), {{an attempt}} to stop the federal government from preempting states' medical marijuana laws. He has consistently voted for the bipartisan Hinchey-Rohrabacher amendment, annually proposed by Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), that would prohibit the United States Department of Justice from prosecuting medical marijuana patients. In March 2008, he proposed the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008 (HR 5843), which would have decriminalized small amounts of the drug, but which died in committee during the 110th Congress. [...] On June 18, 2009, he re-introduced the bill as the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2009 (HR 2943). Commenting on legislation to remove federal criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, Frank stated [...] "In a free society a large degree of human activity is none of the government's business. We should make criminal what's going to hurt other people and other than that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>leave</b> it to people {{to make their own}} choices." [...] In 2003, he was rated [...] "A" [...] by Vote Hemp, indicating a pro-hemp voting record. In 2006 he was rated [...] "+30" [...] by NORML, indicating a pro-drug-reform stance. In 2007 he co-sponsored the [...] "Drug Sentencing Reform & Kingpin Trafficking Act" [...] ((S.1711) 07-S1711) to [...] "target cocaine kingpins and address sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine". In 2008, Frank sponsored [...] "Removing Impediments to Students Education" [...] (RISE) ((H.R.5157) 08-HR5157) to allow rehabilitated drug offenders to get student loans.|$|E

500|$|In June 2015, Feige {{confirmed}} that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, [...] "We hint at a temper {{in a way that}} people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [...] character,' but not {{in a way that would}} ever indicate [...]" [...] Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence [...] "that may tie into the other films." [...] Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by Anthony and Joe Russo for , saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be [...] "different takes...different angles." [...] On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of Ant-Man was officially complete. In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon. Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, respectively. Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War. Also in the month, Reed revealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU's version of the microverse, which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the California Institute of Technology, to [...] "inject elements of modern physics into the script". Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, [...] "...But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>leave</b> those particles out there." [...] For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, with the credits [...] "intricately connected to the film's overall narrative." ...|$|E

Foot reports Stephenson as saying: [...] "It was my fifth year in charge and we'd got to the Bath Festival.
