25|$|Zen is the Japanese {{variant of}} Chan Buddhism, a Mahayana school that {{strongly}} emphasizes dhyana concentration-meditation. This practice, according to Zen proponents, gives insight into one's true nature, or {{the emptiness of}} inherent existence, which opens {{the way to a}} liberated <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{association}} with several writers, Póvoa as a stage for literary works is rare. Notable exceptions are Luis Sepúlveda's The Worst Stories of the Grim Brothers (in Spanish, Los peores cuentos de los hermanos Grim) and António Nobre who watched Povoan fishermen at sea, sailed with them and wrote poetry about them and their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} depicts suburbs as {{becoming more}} heterogeneous {{in terms of}} socio-economic status. Providing a novel analysis, this paper engages with that research by operationalising suburban <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> (homeownership, single-family dwelling occupancy and automobile use) and relating them to the geography of income across 26 Canadian metropolitan areas. We find that suburban <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> exist in new areas and remain associated with higher incomes even as older suburbs, as places, have become more diverse. In the largest cities the relationship between income and suburban <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> is weaker due {{to the growth of}} condominiums in downtowns that allow higher income earners to live urban lifestyles. Homeownership is overwhelmingly more important than other variables in explaining the geography of income across 26 metropolitan areas. geography of income; income; suburbanisms; suburban <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> living; suburb...|$|R

25|$|As for {{its more}} recent history, {{the period of}} the duchies is of special interest. During this period — from the 14th century to the year 1864 – Ærø was united and separated, alternately, into a number of enclaves. Ærø was outside the tariff wall of the Kingdom, leading to flourishing {{smuggling}} which was a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> for many of Ærø's inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Fisheries have {{traditionally}} been the most important <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> along the coast, {{where the majority of}} the Norwegian population live. The red king crab, originally from the northern Pacific ocean but brought to the Barents sea by the Russians, have invaded from the east and are now being exploited commercially (especially in the Varangerfjord). To prevent the crab from spreading too far south, crab fishing west of Nordkapp is totally unregulated.|$|E

25|$|In {{the making}} of the art, colored weft and light colors were used for the main illustrations. This proved to be {{difficult}} to the authors. Ohkawa believes the art in general was influenced by the years in which the manga was published. This is reflected in how Clamp's artwork changed, the clothing and most notably Hokuto's dresses. In retrospective, Clamp found this work was completely different from RG Veda as it was completely written by them and was also influenced by their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jazz {{played a}} {{critical}} role during the Cold War in establishing political ties. Producer Willis Conover explained jazz as an embodiment of an anti-ideology or an alternative <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> by introducing a new style of music with a lose structure and improvisation. In November 1955, the New York Times declared Louis Armstrong as America's most effective ambassador. What American diplomats could not do, Armstrong and his jazz music did. This article claimed that musicians, such as Armstrong, created a universal language to communicate.|$|E

Trixie is a troublemaker with little respect for rules and other people. Pixel is an inventor who displays anti-social behavior and spends too much time on his computer. Stingy has a self-centered attitude and is possessive of nearly everything in town.

25|$|The two {{competing}} theories concerning {{the origins of}} reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, {{as opposed to being}} simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by Karl Marx, a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.|$|E
25|$|Thеre are {{original}} {{themes in}} the Transfiguration of God Chapel in the Hrelyo Tower situated in the Rila Monastery. In the dome is depicted the composition Sophia-Great Wisdom of God and in the narthex Psalms of David. The scenes Musicians and Horo are especially interesting because they represent the cloths and the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> of the Bulgarians during the 14th century. There are scenes of Saint Ivan of Rila life. Although there are relatively few preserved monuments of the Tarnovo School of Painting, they refute the popular opinion that the religious murals are inveterate {{and that they are}} inappropriate for artistic imagination.|$|E
25|$|Sponges {{have around}} 6 {{different}} types of cells that can perform different functions. Sponges are a good model for studying the origin of multicellularity because the cells are capable of communicating {{with one another and}} re-aggregating. In an experiment conducted by Henry Van Peters Wilson in 1910, it was found that cells from dissociated sponges could send out signals and recognize each other to form a new individual. This suggests that the cells that compose sponges are capable of independent living, however once multicellularity was possible then aggregating together to form one organism was a more efficient <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b>|$|E

25|$|Survival {{international}} {{has also}} pointed out in their campaigns against the assault on their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> {{the effect of the}} work of missionaries. The Arhuaco, Ayoreo, Aborigines, the Innu and several tribes in West Papua have all suffered direct attacks on their culture from what, in the perspective of Survival, may constitute good intention, but nevertheless is destructive to their lives. The children of the Khanty and Wanniyala-Aetto have been kidnapped to be raised in foreign religions and culture. In the long run, these practices are successful in assimilating and destroying a group of people.|$|E
25|$|In 1744 he {{produced}} the Ménages assortis and in 1746 his masterpiece, the Coquette fixée. He {{was a close}} friend of Charles Simon Favart and his wife. His pen was always at the service of any of his friends, and it was generally supposed that he had a considerable share in Favart's most successful operas. Voisenon had scruples all his life about the incongruity between his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and his profession, but he continued to write indecent stories for private circulation, and wrote verses in honor of Madame du Barry, as he had done for Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
25|$|To {{take his}} {{followers}} {{away from the}} corrupting influence of non-Doukhobors and Edinolichniki ('individual owners') Doukhobors, and to find better conditions for agriculture, Verigin, starting in 1908, bought large tracts of land in south-eastern British Columbia. His first purchase was near the US border around Grand Forks. Later, he acquired large tracts of land further east, in the Slocan Valley around Castlegar. Between 1908 and 1912, some 8,000 people moved to these British Columbia lands from Saskatchewan, to continue their communal <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> In the milder climate of British Columbia, the settlers were able to plant fruit trees, {{and within a few}} years became renowned orchardists and producers of fruit preserves.|$|E
