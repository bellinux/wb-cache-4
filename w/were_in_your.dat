40|$|This {{relative}} clause puzzle concerns a systematic {{and not yet}} understood difference between finite and infinitival relatives in English. Earlier work on the topic (see, for example, Chomsky and Lasnik 1977, Rizzi 1990, Déprez 1995 for discussion) has not yet provided a satisfactory account of the pattern illustrated here. In infinitival subject (1) and non-subject (2) -(3) {{relative clause}}s an overt relative pronoun is excluded. Only the empty operator is possible. (1) a. The man [Op [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The man [who [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (2) a. The book [Op [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The book [which [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (3) a. A linguist [Op [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *A linguist [whom [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. This restriction does not hold for finite relative clauses. As shown in the (b) -examples below, an overt wh-element can <b>be</b> used <b>in</b> all corresponding finite relative sentences: (4) a. *The man [Op [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. The man [who [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office...|$|R

2500|$|The Mackinnon {{chief was}} later {{captured}} by Government troops {{and spent a}} year in confinement before being put on trial, with his life at stake, in Tilbury Fort.

2500|$|Agnes knelt and, crying, begged President Juárez {{to forgive}} the Emperor. The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: [...] "It causes me great pain, Madame, {{to see you}} like that on your knees; but even if every king and queen <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> place, I couldn't spare his life. It isn't me who takes it from him, it is {{the people and the}} law who claim his life". Juárez had already {{received}} telegraphs from most of the heads of the European states asking him to spare Maximilan. Upon Juárez's denial the brave woman answered, [...] "Oh, if blood must be spilled, then take my life, the life of a useless woman; and spare that of a man who can still do much good in other country." [...] Juarez did offer to spare the life of her husband, however, Maximilan would undergo a courts martial. [...] The scene was painted by the Mexican painter Manuel Ocaranza. vol.23 no.78 México mar./may. 2001.|$|E

[...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of."
