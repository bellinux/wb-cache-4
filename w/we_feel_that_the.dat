500|$|The {{second part}} of the season, which begins with episode 11, takes place three months after the events of episode 10. On the {{structure}} of the season and shifting the focus between the two parts, Bell stated it was the intent to follow the format from season two, by tying [...] "a whole bunch of [...] but not all of them off by the midseason. And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes {{of what it means to}} be human and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person? Is everybody capable of everything if put in a terrible position? Or is there true good and a true evil?" [...] The second half of the season sees the introduction of the comics' right-wing hate group the Watchdogs, depicted as radicals wishing to [...] "eliminate the Inhumans", as well as a [...] "cure" [...] that can prevent terrigenisis in yet-to-transition Inhumans.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the reports}} are hearsay in the {{technical}} sense, because their content is not produced live before the hearing examiner, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claimant and the Court of Appeals read too much into the single sentence from Consolidated Edison.

[...] This was not a blanket rejection by the Court of administrative [...] reliance on hearsay irrespective of reliability and probative value. The opposite was the case.|$|E
2500|$|Many theorists {{raised the}} issue that hedging and {{speculation}} were more of a spectrum than a distinct duality of goals. [...] "Academic studies (e.g. Bodnar et al, 1998) show that companies usually incorporate predictions of future price levels (i.e. a ‘view’) when executing hedges (a fact which will {{come as no surprise}} to most risk management practitioners). If hedging is really just about reducing risk, then why should our expectations of future market direction have any bearing on our hedging decisions? If we hedge 50% of our exposure, instead of 80% or 100%, because <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> price / rate of the underlying exposure is more likely to move in our favour, does this meet the criteria for speculation?...On one level (at the extremes), {{there is no doubt that}} hedging and speculation are very different activities. However, once you move beyond the straightforward elimination of open positions, into more nuanced transactions involving complex hedging strategies or tenuous relationships between hedges and exposures, the distinction between a hedge and a bet becomes increasingly vague." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § II. Now, {{as regards}} the second of these virtues, {{it is evident that}} we can {{establish}} no general laws. First, because it is not a virtue required in all buildings; there are some which are only for covert or defence, and from which we ask no conversation. Secondly, because there are countless methods of expression, some conventional, some natural: each conventional mode has its own alphabet, which evidently can be no subject of general laws. Every natural mode is instinctively employed and instinctively understood, wherever there is true feeling; and this instinct is above law. The choice of conventional methods depends on circumstances out of calculation, and that of natural methods on sensations out of control; so that we can only say that the choice is right, when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> means are effective; and we cannot always say that it is wrong when they are not so.|$|E

[...] It fastens the attention upon immortal necessary uncreated natures, that is, upon Ideas; and in their presence, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> outward circumstance is a dream and a shade. Whilst we wait in this Olympus of gods, we think of nature as an appendix to the soul. We ascend into their region, and know that these are the thoughts of the Supreme Being. [...] "These are they who were set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, they were there; when he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep. Then they were by him, as one brought up with him. Of them took he counsel." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} the colonies is such a change of circumstances, and that our present dispute is an exigency as {{pressing}} as any which ever demanded a revision of our government. Public troubles have often called upon this country to look into its Constitution. It has ever been bettered by such a revision. If our happy and luxuriant increase of dominion, and our diffused population, have outgrown the limits of a Constitution made for a contracted object, we ought to bless God, who has furnished us with this noble occasion for displaying our skill and beneficence in enlarging the scale of rational happiness, and of making the politic generosity of this kingdom as extensive as its fortune. If we set about this great work, on both sides, with the same conciliatory turn of mind, we may now, as in former times, owe even to our mutual mistakes, contentions, and animosities, the lasting concord, freedom, happiness, and glory of this empire.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be thought}} by some {{that in the}} pages which follow I have painted in too lurid colours the horrors of a foreign {{invasion}} of England. Realism in art, it may be argued, can be carried too far. I prefer {{to think that the}} majority of my readers will acquit me of a desire to be unduly sensational. It is necessary that England should be roused to a sense of her peril, and only by setting down without flinching the probable results of an invasion can this be done. This story, I may mention, has been written and published purely from a feeling of patriotism and duty. Mr. Alston Rivers' sensitive soul will be jarred to its foundations if it is a financial success. So will mine.

60|$|Many of them, as was but natural, died violent deaths, some by {{accident}} {{and a few}} by their own hands. No man of the first class ever died in the ring. The nearest approach to it was the singular and mournful fate which befell Simon Byrne, the brave Irishman, who had the misfortune to cause {{the death of his}} antagonist, Angus Mackay, and afterwards met his own end at the hands of Deaf Burke. Neither Byrne nor Mackay could, however, be said to be boxers of the very first rank. It certainly would appear, if we may argue from the prize-ring, that the human machine becomes more delicate and is more sensitive to jar or shock. In the early days a fatal end to a fight was exceedingly rare. Gradually such tragedies became rather more common, until now even with the gloves they have shocked us by their frequency, and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rude play of our forefathers is indeed too rough for a more highly organized generation. Still, it may help us to clear our minds of cant if we remember that within two or three years the hunting-field and the steeple-chase claim more victims than the prize-ring has done in two centuries.|$|E
6000|$|Range of {{intellectual}} power in Man.--First, {{let us consider}} what this wonderful instrument, the brain, is capable of in its higher developments. In Mr. Galton's interesting work on [...] "Hereditary Genius," [...] he remarks on the enormous difference between the intellectual power and grasp of the well-trained mathematician or man of science, and the average Englishman. The number of marks obtained by high wranglers, is often more than thirty times as great {{as that of the}} men {{at the bottom of the}} honour list, who are still of fair mathematical ability; and it is the opinion of skilled examiners, that even this does not represent the full difference {{of intellectual}} power. If, now, we descend to those savage tribes who only count to three or five, and who find it impossible to comprehend the addition of two and three without having the objects actually before them, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chasm between them and the good mathematician is so vast, that a thousand to one will probably not fully express it. Yet we know that the mass of brain might be nearly the same in both, or might not differ in a greater proportion than as 5 to 6; whence we may fairly infer that the savage possesses a brain capable, if cultivated and developed, of performing work of a kind and degree far beyond what he ever requires it to do.|$|E
