500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} towards New Guinea {{in early}} 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Jackson {{was promoted to}} acting squadron leader and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.75 Squadron on 19March, barely {{two weeks after the}} unit was formed at Townsville, Queensland. He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, who had led No.3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No.75 for operations at Port Moresby, where the local Australian Army garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers. Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, [...] "What are you fighting for? King and country? Well, I'm fighting for my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>kids</b> and no Jap bastard's going to get them!" [...] On 21March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome {{to take part in the}} defence of Port Moresby, a crucial early battle in the New Guinea campaign, and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called [...] "one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF". [...] The unit was equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks, whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed [...] "Tomorrowhawks", [...] "Neverhawks", and [...] "Mythhawks" [...] by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as [...] "Old John" [...] to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots, many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics, and fired their guns just once.|$|E
