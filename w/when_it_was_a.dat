5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity {{could be as high}} as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement.

The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9–10 February 2003 to 6.3million and 5.4million viewers respectively, and received mixed reactions from the audience: Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending, as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a Royal Television Society Award.|$|E

After the war {{it served as}} the command element for the 10th <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> training unit. Due to reorganizations in the Army, the Special Troops Battalion was not reactivated with the 10th Mountain Division in 1985, and instead remained inactive while the division served in numerous contingencies throughout the 1990s. Reactivated during another reorganization in 2004, the Special Troops Battalion supported the 10th Mountain Division command elements when they deployed to both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. During this service, it has received several commendations for its multiple deployments. In October 2009, the Special Troops Battalion was redesignated to Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry).|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Bronze Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon activity, {{including}} coins, jewellery and axes, {{has been}} discovered locally. The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> large estate which included neighbouring Cheadle. In the early 14th century it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle, respectively. The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Unlike many English villages it did not grow around a church; instead it formed from several hamlets, many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme. In the late 19th century Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle, Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a distinct place in its own right, {{as part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.|$|E
5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, {{it should be noted}} that this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E

5|$|The first {{documented}} {{reference to}} Warburton {{occurs in the}} Domesday Book, where the two manors of Warburton were recorded; the manors were united by the late 12th century. Before the Norman conquest, the area was controlled by the Anglo-Saxon thegn Aelfward. Although the Domesday Book records no church in Warburton, {{it is possible that}} the church dedicated to Saint Werburgh is pre-Conquest. The omission of the church may not be significant, as not all pre-Conquest churches or chapels were recorded in the Domesday survey. The first documented evidence of a church in Warburton was in a deed of 1187, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> chapel of ease for the parish of Lymm. Warburton became a separate parish in the 13th century. The church is surrounded by a ditch and bank, probably dating to at least the 14th century. Warburton is also the site of a medieval priory, near the Church of St Werburgh; although the priory was only formed in the 13th century, it was dissolved in 1270.|$|E
5|$|The street plan of {{the town}} still {{reflects}} the medieval layout of the town. Most shops lie along Fore Street with courts behind them linked by alleyways. The length of the high street reflects the prosperity of the town from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> centre of the cloth trade. The street plan is still fundamentally the same as shown on a map of 1663, with a wider area at the North end where markets were held, roads to Tiverton and Ponsford and a small lane leading down to a mill (now known as Lower Mill). This map has only two buildings with roofs coloured blue (conventionally meaning they were of slate) – St Andrew's church and the Walronds. There are two grade I listed buildings in Cullompton: the fifteenth century parish church (St Andrew's) and the Walronds at 6 Fore Street. There are also seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings. The {{centre of the town}} is a conservation area – {{the only one in the}} Mid Devon area. Hillersdon House, a Victorian manor house is near to the town centre and within the parish.|$|E
