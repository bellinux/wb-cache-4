25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. <b>We</b> <b>weather</b> proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E

40|$|After Brezhnev’s death, {{starting}} from 1983, there were troublesome times in Russia. At first the senile secretaries general came and passed away, making ‘a funeral parade’, and then Gorbachev’s perestroika started. The wind of change shook all foundations of usual mode of life. The economic {{collapse of the}} 1990 s brought in all forms of wild capitalism. The profession {{was not able to}} feed any more. Even recognized masters of architecture had to breed poultry in the country and return bottles to feed their families. But <b>we</b> <b>weathered</b> those bad times.

40|$|At the Australian Bureau of Meteorology weather {{statistics}} “are only calculated {{where it}} makes sense to do so” (BOM). This “sense” is directly related to human affairs and activities such as agriculture, fishery and recreation. This paper asks: are there other elements we can incorporate into the ways <b>we</b> think about <b>weather,</b> climates and seasons? What other possibilities exist if <b>we</b> consider <b>weather</b> and seasons that include non-human perspectives? What are the implications of these ways of thinking? In what follows, I draw upon Jane Bennett’s “vital materialism” to consider weather, climates and seasons as human and non-human assemblages of activity (Bennett). From this basis I put forward the notion that almanacs provide a medium for such practices to be realised...|$|R
