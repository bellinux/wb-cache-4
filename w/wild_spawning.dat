40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Evidence for reduced {{reproductive}} success (RS) of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> hatchery-reared fish invites serious consideration {{with regard to}} the detrimental effects on subsequent generations of wild populations. Mate choice was evaluated as a potential mechanism contributing to these observed RS differences using a previous pedigree of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> hatchery-reared and wild origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Genetic variance at immune-relevant genes was used as ametric toexaminematechoice. Twoyears (2005 and 2006) of threewild spawning mate pair classes were examined: wild x wild (W x W), hatchery x hatchery (H x H), and wild x hatchery (W x H). We tested for: (1) a departure from random expectations with regard to mate pair allelic diversity at immune-relevant markers, (2) a correlation between immune-relevant gene diversity and mate pair RS, and (3) distinguishable differences between mate choice strategies used by hatchery-reared and wild origin coho. Eight immune-relevant gene-linked microsatellite markers were used to evaluate mate choice; four linked to immune-relevant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and four linked to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). We found evidence for non-random mating between 2006 W x H mate pairs at BHMS 429,an MHC-linked marker, and at SsalR 016 TKU,an immune-relevantEST-linked marker, which was identified as a vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Non-random mating was also evident between 2005 H x H pairs at SsalR 015 TKU,an immune-relevantEST-linkedmarker,thoughno putativegene was identified. All other pair classes did not display a significant mate choice signature. We found a significant correlation between mate pair RS and immune gene diversity among 2005 and 2006 W x W mate pairs as well as 2006 W x H mate pairs. Notably, H x H mate pair RS was not correlated to immune gene diversity in either year. Results suggest that mate choice and genetic compatibility may influence fitness of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> coho...|$|E

40|$|Cod (Gadus morhua) {{aquaculture}} is {{a rapidly}} developing industry in coastal {{areas of the}} North Atlantic. Preventing escapes from sea cages has proved extremely difficult, and the close proximity of these cages to coastal cod populations means that interactions of escapees with wild stocks are inevitable. Very little is known, however, of how escapeeswill affect populations that are already over-exploited and at historical lows. Experience with salmon indicates that escapees may interbreed with wild stock causing genetic introgression and fitness depression in wild populations. Farmed escapees may also directly influence wild stocks by entering spawning shoals and disrupting the mating behaviour of wild fish. Substantial evidence indicates that the cod mating system is highly complex, involving both behavioural and acoustic courtship displays, and considerable vertical movement. Females are thought to attend male dominated aggregations when {{they are ready to}} spawn. The risks imposed by escapees may therefore depend on gender. As mating success of cod in the laboratory is highly skewed towards aggressive males, understanding behaviour at the individual level is also important. However, problems associated with elucidating the behaviour of individual cod in the field has, to date, limited our understanding of not only interactions between escapee and wild cod, but of cod spawning behaviour in general. In our study, we tested for genderbased differences in the behaviour of escapee and wild coastal cod on a spawning ground in Western Norway. Forty-eight individual cod were released {{at the start of the}} spawning season in 2007 and 3 -D fish movements in and around the spawning shoal were tracked with a stationary positioning system for 35 days. A subset of 8 fish was tagged with continuous transmitters for high-temporal resolution. Ongoing analysis is examining fish movements and behaviour in relation to water currents, surface light, salinity, temperature and sea-floor topography. Preliminary analysis indicates that while farmed cod may enter <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> shoals, there are significant gender-based differences in diel vertical movements of farmed and wild cod, and in other behavioural traits. These results are discussed in relation to possible effects of escapees on <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> shoals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —The {{percentage}} of hatchery-reared coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, increased from nearly 0 % {{in the early}} 1970 s to more than 70 % by 2001. These estimates were derived from fin clip and coded wire tag data collected from commercial and sport fisheries, research surveys conducted {{in the summer and}} fall of 1997 to 2000, and examination of the microstructure of otoliths extracted from juvenile coho salmon collected during our marine surveys. The increasing trend {{may be related to the}} proportions of hatchery and wild smolts entering saltwater, fishing rates, and changes in the ecological processes regulating coho salmon production in the ocean. The consequence for management is that the abundance of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> salmon (escapement) depends on hatchery as well as wild production. The consequence for policy makers is that future enhancement activities need to have clear policies for assessing the effects of hatchery fish on the population dynamics of wild fish as well as for producing hatchery fish.

Based on recovery patterns of freeze-branded juveniles released from June through August, 2000, mean estuarine residence time ranged from 8. 3 - 13. 8 d during June and July, and increased to an estimated 38. 3 d for fish marked and released in August.  Based on computer simulations of the process of estuarine entrance and exit, and on evidence of estuarine growth of juvenile Chinook salmon, it appears that these estimates of mean residence times were negatively biased. True mean residence times calculated in other studies may also be considerably longer than those estimated using existing published methods. Rowdy Creek Hatchery rears large numbers of chinook salmon and many are released as fingerlings into the Smith River estuary during May–June. In 1999, about 13 % of Rowdy Creek fingerlings were marked with a left maxillary clip, whereas in 2000 about 22 % of fingerlings were marked with an adipose fin clip and coded wire tag. Based on collection and examination of juvenile chinook salmon in the Smith River estuary, following release of these hatchery fish, it appears that the majority of chinook salmon juveniles are still produced by <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> fish rather than by Rowdy Creek Hatchery. Maximum estimated daily percentages of hatchery juveniles were 33 % in 1999 and 31 % during 2000. Within 30 days following releases in 1999 and 2000, the estimated percentages of hatchery fish present in the estuary had dropped to 15 % and 9 %, respectively. Together, these estimates of estuarine residence time and percentages of hatchery fish suggest that the Smith River estuary may be an important habitat for wild juvenile chinook salmon...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{exhibit a}} great {{variability}} in reproductive strategies. A particular mating system reported for some {{species of fish}} is the lek system. Studies on spawning behaviour of cod (Gadus, morhua) - a closely related species to haddock - {{have shown that the}} mating characteristics are consistent with lekking, meaning that cod are particularly vulnerable to disturbance by fishing on their spawning grounds. In this study the spawning behaviour of haddock, was examined and the prerequisites of lekking system were:'observed. Visual and acoustic displays ensured a clear area around a dominant male excluding less vigorous males and unripe females. Larger dominant males performed the solitary display for longer periods than smaller males, more during nights than days. Repeated female intrusions into the male's territory led to courtship and provided evidence that haddock mating is under female's control. Direct observations and DNA analysis demonstrated the existence of alternative male mating strategies. The ventral mount occurred generally outside the male territory. The acoustic repertoire of haddock, both during and outside spawning was described: sound unit structures and call duration were different and provided evidence of speci~s-specificsounds emitted by spawning males. The knocks emitted by each male during the solitary display had a constant waveform that differed from the knocks produced by the other individuals. Female and juvenile sounds were described for the first time. A simple mechanical model showed that a double pulsed sound waveform, could be obtained from two oscillators linked by a viscous-elastic spring, having opposite directions. A quadrupole motion of the haddock swimbladder was suggested. Detailed information about the haddock acoustic repertoire allowed us to detect for the first time haddock spawning grounds in the field (off Norway) by means of passive acoustic monitoring.

The ability to economically restock or enhance the species, while ensuring genetic diversity, would be improved if fertilised eggs could be collected from the <b>wild</b> during their <b>spawning</b> aggregations. This project developed effective techniques to collect snapper eggs from the extensively studied spawning aggregations in Cockburn Sound in Western Australia and to assess the genetic diversity of the offspring produced. Optimum weather conditions, times of day, methods and locations for egg collection were identified during the project. The selection of snapper eggs based on their diameter and oil globule size proved to be a reliable method of separating potential snapper from other eggs within the collections. Samples of these eggs were confirmed to be snapper using real-time PCR, comprising a snapper specific probe and a general fish probe. A microsatellite-based comparison of a sample of juveniles raised in the hatchery from <b>wild</b> <b>spawned</b> eggs with a sample of wild-caught individuals from Cockburn Sound tested the genetic integrity of this collection and culture method.

40|$|Experimental {{assessments}} of species vulnerabilities to ocean acidification are rapidly increasing in number, yet {{the potential for}} short- and long-term adaptation to high CO 2 by contemporary marine organisms remains poorly understood. We used a novel experimental approach that combined bi-weekly sampling of a <b>wild,</b> <b>spawning</b> fish population (Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia) with standardized offspring CO 2 exposure experiments and parallel pH monitoring of a coastal ecosystem. We assessed whether offspring produced {{at different times of}} the spawning season (April to July) would be similarly susceptible to elevated (1100 µatm, pHNIST = 7. 77) and high CO 2 levels (2300 µatm, pHNIST = 7. 47). Early in the season (April), high CO 2 levels significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced fish survival by 54 % (2012) and 33 % (2013) and reduced 1 to 10 d post-hatch growth by 17 % relative to ambient conditions. However, offspring from parents collected later in the season became increasingly CO 2 -tolerant until, by mid-May, offspring survival was equally high at all CO 2 levels. This interannually consistent plasticity coincided with the rapid annual pH decline in the species' spawning habitat (mean pH: 1 April/ 31 May = 8. 05 / 7. 67). It suggests that parents can condition their offspring to seasonally acidifying environments, either via changes in maternal provisioning and/or epigenetic transgenerational plasticity (TGP). TGP to increasing CO 2 has been shown in the laboratory but never before in a wild population. Our novel findings of direct CO 2 -related survival reductions in wild fish offspring and seasonally plastic responses imply that realistic {{assessments of}} species CO 2 -sensitivities must control for parental environments that are seasonally variable in coastal habitats...|$|E

40|$|Stocking {{with eggs}} {{has been widely}} used as a {{management}} measure to support degraded salmonid stocks. In Finland, Atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed spawning stocks. We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs {{in a study of}} 17 Finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including non-stocking years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0 -year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in non-stocking years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0 -year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40 %. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1. 0 and 3. 3 %, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> stocks and parr recruitment. Finally, we encourage fishery authorities to create clear management goals for threatened wild salmonid stocks. 201...|$|E

40|$|The public views salmon {{hatcheries}} as {{a lifeline}} for the species, {{at least in}} the Columbia Basin, which experienced near-exitinction due to damming of the Columbia River {{during the first half of}} the 20 th century. Jim Lichotowich 2 ̆ 7 s new book, 2 ̆ 2 Salmon, People, and Place 2 ̆ 2 : A Biologist 2 ̆ 7 s Search for Salmon Recovery, 2 ̆ 2 is an indictment of reliance on hatcheries as a mitigation measure for habitat loss, such as that caused by dams and land management prractices. Lichotowich, a respected salmon biologist, whose views have been sought by both governments and those who sue them, shows how hatcheries damage <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> salmon through competition for food and habitat, disease, genetic drift, and incentives to overharvest. In a very real sense, the fishery agencies charged with protecting wild runs of salmon have been captured by those who fund artificial mitigation measures in a misguided effort to maintain unsustainable sport and commercial harvest levels. Heavy reliance on hatcheries violates basic ecological principles first articulated over 60 years ago by the great wildlife scientist, Aldo Leopold. This book review applauds the effort to expose the false promise of salmon hatcheries but cautions that Lichotowich might be misinterpreted to suggest that the basic problem with salmon recovery lies with the fishery agencies and their attachment to hatcheries. Although the 2 ̆ 2 industrial model 2 ̆ 2 of salmon recovery Lichotowich despicts is certainly a large part of the reason why salmon recovery efforts have proved both so expensive and so ineffective, the principal cause of salmon habitat loss [...] {{at least in the}} Columbia Basin, home to the largest historic salmon runs in the Lower 48 [...] is dam construction and operation, mostly federal dams.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{dissertation}} is to quantify the efficiency and operation of various types of fish passes for dams. This is achieved through a novel experiment of testing juvenile salmon in a scale model fish-passes with a range of small structures including vertical slots, orifices, weirs and combinations of all three. Direct comparisons of the efficiency of each type of fish pass in terms of upstream migration. Two identical physical models were constructed, one at the Fisheries Research Services Freshwater Laboratory at Almondbank, Perth, Scotland where observations were made of fish behaviour. The other model at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow tested only hydraulic conditions. The physical models were simplified representations of a reach of a river downstream of a dam, weir or any other obstruction to fish migration. A removable cross wall incorporating one of the types of pass tested divided the flume into two pools. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged orifices or vertical slots than through weirs for a given flow rate and velocity. The orifice and vertical slot passing efficiencies are directly correlated to the velocities existing in their vicinity. To reach the weir/slot/orifice devices, salmon parr tended also to stay {{near the bottom of the}} flume and followed a path along the sides of the arena, which provided them with low velocities and cover. In the vicinity of the weir/orifice/slot devices, the movements of salmon parr were consistent with energy-conserving strategies. Clearly, the extrapolations of results from the behaviour of small to large salmon remains cautious, the intention of this research being to characterise the behaviour of small salmon and to develop clear testable hypotheses about how large salmon may respond to water flow. Preliminary field tests were then conducted at Tongland Dam fish pass to test the main recommendation extrapolated from the parr behavioural study. The particular situation of this fish pass, which contains both weirs and orifices, allows a comparison between the two. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags together with antennae installed at a weir and an orifice were used to individually monitor the movement of <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> salmon passing through the fish pass.

40|$|Restocking or stock {{enhancement}} {{programs have}} traditionally relied on captive broodstock to produce individuals for release into the wild. However, this is costly and may limit genetic {{diversity of the}} resulting progeny. If fertilised eggs could be collected from the wild and individuals reared for release, the genetic diversity of the released progeny may be improved and associated restocking/enhancement programs may become more cost-effective. Snapper (Chrysophrys auratus: Sparidae), is an iconic recreational and commercial fish species across Australia and New Zealand and {{has been subjected to}} overfishing in many locations. Enhancement programs may be useful for increasing biomass in some circumstances, but would require careful evaluation of advantages and disadvantages before commencement. This study developed and optimised egg collection methods for snapper from its <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> aggregations in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, and developed effective otolith marking techniques that would enable future monitoring of released individuals. The study identified the optimum sea conditions for collecting large numbers > 100, 000) of eggs using plankton nets, in addition to the need for side-scan sonar to locate spawning aggregations, the distance from aggregations at which to sample and the water depth for plankton net tows. Large numbers of eggs collected in 2014 and 2015 were subsampled and visually screened for presence of snapper eggs using known egg diameters. Real-time PCR techniques validated visual identifications of snapper eggs and larvae, limiting accidental rearing of non-target species and reducing associated costs. Trials on larvae reared from these eggs, successfully determined appropriate alizarin complexone concentrations and immersion times for producing enduring marks on post-larvae otoliths. These marks remained visible in otoliths after 12 months, potentially allowing future monitoring of fish released into the wild. Delayed disinfection of eggs to the second day after capture resulted in improved egg viability. Following optimisation of collection and culture techniques, 208, 000 larvae were stocked from a single sampling occasion in 2015, of which 19 % survived to 55. days post hatch (dph). This survival rate is typical for snapper produced from captive broodstock. This study demonstrated that wild spawned snapper eggs can be captured and cultured in high numbers and future identification of recaptured released fish potentially conducted. An associated genetic study also demonstrated no loss of genetic diversity in cultured fish versus that of adults in the spawning aggregations. This technique has the potential to reduce both the cost of restocking/stock enhancement programs for snapper (and could be evaluated for other suitable aggregating species) and the risks of altering the genetic makeup of wild stocks...|$|E

Underwater time-lapse videography is a passive methodology that does not trap or handle this Endangered Species Act listed species. Secesh River chinook salmon represent a <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> aggregate that has not been directly supplemented with hatchery fish. The Secesh River is also a control stream under the Idaho Salmon Supplementation study. This project has successfully demonstrated the application of underwater video monitoring to accurately quantify chinook salmon abundance in Lake Creek in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002. The adult salmon spawner escapement into Lake Creek in 2002 was 410 fish. Jack salmon comprised 7. 1 percent of the run. Estimated hatchery composition was 6. 1 percent of the spawning run. The first fish passage on Lake Creek was recorded on June 26, 15 days after installation of the fish counting station. Peak net upstream movement of 41 adults occurred on July 8. Peak of total movement activity was August 18. The last fish passed through the Lake Creek fish counting station on September 2. Snow pack in the drainage was 91 % of the average during the winter of 2001 / 2002. Video determined salmon spawner abundance was compared to redd count expansion method point estimates in Lake Creek in 2002. Expanded index area redd count and extensive area redd count point estimates in 2002, estimated from one percent fewer to 56 percent greater number of spawners than underwater video determined spawner abundance. Redd count expansion methods varied from two percent fewer to 55 percent greater in 2001, 11 to 46 percent fewer in 1999 and 104 to 214 percent greater in 1998. Redd count expansion values had unknown variation associated with the point estimates. Fish per redd numbers determined by video abundance and multiple pass redd counts of the larger extensive survey areas in Lake Creek have varied widely. In 2002 there were 2. 05 fish per redd. There were 2. 07 fish per redd in 2001, 3. 58 in 1999 and in 1998, with no jacks returning to spawn, there were 1. 02 fish per redd. Migrating salmon in Lake Creek exhibited two behaviorally distinct segments of fish movement in 2002. Mainly upstream only movement of both sexes characterized the first segment. The second segment consisted of upstream and downstream movement with less net upstream movement and appeared to correspond with the time of active spawning. The fish counting stations did not impede salmon movements, nor was spawning displaced downstream. Fish moved freely upstream and downstream through the fish counting structures. The downstream movement of salmon afforded by this fish counting station design may be an important factor in the reproductive success of listed salmon. This methodology provides more accurate salmon spawner abundance information than expansion of single-pass and multiple-pass redd counts.

Underwater time-lapse videography is a passive methodology that does not trap or handle this Endangered Species Act listed species. Secesh River chinook salmon represent a <b>wild</b> <b>spawning</b> aggregate that has not been directly supplemented with hatchery fish. The Secesh River is also a control population under the Idaho Salmon Supplementation study. This project has demonstrated the successful application of underwater video adult salmon abundance monitoring technology in Lake Creek in 1998 and 1999. Emphasis of the project in 2000 was to determine if the temporary fish counting station could be installed early enough to successfully estimate adult spring and summer chinook salmon abundance in the Secesh River (a larger stream). Snow pack in the drainage was 93 % of the average during the winter of 1999 / 2000, providing an opportunity to test the temporary count station structure. The temporary fish counting station was not the appropriate technology to determine adult salmon spawner abundance in the Secesh River. Due to its temporary nature it could not be installed early enough, due to high stream discharge, to capture the first upstream migrating salmon. A more permanent structure used with underwater video, or other technology needs to be utilized for accurate salmon escapement monitoring in the Secesh River. A minimum of 813 adult chinook salmon spawners migrated upstream past the Secesh River fish counting station to spawning areas in the Secesh River drainage. Of these fish, more than 324 migrated upstream into Lake Creek. The first upstream migrating adult chinook salmon passed the Secesh River and Lake Creek sites prior to operation of the fish counting stations on June 22. This was 17 and 19 days earlier than the first fish arrival at Lake Creek in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Peak net upstream adult movement at the Secesh River site occurred June 28 and at the Lake Creek site on June 27. Peak of total movement was August 16 at Secesh River and August 7 at Lake Creek. The last fish passed through the Lake Creek fish counting station on August 31 and on September 8 at the Secesh River site. Migrating salmon in the Secesh River and Lake Creek exhibited two behaviorally distinct segments of fish movement. The first segment of movement was characterized, mainly, by upstream movement only. The second segment consisted of upstream and downstream movement with very little net upstream movement. The fish counting stations did not impede salmon movements, nor was spawning displaced downstream. Fish moved freely upstream and downstream through the fish counting structures. Fish movement was greatest between the period of 5 : 00 p. m. and 4 : 00 a. m. There appeared to be a segment of ''nomadic'' males that moved {{into and out of the}} spawning area, apparently seeking other mates to spawn with. The downstream movement of salmon allowed by this fish counting station design may be an important factor affecting reproductive success as male salmon seek other females to spawn with. Traditional weirs operated for broodstock collection do not allow for downstream movement of adults. This methodology has the potential to provide more consistent and accurate salmon spawner abundance information than single-pass and multiple-pass spawning ground surveys. Accurate adult abundance would allow managers to determine if recovery actions were benefiting these salmon spawning aggregates and if recovery goals were being met...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture of {{the striped}} catfish, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage 1878), in Vietnam {{has become one}} of the fastest growing primary food {{production}} sectors in the world. Although a demand on quantity of fingerlings is currently reached, it is likely that the long term quality of the stocks may be uncertain due to lacking of genetic broodstock management measures. The present study employed five microsatellite loci to investigate levels of genetic variation of the stripped catfish of the current wild stocks as well as of the selected hatcheries in Vietnam. The study included four hatchery populations and two <b>wild</b> populations <b>spawned</b> in 2005 in the Mekong and Bassac Rivers, and one <b>wild</b> population (<b>spawned</b> in 2006) in the Bassac River. The results showed no genetic differentiation among populations as revealed by F ST and a model-based clustering method. AMOVA also showed no genetic differentiation between pooled wild and pooled hatchery populations while variation within groups was significant. Genetic variation of wild (mean number of alleles per locus, A = 4. 80 – 6. 20; allelic richness, A r = 4. 54 – 5. 06; mean effective number of alleles per locus, A e = 2. 86 – 3. 20; observed heterozygosity, H o = 0. 62 – 0. 65; expected heterozygosity, H e = 0. 62 – 0. 64) and hatchery populations (A = 4. 60 – 5. 20; A r = 4. 10 – 4. 83; A e = 2. 80 – 3. 11; H o = 0. 61 – 0. 66; H e = 0. 61 – 0. 64) were not statistically different. There were no evidences for recent genetic bottleneck in all populations. Therefore it is implied that the hatchery stocks of striped catfish in Vietnam were founded from sufficient numbers of brooders and current population size is large. The domestication process is in an early stage. </div...|$|R

40|$|Shelf area off {{the west}} coast of Hokkaido(Ishikari bay,Rumoi shelf and Teshio shelf) {{is one of the major}} {{seedling}} productions of scallop. However,since there have been no surveys of <b>wild</b> scallop,natural <b>spawning</b> ground maintaining the seedling production has not been resolved still now. To improve our understanding of immature scallop,a large number of larvae collected in the seedling production area were numerically backtracked to take into account the advection,which was roughly inferred from the analysis for mooring current,ADCP,GEK and hydrographic data. Northward flow mainly affected by the Tsushima Warm Current and estuarine flow from Ishikari River is characterized by intense shelf-edge flow and weak flow with a large periodical variation on the shelf. The model result suggested,at least,two major spawning grounds. One is somewhere about southern area outside of the shelf(south of Syakotan peninsula),and another is the southern end of Rumoi shelf where there may be spawning from scallop of the aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Anadromous {{fish populations}} in the Pacific Northwest have {{undergone}} substantial change throughout the past century. Historical periods of over-harvest {{and the construction of}} numerous dams throughout the region have contributed to declines in the runs of naturally spawning stocks. Management efforts to rebuild fish populations have focused on the restriction of harvest activities and the release of hatchery-reared salmon. A microcomputer simulation model is developed to estimate the economic impacts of management alternatives. In it, fish are passed throughout a network of nodes, according to parameters governing mortality and harvest. These parameters, and the node structure itself, are provided to the model by a user-specified input file. As a result, the model affords flexibility in meeting the modeling needs of differing salmonid stocks. The model's economic assessment capabilities are demonstrated through a case study of Rogue River spring chinook. Results of this exercise include estimates for the impacts of dam construction, hatchery releases, and changes in ocean and river harvest policies on the social value derived from harvest activities. The research also examines the redistribution of economic benefits associated with these policies. The impact of a recently constructed dam upon spring chinook fishermen is estimated at a loss of more than 10, 600, 000 over thirty years, given no hatchery supplementation. Current hatchery programs have mitigated the loss to fishermen, but whether they also offset their operating costs depends upon the particular harvest values employed. The value of providing an additional <b>wild</b> <b>spawner</b> to the basin is estimated to be roughly 300. Examination of various harvest alternatives indicates that restrictions placed on the commercial ocean fishery would be more successful in increasing the present value of harvests than would similar restrictions in the sport fishery. An important factor in this outcome is the higher value attributed to sport catch by currently accepted methods of valuation. Suggestions are made for improvements to the simulation model and the availability of information for use with it. Foremost among these is the need for improved specification of the marginal social value derived from salmon harvested in commercial and recreational fisheries...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. July 2012. Major: Integrated biosciences. Advisor: Dr. Thomas R. Hrabik. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 60 pages. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{were introduced to}} the Laurentian Great Lakes from the Pacific Coast and make up {{an important part of the}} sport fishery. The potamodromous life history variant (migratory rainbows or steelhead) is most prevalent among wild populations in the Great Lakes, where they hatch in-stream, migrate to the lake as juveniles, and return to the stream as adults to spawn. Large inter-annual variability in survival of steelhead populations from the Bois Brule River, WI, and Knife River, MN, in western Lake Superior has been observed, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well explained. The focus of my study was to identify the underlying mechanisms that influence variability in survival of <b>wild</b> maiden <b>spawning</b> adults. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify in-stream and in-lake (western Lake Superior) sources of variability, and to indicate the environment (stream or lake) that was most limiting. Data for <b>wild</b> maiden <b>spawning</b> rainbow trout, including abundance, stream age and lake age, were provided by the WI and MN Departments of Natural Resources. The in-stream analyses included stream temperature, flow, precipitation, and winter minimum air temperature. The lake analyses included surface temperature, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) (predator) abundance and forage abundance. For in-stream influences, I found that total September precipitation was negatively correlated with survival during the first stream year for Brule River steelhead. Total winter precipitation was positively correlated with survival of Knife River juveniles in their first stream year. However, first year survival of juvenile steelhead in the Knife River was negatively correlated with high stream temperatures (degree days > 20 °C). The number of Brule River first returning steelhead (maiden returns) was positively correlated with surface temperature in western Lake Superior in their first lake year. Maiden returns of Knife River steelhead were negatively correlated with cisco density (kg/ha) in their second lake year. Overall, my results suggest that variability in maiden returning steelhead for both populations is better explained by conditions in their river of origin than conditions in western Lake Superior, which have a secondary influence and may better explain variability in repeat spawning and stocked steelhead...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{seaweeds}} {{focused on}} the carrageenan-producing Kappaphycus alvarezii and the agar-producing Gracilaria spp. Growth of K. alvarezii was better on horizontal lines than on vertical or cluster lines from bamboo rafts. All morphotypes (brown green, and red) grew faster at 50 cm than at 100 cm below the water surface, but the green morphotype showed better carrageenan properties. A socioeconomic survey of K. alvarezii farming in Panagatan Cays, Antique revealed that a farmer has an average annual production of 3 tons/ha (dry) with the fixed bottom and hanging longline methods. Three species of Gracilaria in natural beds in lloilo showed monthly variations in biomass and agar quality; G. heteroclada had the highest biomass and gel strength. When this species was grown in tanks, growth and agar sulfate content were influenced by the interaction of light, salinity, and nutrients. Enriched and unenriched stocks of G. heteroclada differed in agar quality. When G. heteroclada was grown with the tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon in extensive ponds, the highest growth rate and production were obtained at the seaweed stocking density of 250 g/m 2; this was in November when average water temperature, transparency, and salinity were low. Salinity tolerance varies among Gracilaria species. Oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) and mussel (Perna viridis) farming in Western Visayas were assessed in 1992 {{in terms of the}} culture methods, socioeconomics, marketing, and profitability. A more localized survey of oyster and mussel fanning was conducted through rapid rural appraisal in two coastal towns in 1993. A farmer-participatory study followed in 1994 for the culture of oysters, mussels, seaweeds, and rabbitfishes in a river mouth in Dumangas, lloilo. Green mussel, brown mussel (Modiolus metcalfei), and seaweeds transplanted to Dumangas from Capiz have reproduced. In another study, the green mussel was tested as a biological filter in tiger shrimp ponds; shrimps stocked with mussels grew better than those without. A nationwide survey on the Placuna placenta fishery in 1993 showed 27 remaining 'kapis' beds; many others have been depleted due to excessive gathering, pollution, siltation, and trawling. Broodstocks are being developed to produce 'kapis' seed for grow-out and restocking.

Now that modern science has discovered some of the salmon`s secrets, their journey seems even more miraculous. So unlikely is the survival of a single returning salmon that Nature compensates heavily. Of the other 3, 000 to 7, 000 eggs in a nest, only one spawning pair, on average, will make it back.
