5|$|A {{total of}} 1,358 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since 1856 to 1,355 men. There are several {{statistics}} {{related to the}} greatest number of VCs awarded in individual battles or wars. The greatest number of Victoria Crosses won on a single day is 24, for deeds performed on 16 November 1857 in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny.

5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games <b>won</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season (41 wins) has stood {{for over a}} century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, {{or in any other}} sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 inches in 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E
