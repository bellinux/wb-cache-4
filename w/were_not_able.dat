Therefore, the analysis of the inability to resolve the word problem needs to be conducted to determine the students' problem-solving process in solving word problems. There are five steps in the Newman steps, namely: reading, comprehension, transformation, process skills, and encoding. This research is a descriptive qualitative research. The research was conducted on the students of class VIII-B SMP 25 Malang. The collection of data using a test and an interview. Analysis of qualitative data through 3 flow of data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion. The results showed that the inability of students in solving word problems in: (1) the reading step the students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to write down {{the meaning of the word}} exactly meaning of the word. (2) the stage of comprehension namely the students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to write components known and components asked in an exhaustive manner. (3) the transformation step that students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to determine the complete method, and students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to determine the appropriate method to be used in solving problems. (4) the process skills step that students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to compute correctly because students do calculations on the wrong method. (5) the encoding step the student <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to write down the answers to the right encoding, and students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to write the answer encoding with the appropriate unit...|$|R

The most serious fighting was on Camel Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German fire the Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of the Camel Beach landing zone the Allies <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>able</b> to succeed. A bombing run of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here.
