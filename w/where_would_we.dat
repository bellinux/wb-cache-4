In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] has been saying — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> be?

Lunn told McAullife that [...] "you can take the Queenslander out of Queensland, Ron, but you can't take the Queensland out of the Queenslander." [...] McAuliffe was initially sceptical.

5000|$|According to Derrida, he was {{inspired}} by the Cerisy study center to found this new institution, in the midst of governmental threats on the teaching of philosophy in the last class of high school. Thus was created this College, [...] "from a non-governmental origin, with an international span, an institution which is not destined to oppose itself, but to balance, question, open, occupy margins <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> privilege infrequent approaches or yet unlegitimized by the university approaches, new objects, new themes, new fields; <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> treat more of intersections than of academic disciplines".|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the tumultuous events, Madame Nhu {{appeared}} on NBC-TV's Meet the Press on 13 October 1963, defending her actions and those of the South Vietnamese government. [...] "I don't know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as ours is in Vietnam. Americans talk about my husband and I leaving our native land permanently. Why should we do this? <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> go? To say that 70 percent of my country's population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood." ...|$|E

60|$|And then I went to bed. The die was cast. I had staked my {{reputation}} as a navigator. Suppose, just suppose, that at daybreak there was no land. Then, where would my navigation be? And <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> be? And how would we ever find ourselves? or find any land? I caught ghastly visions of the Snark sailing for months through ocean solitudes and seeking vainly for land while we consumed our provisions and sat down with haggard faces to stare cannibalism in the face.|$|E

60|$|MRS WARREN [indignantly] Of course not. What sort {{of mother}} {{do you take}} me for! How could you keep your self-respect in such {{starvation}} and slavery? And whats a woman worth? whats life worth? without self-respect! Why am I independent and able to give my daughter a first-rate education, when other women that had just as good opportunities are in the gutter? Because I always knew how to respect myself and control myself. Why is Liz looked up to in a cathedral town? The same reason. <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> be now if we'd minded the clergyman's foolishness? Scrubbing floors for one and sixpence a day and nothing {{to look forward to}} but the workhouse infirmary. Don't you be led astray by people who don't know the world, my girl. The only way for a woman to provide for herself decently is for her to be good to some man that can afford to be good to her. If she's in his own station of life, let her make him marry her; but if she's far beneath him she can't expect it: why should she? it wouldn't be for her own happiness. Ask any lady in London society that has daughters; and she'll tell you the same, except that I tell you straight and she'll tell you crooked. Thats all the difference.|$|E
6000|$|Meserve {{seemed to}} heed {{nothing but the}} lamp [...] Or {{something}} not far from it on the table.

It needs the wind's help. [...] But the wind didn't move it if it moved. [...] It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here. [...] It couldn't stir so sensitively poised [...] A thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp [...] To get a puff of black smoke from the flame, [...] Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat. [...] You make a little foursquare block of air, [...] Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all [...] The illimitable dark and cold and storm, [...] And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog, [...] And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose; [...] Though for all anyone can tell, repose [...] May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it. [...] So false it is that what we haven't we can't give; [...] So false, that what we always say is true. [...] I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will. [...] It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?" ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{will then}} {{give a speech}} about the greatness of Britain. During this segment, Al will say {{something}} along the lines of 'You see, Britain is all about rules.
