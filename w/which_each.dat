5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting vertex. A graph is connected if every vertex or edge is reachable from every other vertex or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in <b>which</b> <b>each</b> vertex is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia in <b>which</b> <b>each</b> swimming {{style is}} associated with a vivid experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was {{initially}} composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on 1September 1939.

5|$|Computer {{architectures}} in <b>which</b> <b>each</b> {{element of}} main memory {{can be accessed}} with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems.

A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
