[...] He confirmed that [...] "the Iraq stuff and the Vietnam stuff is there by design", adding that he did not think that the film was anti-military. [...] Critic Charles Marowitz in Swans magazine remarked, however, that the realism of the suggested parallel with wars in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan [...] "doesn't quite jell" [...] because the natives are [...] "peace-loving and empathetic".|$|E

Amnesty International protested the arrests of both men, noting Jigme Gyatso {{to be at}} risk of further torture and naming Dhondup Wangchen a prisoner of conscience. Human Rights Watch, Front Line, The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy also advocated on Dhondup Wangchen's behalf. Blogging from under house arrest in Beijing, Tsering Woeser wrote in 2010, [...] "In fact, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> {{in a country where the}} spiritual has already been undermined, when someone like Dhondup Wangchen who has been the conscience of mankind is consigned to a dark prison, I am afraid the future of this country will sink into hatred and brutality." ...|$|E

She said of the episode, [...] "The 'South Park' episode of last weekend was not just funny, and it wasn't just witty. [...] addressed an essential piece in the times that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living.</b> There is one group of people, one religion that is claiming to be above criticism."

500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects {{things that are going on}} currently in this privileged world that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world. I think that's something definitely for us to reinvestigate and that we continue to make choices for our own future to take that into consideration". Howard focused on Kate [...] "being accustomed to fear and loss" [...] because the character was a military brat.|$|E

500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|Masters and Johnson's research, {{as well as}} Shere Hite's, {{generally}} supported Kinsey's {{findings about}} the female orgasm. Masters and Johnson were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. They observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms have the same stages of physical response, {{and found that the}} majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On that basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood. The research came {{at the time of the}} second-wave feminist movement, which inspired feminists to reject the distinction made between clitoral and vaginal orgasms. Feminist Anne Koedt argued that because men [...] "have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina" [...] and not the clitoral area, this is why women's biology had not been properly analyzed. [...] "Today, with extensive knowledge of anatomy, with , Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson, to mention just a few sources, there is no ignorance on the subject ," [...] she stated in her 1970 article The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm. She added, [...] "There are, however, social reasons why this knowledge has not been popularized. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in a male society which has not sought change in women's role." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of [...] "world ages" [...] in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in the fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b'ak'tuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's [...] "zero date" [...] was set {{at a point in}} the past marking {{the end of the third}} world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b'ak'tun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that [...] "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya." [...] In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that [...] "there is a suggestion... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [...] Thus... our present universe [...] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion." ...|$|E

It was not a clear vision, however, and there were two phases of it, somewhat jumbled at the time. It struck me, from watching those with whom I associated, that the life <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>was</b> more destructive than that lived by the average man.|$|R

2500|$|Epistemologically, {{it is not}} {{impossible}} to tell whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: [...] "You {{are living in a}} simulation. Click here for more information." [...] However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.|$|E

But, ironically, Leavitt later turned against the Mayor and his lieutenants after his discovery of corruption {{at the highest levels}} of San Francisco's City Hall, which Leavitt later helped expose. The city's mayor was convicted in the investigation that followed, and the entire Board of Supervisors resigned in the wake of the scandal. [...] "We have dreamed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> under the government of laws," [...] Leavitt wrote following the attempted assassination of Assistant San Francisco District Attorney Heney, who was investigating corruption Leavitt helped uncover, [...] "whereas <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> under the government of newspapers hired by corrupt corporations, and the enemies of civic decency." ...|$|R

[...] "Order and purpose are replaced by chaos and bewilderment.

2500|$|Rabbi Yitzchak of Akko {{then goes}} on to explain a value of 49,000 years, but does not proceed with the multiplication, nor the {{reduction}} of 49,0000 to 42,000, which is Kaplan's own interpretation. Kaplan calculates {{the age of the universe}} to be 15,340,500,000 years old. His reasoning was as follows: as the Midrash states, [...] "A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday" [...] (Psalm 90:4); a physical year contains 365 ¼ days, which, if multiplied by 1000 would give the length of a divine year as 365,250 physical years; if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>living</b> in the last, 7th Sabbatical cycle, that would mean that the creation as it described in the Bible happened 42,000 divine years ago; to convert this figure to physical years it should be multiplied by 365,250; this gives the result 15,340,500,000 years.|$|E
