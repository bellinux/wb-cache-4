5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} when these birds spend much of their time foraging <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E

Louis tried to flee the site of the battle but slipped from his frightened horse and drowned. Mary would mourn him {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> human race.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{was laid}} {{down at the}} New York Navy Yard on 9 March 1909. She was {{launched}} on 12 May 1910, and commissioned into the US Navy on 15 September 1911. She spent {{the next several months}} on training cruises in the Caribbean and off Maine, after which she moved to Hampton Roads to join the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived on 29 March 1912, and was made the flagship of the 1st Battleship Division (BatDiv). For the next two years, she participated in the normal routine of peacetime exercises with her division and squadron and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Atlantic Fleet. She also conducted extensive gunnery training and took midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on midshipman training cruises.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> foot {{in contact with}} the ground (plantigrade), {{in a manner similar to}} many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Helms {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jimmy Wang Yang over the Cruiserweight Title, after a tag team match in which Matt Hardy and Yang {{defeated}} Helms and Sylvan. The feud ended after Helms defeated him to retain the title at Armageddon in December 2006. In 2007, Helms once again feuded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Cruiserweight division on SmackDown!. During this feud, Helms' reign as Cruiserweight Champion {{came to an end}} at No Way Out, when he was unable to win a Cruiserweight open invitational, which saw Chavo Guerrero win the championship. Shortly after losing the championship, Helms formed a tag team with Guerrero, but they did not win any matches as a team.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> NKPA.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the British {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans, and in 192223 Tubas {{was incorporated into}} the British Mandate of Palestine. In 1947, the United Nations drew up a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were {{to be included in}} the Arab state. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Fawzi al-Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army (ALA) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there; Tubas would serve as the ALA's headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war. Transjordan (became Jordan in April 1949) annexed the city along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> West Bank, after gaining control of it during the war. In 1955 the first girls' school was opened. Tubas was under their control until 1967, when Israel occupied the West Bank during the Six-Day War.|$|E
