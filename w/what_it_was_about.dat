Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be [...] "all about [...] " [...] because the song's message was universal; [...] "almost every girl in America could say they hate their ex or current boyfriend," [...] claimed Cyrus. As a result, the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz, Liana Liberato, and Maiara Walsh. During the planning session, Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her, such as photographs and his dirty socks, which she had stowed away beneath her bed. They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video. For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's medical identification tag, which he received because of his diabetes mellitus.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's profile {{continued}} to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack– a lonely limousine driver looking for love– after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that [...] "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> as I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as [...] "heavy handed" [...] and [...] "predictable", but [...] "intriguing and at least partially successful".|$|E
500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about.</b> An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you always tell an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E

Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress {{in front of a}} fire. Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News remarked that she [...] "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." [...] Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. Mandler sought to create a [...] "wider landscape" [...] by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: [...] "hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when you wake up from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> it was about something else." [...] He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: [...] "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, or is she in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." [...] On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on MTV's official website. It featured Rihanna in a [...] "leopard-print" [...] robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. The music video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] premiered November 8 on MTV.

The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written {{a quarter of a}} century ago, a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and Lady Chatterley's Lover."

[...] They also wondered whether any previous generations had acted along similar lines, and their research discussed historical analogues to the current generations. [...] The two ultimately described a recurring pattern in Anglo-American history of four generational types, each with a distinct collective persona, and a corresponding cycle of four different types of era, each with a distinct mood. The groundwork for this theory was laid out in Generations in 1991. [...] Strauss and Howe expanded on their theory and updated the terminology in The Fourth Turning in 1997. Generations helped popularize the idea that people in a particular age group tend to share a distinct set of beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors because they all grow up and come of age during a particular period in history.|$|E

2500|$|His dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange was {{published}} in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the Second World War in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted and violated by deserters from the US Army in London during the blackout. The event {{may have contributed to}} her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young anti-hero, Alex, captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of aversion therapy treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book Flame into Being (1985) Burgess described A Clockwork Orange as [...] "a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence." [...] He added [...] "the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about,</b> and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die." [...] Near the time of publication the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book. Burgess had written A Clockwork Orange with twenty-one chapters, meaning to match the age of majority. [...] "21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility," [...] Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was [...] "being charitable in accepting the work at all," [...] Burgess accepted the deal and allowed A Clockwork Orange to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter.|$|E
