Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who could see {{troubles}} ahead {{after the death of}} Muawiyah and was opposed to the appointment of Yazid, later said of Muawiyah: [...] "Truly the son of Hind deployed a dexterity and mental resourcefulness as one will never see after him. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> impose something on him, an irritated lion with claws unsheathed would not show more audacity than him. He knew when to give into us, to even allow himself to be tricked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do that to him. He was the most artful of men, more crafty than a thief. I wished that we would never lose him, just as a rock remaining on this summit" [...] pointing to the mountain of Abu Qubays outside Mekka.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{take it out of}} that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a little bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{the first}} gray of dawn we left our house of pain, and outside, found {{ourselves}} in a mist, dense and chill. We stumbled on till {{we came to the}} railroad track. I was going back to Omaha to throw my feet for breakfast; my companion was going on to Chicago. The moment for parting had come. Our palsied hands went out to each other. We were both shivering. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> speak, our teeth chattered us back into silence. We stood alone, shut off from the world; all that we could see was a short length of railroad track, both ends of which were lost in the driving mist.

60|$|And then Ace sank {{suddenly}} into thick mud to his belly, and Ajor and I {{were thrown}} far over his head. He {{had run into}} one of those numerous springs which cover Caspak. Sometimes they are little lakes, again but tiny pools, and often mere quagmires of mud, as was this one overgrown with lush grasses which effectually hid its treacherous identity. It is a wonder that Ace did not break a leg, so fast he was going when he fell; but he didn't, though with four good legs he was unable to wallow from the mire. Ajor and I had sprawled face down in the covering grasses and so had not sunk deeply; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> rise, we found that there was not footing, and presently we saw that Du-seen and his followers were coming down upon us.

I've read or heard somewhere, sir, about God's goodness in tempering the wind to the shorn lamb. I don't know who said that first; but it might well have been spoken on account of my own darling little Mary, in those days. Instead of us being the first to comfort her, it was she that was first to comfort us. And so she's gone on ever since--bless her heart! Only treat her kindly, and, in spite of her misfortune, she's the merriest, happiest little thing--the easiest pleased and amused, I do believe, that ever lived.|$|E
6000|$|We confessed shyly to {{one another}} a common secret vice, [...] "Phantom warfare." [...] When we walked alone, {{especially}} in the country, we had both developed the same practice of fighting an imaginary battle about us as we walked. As we went along we were generals, and our attacks pushed along on either side, crouching and gathering behind hedges, cresting ridges, occupying copses, rushing open spaces, fighting from house to house. The hillsides about Penge were honeycombed in my imagination with the pits and trenches I had created to check a victorious invader coming out of Surrey. For him West Kensington was chiefly important as {{the scene of a}} desperate and successful last stand of insurrectionary troops (who had seized the Navy, the Bank and other advantages) against a royalist army--reinforced by Germans--advancing for reasons best known to themselves by way of Harrow and Ealing. It is a secret and solitary game, as we found <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> play it together. We made a success of that only once. All the way down to Margate we schemed defences and assailed and fought them as we came back against the sunset.
