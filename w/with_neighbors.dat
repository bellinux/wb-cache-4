Due to storm damage, the Red Cross in North Korea distributed over 2.1million water purification tablets and over 11,000water containers. The agency also provided 32,753blankets and 4,931kitchen units. After the storm, people left homeless by the storm sought shelter <b>with</b> <b>neighbors</b> or in shelters. A South Korean dairy company donated 42,000cans of baby formula to North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Portugal, the immediate focus of Brazil's foreign policy was to gain widespread international recognition. The first nation to recognize Brazilian sovereignty was the United States, in May 1825. Other nations followed in establishing diplomatic relations {{over the next}} few years. Portugal recognized the separation in August 1825. The Brazilian government subsequently made it a priority to establish its international borders through treaties with its neighbors. The task of securing recognized frontiers was complicated by the fact that, between 1777 and 1801, Portugal and Spain had annulled their previous treaties setting out the borders between their American colonial empires. However, the Empire was able to sign several bilateral treaties <b>with</b> <b>neighbors,</b> including Uruguay (in 1851), Peru (in 1851 and 1874), the Republic of New Granada (later Colombia, in 1853), Venezuela (in 1859), Bolivia (in 1867) and Paraguay (in 1872). By 1889, most of its borders were firmly established. The remaining issues—including the purchase of the region of Acre from Bolivia which would give Brazil its present-day configuration—were only finally resolved after the country became a republic.|$|E

Today, the city maintains a housing assistance office that works with home buyers to achieve and maintain neighborhood integration.|$|E
25|$|Besides slaves, {{there were}} a number of free people of color in the state. Most were descended from free African Americans who had {{migrated}} along <b>with</b> <b>neighbors</b> from Virginia during the 18th century. The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free. After the Revolution, Quakers and Mennonites worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for manumission of their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Such {{violence}} did {{not enter}} the region until the invasion of tribes following the Kurgan Culture in the fourth millennium BC. Until {{the invasion of the}} Kurgan peoples, the region was an agrarian society, settled and content, with no reason for the populations to become violent with one another. The invasion uprooted the sedentary tribes, and caused chaos in the area. The LBK entered an unsettled “dark age” of disunity. Violence in the area came {{as a result of this}} chaos, because unsettled tribes became belligerent as they competed <b>with</b> <b>neighbors.</b> All of this occurred hundreds of years after the death of the 34 humans at Talheim.|$|E

The war party <b>with</b> <b>Neighbors,</b> who felt this was no time to decline, went to Mexico, where Neighbors attempted to buy beef on credit to feed the warriors. When the Mexicans declined to sell beef to a Republic of Texas official on credit, Old Owl told them two beeves were to be forthcoming immediately, or the hacienda would be burned down and every living being killed. This proved highly effective, and the food was immediately forthcoming.|$|E

This gang has many rivals including both the devious hoodlums and the la colonia gang. In March 2009, a couple members of this gang snuck onto the Magnolia High School campus and stabbed {{a member of the}} La Colonia gang. Although most of the local street gangs in this area are of Mexican or Hispanic heritage, there is also an African American gang known as the Del Monte Blocc Gangster Crips Gang. This violent gang in West Anaheim claims most of Lincoln Avenue as their territory. This gang counts most of the other Hispanic gangs as their rivals. as a result, members of this gang have been known to harass or assault Mexican youth who look like rival gang members or are found hanging out in their territory.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally opened it to traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With this extraordinary increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the ability to go and see a show while also connecting <b>with</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before 1800, most cloth {{was made}} in home workshops, and housewives sewed it into {{clothing}} for family use or trade <b>with</b> <b>neighbors.</b> In 1810 {{the secretary of the}} treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including hosiery and linen, was produced by households. By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores. The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. Samuel Slater secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and build new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs. By the time the Embargo Act of 1807 cut off trade with Britain, there here were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used Arckwright water frames powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England. In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the putting-out system of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 Francis Cabot Lowell of the Boston Manufacturing Company built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of 1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.|$|E

500|$|Some species form {{aggregates}} or filaments {{of cells}} up to 200μm long. These organisms can be prominent in biofilms. Notably, aggregates of Thermococcus coalescens cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells.

The function of these cannulae is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange <b>with</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Multi-species colonies exist, such as the [...] "string-of-pearls" [...] community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp.
