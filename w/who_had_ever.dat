5|$|After Denard Robinson {{left for}} the NFL, sophomore Russell Bellomy, the only {{scholarship}} quarterback on the roster other than Devin Gardner, endured a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. The injury left the team without a healthy backup <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> taken an official snap. True freshman Morris competed with redshirt freshman walk-on Brian Cleary for the backup role. On August 22, 2013 as a true freshman, Morris was named backup quarterback to redshirt junior Gardner. He made his debut for the 2013 team in the season opener against Central Michigan. Passing for 59 yards on 4-for-6 passing, {{he was one of}} 11 true freshmen to play in the game for Michigan. Morris also played in the Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry on November 2 against the 2013 Michigan State Spartans, completing only one pass (on three attempts) for six yards. Gardner suffered a turf toe injury prior to the 2013 team's 2013 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl against Kansas State. With Gardner held out of practices, Morris got extensive work. Morris started in place of Gardner in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, compiling 196 yards on 2438 passing.|$|E

25|$|Peter Canavan's {{contribution}} to the game was marvelled throughout the country. He started the match, and was taken off before half time.

25|$|After the break-up, most of {{the past}} and present members of Deep Purple went on to have {{considerable}} success {{in a number of other}} bands, including Gillan, Whitesnake and Rainbow. There were, however, a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.|$|E
25|$|The first {{critical}} step... was {{the registration}} of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin. The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males, white and black, except those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> sworn {{an oath to}} uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion... Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently, barring from registration not only all pre-1861 officials {{of state and local}} governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries. In May Griffin... appointed a three-man board of registrars for each county, making his choices on the advice of known scalawags and local Freedmen's Bureau agents. In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars... Final registration amounted to approximately 59,633 whites and 49,479 blacks. It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register (estimates vary from 7,500 to 12,000), but blacks, who constituted only about 30 percent of the state's population, were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraceptives}} {{may produce}} {{a slight increase}} in {{the risk of breast cancer}} diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a relative risk (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current combined oral contraceptive pill users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection. The relative risk of breast cancer diagnosis associated with current and recent use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to vary with family history of breast cancer. Some studies have suggested that women who began using hormonal contraceptives before the age of 20 or before their first full-term pregnancy are at increased risk for breast cancer, but it is not clear how much of the risk stems from early age at first use, and how much stems from use before the first full-term pregnancy.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{reviewed}} positively {{by both the}} audience and professional reviewers. The Audience Appreciation Index score was 91: an unprecedented figure for Doctor Who {{and one of the}} highest ratings ever given to a television programme. On its original broadcast, it was viewed by 8.78million viewers and was the second most-watched programme of the week; at the time of broadcast, it was the highest position Doctor <b>Who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> reached. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive: Nicholas Briggs and Julian Bleach were commended for their portrayal of Dalek Caan and Davros respectively; and most aspects of Davies' writing were applauded: most notably, the twist ending of the episode was universally appreciated. The shock regeneration created an unprecedented level of public interest in the show, which continued until the transmission of [...] "Journey's End".|$|E

50|$|Now, if {{we assume}} that the number of humans who will ever be born equals N1, the {{probability}} that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived is of course 100%. However, if the number of humans who will ever be born equals N2, then the probability that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived is only 1%. Since X is in fact amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived, this means that the total number of humans who will ever be born {{is more likely to be}} much closer to 60 billion than to 6,000 billion.

Among readers of Doctor Who Magazine, the episode was voted the second-best story of the fourth series, behind [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End", with an average rating of 8.81/10; and the episode was the fourth best-received episode of the fourth series {{among members of the}} Doctor Who Forum, with an approval rating of 88.0%.|$|E
500|$|Wisden's {{obituary}} described Hammond {{as one of}} the {{top four}} batsmen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> played, calling him [...] "a most exciting cricketer. ... The instant he walked out of a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred." [...] Throughout the 1930s, the public and critics regarded Hammond as England's best batsman, succeeding Jack Hobbs, and next to Bradman, the best in the world (although George Headley also had a claim). Among English batsmen, only Herbert Sutcliffe, with a higher Test average, was similarly successful. According to Alan Gibson, however, although Sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis, [...] "his batting never gave quite the same sense of majesty and excitement that Hammond's did".
