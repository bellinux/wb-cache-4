5|$|When Borah went to <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were supposed to have shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to be motivated by racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E

5|$|Sherman was renominated for Congress in 1860 and {{was active}} in Abraham Lincoln's {{campaign}} for President, giving speeches on his behalf in several states. Both were elected, with Sherman defeating his opponent, Barnabas Burns, by 2,864 votes. He returned to <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lame duck session of the 36th Congress. By February 1861, seven states had reacted to Lincoln's election by seceding from the Union. In response, Congress passed a constitutional amendment proposed by Representative Thomas Corwin of Ohio. Known today as the Corwin Amendment, it {{was an attempt to}} forge a compromise to keep the remaining slave states in the Union and entice the seceded states to return. Corwin's legislation would have preserved the status quo on slavery and prohibited any future amendment granting Congress power to interfere with slavery in the states. Sherman voted for the amendment, which passed both houses of Congress and was sent to the states for ratification. Few states ratified it, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, outlawing slavery, rendered the compromise measure moot.|$|E
