40|$|Abstract—The {{tangent plane}} {{algorithm}} for real time recurrent learning (TPA-RTRL) {{is an effective}} online training method for fully recurrent neural networks. TPA-RTRL uses the method of approaching tangent planes to accelerate the learning processes. Compared to the original gradient descent real time recurrent learning algorithm (GD-RTRL) it is very fast and avoids problems like local minima of the search space. However, the TPA-RTRL algorithm actively encourages the formation of large weight values that can be harmful to generalization.
