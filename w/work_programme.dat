Drawing on recent survey data from two public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> in South Africa, the microeconomic impacts of public <b>works</b> <b>programme</b> participation in terms of income poverty, non income poverty and labour market performance are reviewed. These microeconomic findings are then linked to recent research examining the macro-economic impacts of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> and the two are considered together in order to assess the micro-macro linkage of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> and their contribution to development and poverty reduction.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Trends {{in policy}} {{the world over}} have seen {{priority}} given to price stability and the strengthening economic growth, with these measures perceived to provide the conditions for creating jobs and driving an economic towards full employment. However, economies the world over remain far from full employment. This thesis uses evidence-based approaches to assess labour market programmes in Indonesia {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of how employment policies support the functioning of labour markets. One particular employment policy is closely examined, namely, public <b>works</b> <b>programmes.</b> Public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> have been criticized in the literature due to poor targeting, political corruption, the creation of low quality assets, and mismatches between programme specification and the labour market situation. However, these programmes remain relatively popular among policy makers and the general public due to their combination of job creation and infrastructure investment. Public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> can be thought of as targeted interventions that typically provide wages at fixed prices in line with the market minimum and attract labour from the back of the unemployment queue, therefore hiring "off the bottom" while providing an "on the spot" approach to creating jobs. Public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> therefore form a strategic pillar of employment policy. Indonesia has a long history of implementing public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> in various forms and these programmes have been instrumental in creating jobs, supporting crisis recovering and stimulating local economic development. Many models exist and it is important to take lessons from these models in order to support the overall development of such programmes. In Indonesia, there is a strong relationship between economic growth and employment outcomes. There are also a number of challenges within the labour market, including labour market churning and a high prevalence of vulnerable employment. The situation points to a need for the strengthening of labour market institutions, programmes and services. Policies are designed to change and/or improve outcomes. In this regard, it is crucial to understand how changes can be attributed towards policy interventions through a range of evidence-based approaches, particularly through evaluations that provide information on impact and efficiency. This thesis does this for public <b>works</b> <b>programmes.</b> Core research questions that this thesis explores relate to whether public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> are a suitable employment policy given the Indonesian context. Programme effectiveness is examined through case studies that consider the wage income transfer and the role of the assets created. The research undertaken highlights how evidence-based approaches can be used to strengthen policy performance. Three methods were selected for examining public <b>works</b> <b>programmes,</b> including i) a programme assessment which provides a useful framework for understanding process-oriented aspects of programme execution, ii) a survey of beneficiaries of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes,</b> and iii) a baseline and post implementation survey of a public <b>works</b> <b>programme</b> located in a rural remote area of Indonesia. This combination of assessment methodologies allowed for a systematic, yet nuanced assessment of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes.</b> The major conclusions that can be drawn from the research undertaken in this thesis include that public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> in Indonesia have been inclusive of vulnerable groups and successful in supporting employment creation and local economic development. This thesis fills a gap in the literature by providing i) a thorough examination of the process-oriented features of public works programmes; ii) an understanding of who the beneficiaries of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> are in Indonesia, and iii) an empirically founded analysis on the impacts of the asset provision component of public <b>works</b> <b>programmes.</b> In total, this thesis demonstrates that public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> in Indonesia have been worthwhile, but that an expansion of such programmes should be accompanied by a number of reforms in order to optimize the efficiency of public spending...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2008. This {{research}} measures and evaluates {{the impact of}} the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programmes</b> on job creation in the Zululand District in order to guide government in developing a policy that will assist future job creation programmes. The Provincial government has prioritized poverty reduction and job creation as key focus areas in Kwazulu - Natal. This study attempts to determine whether the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> contributes towards job creation and economic growth. The study was limited to the area of the Zululand District Municipality. This research was quantitative in nature {{in order to meet the}} objectives of the study which relates to impacts of the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> on job creation. Statistics will be used to justify the conclusions drawn about the percentage increase in employment creation in the area.. The sample was a representative of the population of the area under study. Efforts were made to eliminate any ambiguity in the questionnaires. As training of people on the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> is often conducted in less than six months and as the training is often not accredited, it is concluded that the jobs created by the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> in the Zululand District Municipality are not sustainable. A high percentage of people worked on the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> projects. Although these jobs are not sustainable, they do contribute towards the reduction of unemployment during the construction phase of the project. Most people agree with and support the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> as a successful programme that gives hope for job creationThe output and impact of the Expanded Public <b>Works</b> <b>Programme</b> on skills training, monthly gross household income, daily wage, sustainable jobs and reduction in unemployment is shown to be minimal or not having a very noticeable impact [...] Registered institutions under the Department of Education should be used to conduct training on these projects so that the level of training received can be consistent for all people traine...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the extent}} to which public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> – a subset of social protection initiatives – can better promote gender equity in the rural economy. The paper draws on empirical research carried out in Ethiopia and India on two national flagship public <b>works</b> <b>programmes.</b> We find that to date gender equality objectives have mostly only been incorporated into public <b>works</b> <b>programmes</b> as secondary goals, despite the evidence on the gendered nature of rural poverty and vulnerability. Where programmes are cognisant of such inequalities – for example, life‐cycle vulnerabilities, constraints to access productive resources and unequal divisions of labour in the household, programmes can better support the positive impacts and reduce gendered inequalities. Relatively simple design changes combined with an investment in more strategic implementation practices and capacity strengthening initiatives are needed to enhance the potential of public <b>works</b> <b>programme</b> to contribute to a transformation of gender relations to support more equitable opportunities for women in the rural economy...|$|R

25|$|The WTO is {{attempting}} to complete negotiations on the Doha Development Round, which was launched in 2001 with an explicit focus on developing countries. , {{the future of the}} Doha Round remained uncertain: the <b>work</b> <b>programme</b> lists 21 subjects in which the original deadline of 1 January 2005 was missed, and the round is still incomplete. The conflict between free trade on industrial goods and services but retention of protectionism on farm subsidies to domestic agricultural sector (requested by developed countries) and the substantiation of fair trade on agricultural products (requested by developing countries) remain the major obstacles. This impasse has made it impossible to launch new WTO negotiations beyond the Doha Development Round. As a result, there have been an increasing number of bilateral free trade agreements between governments. As of July 2012, there were various negotiation groups in the WTO system for the current agricultural trade negotiation which is in the condition of stalemate.|$|E
