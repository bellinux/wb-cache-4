5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that people <b>will</b> <b>want</b> {{to take advantage of}} his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out {{that the purpose of the}} computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E

Females will stay with their egg sacs and will guard the young after they hatch. After the spiderlings have had their second moult they will leave the mother and fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{suggested}} range {{given by}} enologists varies from 150mg/l YAN to 400mg of nitrogen per liter. Some {{studies have shown}} that maximum fermentation rates can be achieved with YAN in the 400 to 500mg N/L range. However, not all winemakers <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to have a fermentation going at maximum rate (in terms of yeast biomass, temperature and speed) due to the impact that it can have on other sensory aspects of the wine such as aroma development and fruit retention.|$|E
25|$|Female Eufriesea have fierce stings, so predators <b>will</b> <b>want</b> {{to avoid}} them. Among the Eufriesea genus, females have evolved Müllerian mimetic complexes, making it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the species in the surinamensis group. Male Ef. surinamensis are stingless, but are Batesian automimics as their yellow hindtibial fringes trick other animals into believing they are stinging females and not stingless males. There are also flies that mimic Eufriesea, including asilids. Mimicking Eufriesea may provide these flies protection from their predators.|$|E

Ingjaldus, who is worried that his nephews <b>will</b> <b>want</b> revenge, tries to find them and kill them, but Roas and Helgo survive by hiding on an island near Skåne. When they are old enough, they avenge their father by killing Ingjaldus.|$|E
25|$|The TSP {{has several}} {{applications}} {{even in its}} purest formulation, such as planning, logistics, and the manufacture of microchips. Slightly modified, it appears as a sub-problem in many areas, such as DNA sequencing. In these applications, the concept city represents, for example, customers, soldering points, or DNA fragments, and the concept distance represents travelling times or cost, or a similarity measure between DNA fragments. The TSP also appears in astronomy, as astronomers observing many sources <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to minimize the time spent moving the telescope between the sources. In many applications, additional constraints such as limited resources or time windows may be imposed.|$|E
25|$|Through a {{laboratory}} experiment, {{it was discovered}} that the quality of the food Vespula vulgaris consumes directly affects its body temperature. The higher the quality of the prey, measured by the amount of sucrose present in the food, the higher thorax temperature it had. Such high thorax temperature indicates the wasp's excitement and motivation to collect the offered food. The wasps <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to absorb as much energy as possible because the output of the energy directly coordinates to the power of flight muscles. Higher thorax temperature therefore means more power in thoracic flight muscles, leading to faster movement and in overall, more foraging.|$|E

25|$|Oppal {{apologized to}} the victims’ {{families}} for not informing them of the appeal before it was announced to the general public. Oppal {{also said that the}} appeal was filed largely for “strategic” reasons, in anticipation of an appeal by the defence. The prosecution’s rationale was that if Pickton appeals his convictions, and if that appeal is allowed, resulting in a new trial, the prosecution <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to hold that new trial on the original 26 charges of first-degree murder. But the Crown would be precluded from doing so unless it had successfully appealed the original acquittals on the first-degree murder charges, and the severance of the 26 counts into one group of six and one group of twenty.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} difficult {{to start a}} housing co-op because if the idea is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant mortgage loan for which a financial institution <b>will</b> <b>want</b> assurances of responsibility. It may also take {{a year or more}} for the members to organize the design and construction, as well as time and foresight to establish even basic organizational policies. It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing. It may be somewhat easier to organize a group of closely related housing units. This opportunity may arise, for example, if an existing apartment building's owner is thinking about selling it.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{persistent}} GID {{are characterized}} by more extreme gender dysphoria in childhood than children with desisting gender dysphoria. Some (but not all) gender diverse / gender independent / gender fluid youth <b>will</b> <b>want</b> or need to transition, which may involve social transition (changing dress, name, pronoun), and, for older youth and adolescents, medical transition (hormonal and surgical intervention). Treatment may {{take the form of}} puberty blockers such as Lupron Depot or Leuprolide Acetate, or cross-sex hormones (i.e., administering estrogen to an assigned male at birth or testosterone to an assigned female at birth), or surgery (i.e., mastectomies, salphingo-oophorectomies/hysterectomy, the creation of a neophallus in female-to-male transsexuals, orchiectomies, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, the creation of a neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals), with the aim of bringing one’s physical body in line with their felt gender. The ability to transition (socially and medically) are sometimes needed in the treatment of gender dysphoria.|$|E
