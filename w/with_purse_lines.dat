40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the entanglement of purse-seines, a series of model experiments, based on Tauti's principle was made. A typical two-boat sardine and pilchard purse-seine operating in about 100 fathoms in the deep water of Hyuga-Nada, Japan, {{was chosen as the}} object for this model experiment. The whole dimension was reduced to 1 / 250 of the full scale. With the supposition that the entanglement may be caused by fluttered webbing around the <b>purse</b> <b>line</b> during the <b>pursing,</b> the sinking behaviour of the bottom margin of the net and the change of tension in the <b>purse</b> <b>line</b> in the course of pursing were investigated experimentally. It was found that in the early stage of the fishing operations there was a large amount of loose webbing around the <b>purse</b> <b>line</b> and the tension of the <b>purse</b> <b>line</b> increased sharply.

Despite differences in number of hauls for each net, the curves of cumulative species richness showed that additional hauls could not {{increase the number of}} species collected with {{the commercial}} net. The most abundant species from experimental net catches were Trachurus picturatus, which represented over 80 % of the specimens caught in spring and summer, Naucrates ductor, which represented about 50 % of autumn catches, both in terms of abundance and biomass, and Seriola dumerili, which represented 46 % and 21 % of the samples taken in summer and autumn respectively. Seriola dumerili was also frequent in commercial net catches, in which T. picturatus did not appear, while Coryphaena hippurus and N. ductor represented more than 85 % of both abundance and biomass. Large differences between the two types of net were also obtained in the mean fish weight and length frequency distributions of the catches by season. Fish caught with the experimental net ranged from 6 to 570 mm length, while fish collected from commercial hauls had a size range of 35 to 700 mm. The effectiveness of the experimental net in catching small fishes showed that it can be an optimal sampling method not only in the study of fish fauna associated with flotsam, but also in studies to catch early life stages...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Time {{and again}} the {{technique}} of appendectomy for acute appendicitis has been debated, and optimal management of the stump is still a matter of discussion. Thus, a study was proposed to compare two techniques of management of the stump i. e., simple ligation alone vs. ligation and invagination of the stump <b>with</b> <b>purse</b> string sutures. Aim: To compare and evaluate simple ligation alone with ligation and invagination of the stump during appendectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. Each patient was alternately divided under two groups (Group A: Simple ligation of the stump and Group B: Ligation and invagination of the stump <b>with</b> <b>purse</b> string sutures). The two techniques were compared with respect to duration, intra-operative and post-operative complications. Results: It was observed that simple ligation {{is not only an}} equally safe a procedure, but is also better in terms of duration of the procedure, which was seen to be less in the case of simple ligation alone. Post-operative course as well as duration of hospital stay was similar in both the groups.
