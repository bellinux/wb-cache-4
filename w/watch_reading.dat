40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{describe}} advances {{that make it}} possible to realize the potential of speech recognition to support emerging readers. These advances include improvements in the technology itself and in the design of <b>Watch</b> Me! <b>Read,</b> a tutor that uses this technology to support young readers. In addition, we evaluate <b>Watch</b> Me! <b>Read</b> using a framework for thinking about issues of learning involved in any attempt to implement new technologies. In most discussions of technology implementations, the learning issues remain relatively tacit. By making them explicit, it is possible to assess their coherence as a system (see Brown & Campione, 1996) and their correspondence with what is known about human learning...|$|R

It is required for students to teach the importance of the sports activities in order to promote those activities. 2. The value consciousness about the sports of six categories of play, view, <b>watch,</b> <b>read,</b> support, and talk showed the high value.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine which sleep-related behaviors are most often used by the elderly according to the presence or absence of anxiety and mood disorders. In particular, we are attempting to determine whether these behaviors are associated with the probability of suffering from a mental disorder. The behaviors being examined in the present study are taking naps, television <b>watching</b> or <b>reading</b> at bedtime, physical exercise at bedtime, relaxing activities at bedtime, and caffeine consumption in the evening. Methods: The sample in this study consists of 2, 759 participants aged 65 and over, with a mean age of 73. 8. They were recruited through a method of random generation of telephone numbers according to a sampling strategy based on geographic location. After the goal of the study was explained to them, the participants agreed to have health professionals visit their home and to answer questions in an hour-and-a-half-long structured interview (after signing a consent form). Results: Taking naps is the activity most often practiced by the elderly. <b>Watching</b> television and <b>reading</b> at bedtime are also frequent practices among them. The probabilities of suffering from anxiety are greater if the person never or rarely consumes caffeine after 6 pm, if the individual takes naps during the day, or if the person practices relaxation before bedtime. Television <b>watching,</b> <b>reading,</b> and physical exercise before bedtime are activities that are not associated with the probability of suffering from a mental disorder. Conclusion: It would be beneficial for research to be conducted to support the findings on behavioral differences between depressive and anxious seniors so that these behaviors can become further indicators of the presence of mental disorders...|$|R
