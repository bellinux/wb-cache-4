40|$|The {{research}} {{seeks to}} design a motorized rice thresher that can be manufactured by local artisans and accessed by all small-holder rice farmers. The concept of the thresher emanated from the working principles of a throw-in axial flow thresher a peg type threshing mechanism and a screw type threshing mechanism. Components of the thresher were designed and a prototype was made. The power requirement of the thresher was evaluated and validated with the power thresher standards of the Institute of Agricultural Machinery Japan which recommends an average power requirement of 3. 5 PS or less. The result was a rice thresher with threshing drum of diameter 400 mm and length 1120 mm a threshing drum shaft of diameter 36 mm a shaft bearing SKF self-aligning of designation 1406 a V-belt of number B 66 an SKF <b>wedge</b> <b>belt</b> pulleys of designation PHP 3 SPB 125 TB and PHP 3 SPB 280 TB and a main assembly drawing. The power requirement was 1. 4 PS 1. 03 kW for threshing long crops of length 1282 mm at feed rates up to 402 kghr and 1. 2 PS 0. 88 kW for threshing short crops of length 812 mm at feed rates up to 429 kghr...|$|E

50|$|Tectonic {{units of}} the Western Carpathians are {{arranged}} in belt-like order, with the external units {{in the north and}} internal units in the south. Alpine evolution of the Western Carpathians is dominated by extension and closure of two or three oceanic domains: Triassic-Jurassic Meliata-Halstatt Ocean, Jurassic-Cretaceous Piemont-Vahic Ocean/Zone and Cretaceous-Tertiary Valais-Magura Ocean. After a subduction of the Meliata Ocean, the Internal Western Carpathians were formed. Suturing of Vahic domain finalized thrusting in the Central Western Carpathians, and consuming the crust of Carpathian Flysch Basins caused the formation of the External West Carpathian accretionary <b>wedge</b> (Flysch <b>Belt).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Excepting the {{shoreline}} of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny {{in the west}} to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of [...] the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent <b>wedges</b> of green <b>belt</b> include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the power losses occurring on a tyre-mounted ore-grinding mill designed by Dorbyl Heavy Engineering for Mintek. In order to understand the type of losses occurring on this mill it was decided that a scaled model be built and tested. Such a model mill was designed through the dimensional analysis and similitude technique. This technique enables the reduction of the number of variables to be tested by grouping them into a set of dimensionless parameters, and also allows the results obtained by means of experimentation with the scaled models to be related to the full-scale prototypes. The model mill was constructed in the Mechanical Engineering Workshop at the University of Cape Town. The overall dimensions of the model are 1400 mm long, 1070 mm wide and 892. 5 mm high. Its drive-train comprises an electric motor, the <b>wedge</b> and timing <b>belts</b> with the appropriate pulleys, a differential gear set, the tyres, a shell and a disc brake sub-assembly. The tyres used to drive the shell can either be of the pneumatic or solid rubber types.

40|$|The {{data about}} the Paleogene basin evolution, palaeogeography, and geodynamics of the Western Carpathian and Northern Pannonian domains are summarized, re-evaluated, supplemented, and newly interpreted. The {{presented}} concept is illustrated {{by a series of}} palinspastic and palaeotopographic maps. The Paleogene development of external Carpathian zones reflects gradual subduction of several oceanic realms (Vahic, Iňačovce-Kričevo, Szolnok, Magura, and Silesian-Krosno) and growth of the orogenic accretionary <b>wedge</b> (Pieniny Klippen <b>Belt,</b> Iňačovce-Kričevo Unit, Szolnok Belt, and Outer Carpathian Flysch Belt). Evolution of the Central Western Carpathians is characterized by the Paleocene-Early Eocene opening of several wedge-top basins at the accretionary wedge tip, controlled by changing compressional, strike-slip, and extensional tectonic regimes. During the Lutetian, the diverging translations of the northward moving Eastern Alpine and north-east to eastward shifted Western Carpathian segment generated crustal stretching at the Alpine-Carpathian junction with foundation of relatively deep basins. These basins enabled a marine connection between the Magura oceanic realm and the Northern Pannonian domain, and later also with the Dinaridic foredeep. Afterwards, the Late Eocene compression brought about uplift and exhumation of the basement complexes at the Alpine-Carpathian junction. Simultaneously, the eastern margin of the stretched Central Western Carpathians underwent disintegration, followed by opening of a fore-arc basin - the Central Carpathian Paleogene Basin. In the Northern Hungarian Paleogene retro-arc basin, turbidites covered a carbonate platform in the same time. During the Early Oligocene, the rock uplift of the Alpine-Carpathian junction area continued and the Mesozoic sequences of the Danube Basin basement were removed, along with {{a large part of the}} Eocene Hungarian Paleogene Basin fill, while the retro-arc basin depocentres migrated toward the east. The Rupelian basins gained a character of semi-closed sea spreading from the Magura Basin across the Central Western Carpathians up to the Hungarian Paleogene Basin. In the Late Oligocene, the Magura Basin connection with the Northern Hungarian Paleogene Basin remained open, probably along the northern edge of the Tisza microplate, and anoxic facies were substituted by open marine environments...|$|R
40|$|Mass-transport deposits, olistostromes and mélanges {{represent}} significant {{components of}} both modern and ancient continental margins. Tectonic forces and processes constitute {{the most common}} triggering mechanisms to downslope movement and formation of these chaotic rock bodies. At shallow structural levels in tectonically active environments, sediments are subject to small-scale deformation immediately after deposition, at rates and in ways dependent on the interplay and gradual transition between gravitational deformation and tectonic forces during burial. The downward increase of both the consolidation and lithification in buried sediments and the tectonic stress, control the progressive increase of deformation and stratal disruption. The result of these conditions is a continuum of deformation structures of the originally coherent stratigraphic successions where strata disruption and mixing processes are central in the genesis of broken formations and mélanges. The continuum of deformation in chaotic rock units has been described rarely, perhaps because their chaotic structure obfuscates the structural evidence of the deformation path history. The transition between sedimentary and tectonic chaotic processes is marked by an overlapping zone, in which their block-in-matrix fabric formed by tectonic stratal disruption commonly shows a strong convergence of fabric with sedimentary chaotic products. Moreover, the superposition of different mechanisms and processes of disruption and mixing of rocks {{may lead to the}} reworking of existing mélange products and to the formation of polygenetic mélange types. We present a synthesis of data from the Apennines (Italy) and Ordovician Taconic belt in Eastern USA, that show that exists a continuum of stratal disruption and mixing across structural levels or depths of burial in which various processes operate. At shallow structural levels, the occurrence of poorly consolidated sediments favors gravitational deformation whereas at deeper structural levels, with the downward increase of consolidation, the deformation related to tectonic forces becomes gradually more significant. Sedimentary (and diapiric) mélanges represent punctuated stratal disruption mechanisms recording the instantaneous physical conditions in the geological environment {{at the time of their}} formation. The different velocities of movement, the composition and lithification degree of sediments, the geometry and morphology of the depositional setting, and the mode of failure propagation control the nature of the transition between different types of mass-transport chaotic bodies. Tectonic mélanges and broken formations record the history of a progressive deformation event, which may result in different degrees of lithification during the evolution of a tectonic setting. The sediments are affected by a brittle to more ductile deformation that follows their progressive dewatering and strengthening due to burial with depth. Systemic documentation of the mechanisms and processes of the formation of different broken formations and mélanges and their interplay in time and space are highly important to increased understanding of the evolutionary history of accretionary <b>wedges</b> and orogenic <b>belts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to improve our understanding of the structural configuration of convergent margins in response to glacial erosion, synorogenic sedimentation, and subduction of thick crust. Currently, most mechanical development models of convergent margins are disconnected from the role of these processes and their potential coupled tectonic response. To evaluate the role of these processes, we utilized analog sandbox modeling to generate physical insights into the structural growth of <b>wedge</b> shaped thrust <b>belts.</b> We then compared our modeling results to recent, field-based geological and geophysical studies of the St. Elias orogen, located along the convergent margin of southern Alaska. This margin is characterized by large erosive glacial systems, some of the highest recorded depositional rates on earth, flat-slab subduction of ~ 17 km thick section of an oceanic plateau, {{and is one of the}} most tectonically active plate boundaries on earth. ^ The sandbox models in our study simulate the growth and development of an accreting wedge whose deformation is governed primarily by frictional, brittle deformational mechanisms. We used a digital image correlation technique to post-process sequenced photographed images that allow us to calculate velocity vector fields to understand deformational stages and structural configurations of these sandbox analog models. Three models were designed to test the thrust belt response to glacial erosion, synorogenic sedimentation, and subduction of a thick crust. All three models are then compared against an initial baseline model to understand how model parameters such as erosion, sedimentation, and subduction processes independently influence the structural configuration of the orogenic wedge. ^ Major findings from the erosion model are that the wedge responds to erosion in a longitudinal valley by activation of several coeval fore- and back- thrust faults. These coeval structures serve to accommodate shortening and vertical uplift of deeper parts of the wedge in response to progressive erosion. The backthrust faults are located directly beneath the glacial valley or farther back in the wedge. Potential implications for the St. Elias Range are the erosional model is consistent with: a major unexpected structure, the Bagley fault, which is located beneath the Bagley Ice Valley (Bruhn et al., 2012), an important backthrust fault in the development of the thrust belt (Berger et al., 2008), and the exhumation of deeper crustal rocks beneath glacial valley (Enkelmann et al., 2015). ^ The sedimentation model key findings are that the introduction of a thick section of synorogenic strata to the front of the wedge resulted in a geometry change of wider imbricated thrust sheets and broader open hanging wall folds. These changes in thrust sheet geometry in the model results are consistent with similar thrust faults styles interpreted or seen onshore and offshore in the St. Elias orogenic belt (Worthington et al., 2010; Pavlis et al., 2012). ^ Subduction of a thick crust model major findings are the basal décollement fault of the wedge stepped up to a higher stratigraphic level and that the wedge structural configuration adjusted by displacement on coeval out-of-sequence forethrust and backthrust faults, allowing uplift of the entire wedge. Potential implications for the St. Elias orogen with progressive subduction of thick crust are that the model results are consistent with the relocation of the décollement to higher stratigraphic positions (Pavlis et al., 2012; Van Avendonk et al., 2013), activation of out-of-sequence faults are common (Meigs et al., 2008; Pavlis et al., 2012), and exhumation of deeper crustal rocks within the interior of the wedge (Enkelmann et al., 2015). In summary, our findings indicate that glacial erosion, syntectonic sedimentation, and subduction of thick crust may have significant impact on the structural configuration of glaciated convergent margins. ...|$|R
