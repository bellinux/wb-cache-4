500|$|The plateau was undefended {{save for}} Vergor's camp, as Vaudreuil had ordered {{one of the}} French regiments to {{relocate}} {{to the east of}} the city not long before the landing.

[...] An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to {{on the night of the}} 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame. The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor's camp, but one of Montcalm's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away, then <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> Saunders had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency, firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops, many of them taken from field hospitals; this preoccupied Montcalm.|$|E

I remember one night {{standing on the}} balcony, full of dark thoughts and self-pity, thinking 'God, this is f**king terrible, why me?' I <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> couldn't sleep, got up again. I thought I'd had enough. If it hadn't been for the girls ..."
