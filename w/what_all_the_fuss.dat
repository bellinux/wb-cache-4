5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. This gave the English crowds their first chance to see <b>what</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, hitting a few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see <b>what</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure.

Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing."

[...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up.

500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see <b>what</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

It is also much-maligned: it is often blamed for having a disruptive impact on the outcomes of elections and referenda and for skewing democratic public debate, with the 2016 US Presidential elections and Brexit referendum often cited as examples. “Fake news” has also been flagged for fuelling propaganda and “hate speech” and even violence. “Pizzagate” is an infamous example of exceptional circumstances in which a false news story had {{a central role in}} a shooting incident.

50|$|Croxall {{is notable}} {{because he was}} {{interested}} in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard for their Christian content. He wrote after David F. Swenson and Walter Lowrie had begun translating some of Kierkegaard's works into English, both also hoping to attract Christian readers. Croxall translated Søren Kierkegaard, by Johannes Edouard Hohlenberg, 1954. He studied Søren Kierkegaard's writings for over twenty years and translated Johannes Climacus written in 1843-1844 by Kierkegaard but never published and provided his own assessment. He related Kierkegaard's works to the scriptures in his books Meditations and Kierkegaard Studies, where he wrote: “Kierkegaard is in the air these days. He has not yet, so far as I know, become on the air, but that doubtless will come, for he is constantly quoted and discussed (discussed, I fear, more than read). <b>What</b> then is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> about, and <b>what</b> is his distinctive teaching? Now, any lover of Kierkegaard (and such I most certainly am) longs to answer such a question. He has found in Kierkegaard’s teaching a new and stimulating body of thought, which to him is like a pearl of great price, worth anything to possess. But since the pearl is spiritual treasure, not material, that treasure must be shared if its value is not to diminish. Hence I desire to share the treasure.” Studies 1948 p. 11.|$|R
