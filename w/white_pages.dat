5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is {{tasked with}} winning the Scranton <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> account. However, the CEO is a woman, and Dwight has trouble selling to women. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the <b>White</b> <b>Pages,</b> only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E

2500|$|A CGC 9.0-graded comic, with <b>white</b> <b>pages,</b> was {{auctioned}} {{for sale}} on eBay in August 2014. The seller Darren Adams, a comic book store owner in Federal Way, Washington, had purchased the issue from the estate {{of a man who}} had originally bought the issue from a newsstand on its release in 1938. The original buyer lived in high altitudes in West Virginia and stored the comic in a stack with others, which provided the optimal [...] "cool, dry and dark" [...] conditions that lent well to a comic's age, according to Adams. The comic changed hands twice prior to the auction; first sold as part of an estate sale when the original purchaser died forty years after its publication, and then to a third person who held the comic for about thirty years. Some years prior to the auction, Adams was contacted by this third person, and seeing the pristine condition of the comic, purchased it for a [...] "seven figure sum". He held onto the comic for a few years before deciding to sell it, keeping the existence of it otherwise a secret, even rejecting a $3 million offer to buy the comic outright. On his decision to sell, he opted to use eBay instead of other comic auction houses like Heritage House, believing the auction site would reach a wider audience and was a better fit for the pop culture nature of the piece. After discussions with the site, Adams and eBay also arranged to donate 1% of the sale to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, reflecting on Christopher Reeve's role as Superman in motion pictures. The auction ended on August 24, 2014 and sold for over $3.2 million.|$|E
