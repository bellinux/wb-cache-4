5|$|Built in 1815, Union Street <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> Plymouth's {{historical}} culture. It {{became known}} as the servicemen's playground, as it was where sailors from the Royal Navy would seek entertainment of all kinds. During the 1930s, there were 30 pubs and it attracted such performers as Charlie Chaplin to the New Palace Theatre. It is now the late-night hub of Plymouth's entertainment strip, but has a reputation for trouble at closing hours.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the estates of the {{powerful}} Mowbray and Howard families. Two artificial meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in luxury goods from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By {{the end of the}} 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the castle and the surrounding estates were sold off.|$|E
5|$|In Berlin Busoni <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> {{the musical}} {{world of the}} Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed. He continued to perform whilst his health allowed it; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant {{that he needed to}} undertake tours to England. His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E

5|$|The {{duties of}} the {{principal}} secretary were not defined formally, but as he handled all royal correspondence and determined the agenda of council meetings, he could wield great influence in all matters of policy and in every field of government, both foreign and domestic. During his term of office, Walsingham supported the use of England's maritime power to open new trade routes and explore the New World, and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> international affairs. He was involved directly with English policy towards Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland and France, and embarked on several diplomatic missions to neighbouring European states.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the four {{measures}} aimed at increasing the dependability of Vietnamese soldiers was also aimed at achieving the right ethnic proportion of troops at each garrison. The lack of European troops at Yen Bay had been pinpointed {{as the cause of}} the mutiny. The proposal held that the presence of more European troops at his disposal would have deterred the Vietnamese soldiers from taking part in the mutiny. The decision reversed a major reorganisation of the army that had been launched by General Aubert in 1928. The measure was aimed to demonstrating French strength and superiority over Vietnamese soldiers and revolutionaries, that physical power <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> French colonial rule in Indochina.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the most}} industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for {{the families of the victims}} of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E

5|$|Rupert {{was born}} in Prague in 1619, {{at the start of}} the Thirty Years' War, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, and was {{declared}} a prince by the principality of Lusatia. He was given his name in honour of King Rupert of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor. Rupert's father was a leading member of the Holy Roman Empire and the head of the Protestant Union, with a martial family tradition stretching back several centuries. Rupert's family <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> a network of Protestant rulers across the north of Europe, as Frederick had close ties through his mother to the ruling House of Orange-Nassau in the United Provinces, and Elizabeth was the daughter of James I of England and Anne of Denmark. The family lived an extremely wealthy lifestyle in Heidelberg, enjoying the palace gardens—the Hortus Palatinus, designed by Inigo Jones and Salomon de Caus—and a lavish castle with one of the best libraries in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Praised by T. S. Eliot as {{the most}} {{powerful}} intellectual influence in Britain, historian Christopher Dawson is a key figure in 20th-century traditionalism. Central to his work was the idea that religion <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> every culture, especially Western culture and his writings, including The Age of Gods (1928), Religion and Culture (1948) and Religion and the Rise of Western Culture (1950), reflected this view. A contributor to Eliot's Criterion, Dawson believed that after World War II, religion and culture were central to rebuilding the West in the wake of fascism and the rise of communism.|$|E
25|$|In a 1904 interview, Dvořák {{claimed that}} opera was 'the most {{suitable}} {{form for the}} nation'. If this nationalist sentiment <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> his opera compositions, he also struggled to find a style straddling Czech traditional melody and the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer, which he experienced as lead viola player in the orchestra of Prague's Provisional Theatre between 1862 and 1871, and whose influence is very evident in his works such as Vanda and Dimitrij. His later interest in the music of Richard Wagner also affected his operas, evident in the very extensive rewrite of Dmitrij in 1894, following its failure at Vienna.|$|E
