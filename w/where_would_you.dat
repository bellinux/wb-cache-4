500|$|Frank Arthur [...] "Bones" [...] Jenner (surname often misspelled Genor; 2 November 1903– 8 May 1977) was an Australian evangelist. His {{signature}} {{approach to}} evangelism {{was to ask}} people on George Street, Sydney, [...] "If you died within 24 hours, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] Born and raised in England, he contracted African trypanosomiasis {{at the age of}} twelve and suffered from narcolepsy {{for the rest of his}} life. After some time, he joined the Royal Navy, but deserted in New York and joined the United States Navy. When he was 24, he deserted again while in Australia. He subsequently worked for the Royal Australian Navy until he bought his way out in 1937.|$|E
500|$|The {{group and}} the music {{industry}} were unsure how fans would receive the tour beforehand. During {{the first week of}} shows, Bono said, [...] "This show is a real roller coaster ride, and some people will want to get off, I'm sure." [...] He remained optimistic that their devoted fans would continue following them, but cautioned {{he had no intention of}} resisting the glamour and fame: [...] "Oh, but it's fun to be carried away by the hype. <b>Where</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> be without the hype?... You can't pretend all the promotion and all the fanfare is not happening." [...] Some hardcore fans, particularly in the US, objected to the tour as a blatant sellout to commercial values, while others misinterpreted the tour's mocking of excess, believing that, according to VH1's Legends, [...] "U2 had 'lost it' and that Bono had become an egomaniac". Many Christian fans were offended the band's antics and believed they had abandoned their religious faith.|$|E
500|$|Out of {{gratitude}} to God for giving him salvation, Jenner committed to consistently engaging in personal evangelism, and aimed {{to talk with}} ten different people every day thenceforward. For 28 years, from his initial conversion until his debility from Parkinson's disease, Jenner engaged in this form of evangelism. He probably spoke with more than 100,000 people in total, hundreds of whom made initial professions of commitment to Christianity. He kept religious tracts in his shirt pocket where he had previously kept his rabbit's foot, and he often gave these tracts to people he met. He also kept a card in his pocket with Philippians 4:13 on {{it in order to}} give himself courage in evangelising. This verse reads, [...] "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." [...] While engaging in these activities, Jenner would normally wear a white shirt, black shoes, and trousers, and sometimes a navy greatcoat. Usually evangelising on George Street, Sydney, Jenner asked many people the same question: [...] "If you died within 24 hours, <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> be in eternity? Heaven or hell?" [...] If they were willing to engage in conversation with him, he would invite them either to his home or to a local church. The question became known as [...] "the Frank Jenner question". Jenner was most active in evangelism during World War II. On Saturday nights during the war, Jenner would invite groups of sailors to his home for a service consisting of some hymns and a short sermon.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so <b>where</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> take her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did you get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as you were trying to get her on the school board.” ...|$|E
