5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew the personal and societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The band, Smith in particular, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> {{album with}} a {{different}} producer than Mike Hedges, who had produced Seventeen Seconds and Faith. The group settled on Phil Thornalley. Pornography is the last Cure album to feature founding band member Lol Tolhurst as the band's drummer (he then became the band's keyboardist), and also {{marked the first time}} he played keyboards on a Cure release. The album was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April 1982.|$|E
5|$|Burton set Mars Attacks! up with Warner Bros. and {{the studio}} {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} trading card series on his behalf. The original theatrical release date was planned for the summer of 1996. Gems completed his original script in 1994, which was budgeted by Warner Bros. at $260 million. The studio <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film {{for no more than}} $60 million. After turning in numerous drafts in an attempt to lower the budget, Gems was replaced by Ed Wood writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.|$|E

50|$|William Dieterle, {{later in}} memo to Hal Wallis, dated July 21, 1938, claimed {{he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film but did it as a favour to {{producer}} Hal Wallis. Errol Flynn did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> film either and did not like working for William Dieterle.

5|$|Thomas' father Ross Goodall {{posted the}} video to YouTube on 6 November 2014. He later {{explained}} to media that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> video available {{to his family}} and had no idea it would become popular online. CNN reported that after its appearance on YouTube, the video was viewed over 200,000 times in its first 48 hours online. This more than doubled the next day, and less than a week later it had over 900,000 total views. BBC News observed that Capaldi's message had become a viral video, and ITV News described response to the video as a global phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the developers faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission to make it feel new, while keeping the spirit of the original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, but the fact that both their release dates were far apart and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E

5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s. In 1985, work started {{on the development of}} a modified version for the western suburban lines. The stock on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines were the first that needed to be replaced. At the same time, the company <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> trains compatible with the metro so they could operate on both systems. The new stock was considered to be a trial; if it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock, after the latter reached the end of its economical life in about 2000. The required specification for the new train was published in October 1988.|$|E
5|$|The North American and European {{releases}} of Dirge of Cerberus received a major overhaul as the developers were not completely {{satisfied with the}} final Japanese version of the game. They also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> game more single-player oriented, and as such, they removed Online Multiplayer support, primarily {{due to the lack}} of popularity of PlayOnline outside Japan, and lack of PS2 HDD support in the U.S. Missions from the Multiplayer Mode were reworked into unlockable secret missions in the English-language versions of the game, although none of the additional storyline presented in the Japanese Multiplayer Mode featured in the English versions. The Easy Mode, which was originally featured in the Japanese version to assist gamers not overly familiar with shooter games, was also removed. On September 11, 2008, the English-language version was released in Japan as , as part of Square's Ultimate Hits lineup.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Madonna in different styles and fashions. It also includes her dripping in twenty million {{dollars worth of}} vintage jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, She Done Him Wrong. A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) was hired by Madonna to administer the fake shots, since she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes. Henry Keazor, {{one of the authors}} of Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video, noted that Madonna exposed herself during the interventions portrayed in the video, by playing with the rumors and the stereotypes surrounding her.|$|E

5|$|Three {{camera angles}} were used during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the camera angles was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on his lap. Elsewhere, the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it {{different than any other}} actions involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E
5|$|Titan Quest was {{envisioned by}} game {{designer}} Brian Sullivan as a role-playing game set in Ancient Greece similar to Age of Empires. Production began in 2004 after a successful pitch to THQ. The script {{was written by}} Randall Wallace, while Sullivan acted as the designer. Despite being in a mythical setting, the team <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> environments and towns feel as realistic as possible, leading to {{a large amount of}} research into ancient cultures. Enemies were inspired by the game's regional mythologies, with designs inspired by the stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen. The music, composed by Scott Morton and Michael Verrette, was created to avoid the looping tracks of other games.|$|E
5|$|Walsh missed {{two weeks}} of the 1991–92 {{pre-season}} with a groin injury, and on his first game back for the reserves at White Hart Lane punched reserve team manager Ray Clemence in the face after Clemence substituted him off after an hour. Walsh was suspended for two weeks and upon his return was loaned out to Queens Park Rangers for a month. QPR manager Gerry Francis <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> signing a permanent one, but the club were unable to afford the £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs he again punched someone in the face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.|$|E

5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

25|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Dio Cassius ascribes {{a financial}} motive to Caracalla's decision. He suggests that Caracalla <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> peregrini subject to two indirect taxes that {{applied only to}} Roman citizens: the 5% levies on inheritances and on the manumission of slaves (both of which Caracalla increased to 10% for good measure).|$|E
25|$|In his {{previous}} game, Shadow of the Colossus, director Fumito Ueda {{had intended to}} create an emotional interaction between Mono, the character that Wander wants to save, and the colossi that Wander must fight to save her.
