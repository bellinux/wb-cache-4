2500|$|Once {{the setting}} was established, Gilmore Girls {{developed}} as a mixture of sitcom and family drama. Sherman-Palladino's aim was to create [...] "A family show that doesn't make parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> something sharp in their eyes while they're watching it and doesn't talk down to kids." [...] She wanted the family dynamic to be important because [...] "It’s a constant evolution ... You never run out of conflict.” The show's pace, dialogue, and focus on class divisions was heavily inspired by the screwball comedies of the 1930s and Katharine Hepburn–Spencer Tracy films. Sherman-Palladino was also influenced by the [...] "acerbic wit" [...] of Dorothy Parker.|$|E
2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

50|$|Deutsch and Bonnet {{disagreed}} {{whether they}} should build cars of front-wheel drive or mid-engined design. There was also disagreement on which engines to use. Charles Deutsch, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> Panhard engines, left DB in 1961 to found his own firm (CD). Bonnet founded Automobiles René Bonnet, producing cars powered by Renault engines: this business was later {{to become part of}} Matra Automobiles. Deutsch ended up an engineering consultant.|$|R

2500|$|The {{management}} {{team at the}} Ginger Media Group were considering expansion opportunities, including a plan to acquire the Daily Star newspaper from United News & Media, and hire Piers Morgan to edit it.

50|$|On July 2, 1919, the Prime Minister of Romania, Ion C.

While Xymox clearly <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> their 1980s roots, he started exploring new musical directions. The new, young dance culture intrigued him and a post as in-house producer at the famous One4Two studio's in Amsterdam was readily undertaken.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controversy}} did not {{damage the}} ties of the Government and the Church {{in the long}} run, but both sides did make amends and changes in policy in relation to one another.

[...] "After the Herd we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the sound that we started with and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> finish with it," [...] he says.

30|$|Likewise, {{the sales}} {{representative}} cannot {{say whether the}} DM <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> transaction-based pricing and therefore reject the fixed-price contract for a fixed price of 60. This is because the cdf for transaction-based pricing does not completely lie below that for the fixed-price contract {{as indicated by the}} inner gray area. It would for a price of 0 (or below). Therefore, the upper price limit (or price ceiling) derived from FSD for rejecting the fixed-price contract is 0.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the game}} was being {{designed}} for a 3D display instead of an exclusively flat one like its predecessors, the design team had to pay extra attention to how objects and characters appeared in regard to lighting and shading, and that no obvious flaws could {{be seen from the}} different perspective.

The pick gives its holder unnatural abilities with stringed instruments. Infatuated by the prospect of becoming the next great rock star, JB immediately sets Tenacious D on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from a rock history museum.

50|$|It was {{reported}} that Lee Mi-Yeon {{signed a contract with}} KBS for this drama for only 100 episodes. However, due to high viewership rates, KBS <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> extend the episodes for more than 100 originally. Since Lee Mi-Yeon <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> with the original contract, she refused to do episodes more than 100. However, KBS still extended Empress Myeongseong and had Choi Myung-Gil for the role. This will be seen as Lee Mi-Yeon's last episode was Episode 81 and Choi Myung-Gil started at Episode 82. The viewers should not be confused as Lee Mi-Yeon also had a death scene which is actually a music video for the OST.|$|R
50|$|However, {{sales were}} dropping, {{and by the}} mid-1980s, NME had hit a rough patch and {{was in danger of}} closing.

Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers. A number of features entirely unrelated to music appeared on the cover in this era, including a piece by William Leith on computer crime and articles by Stuart Cosgrove on such subjects as the politics of sport and the presence of American troops in Britain, with Elvis Presley appearing on the cover not for musical reasons but as a political symbol.|$|R
