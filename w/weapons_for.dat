5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{successful}} contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design {{evolved from a}} straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become {{commonly referred to as}} the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker).|$|E

5|$|Combat in {{the game}} is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of {{missions}} beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu {{in order to use}} their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} area around the Bastille {{developed}} further. Early modern Paris continued to grow, {{and by the end of}} the century it had around 250,000 inhabitants and was one of the most populous cities in Europe, though still largely contained within its old city walls – open countryside remained beyond the Bastille. The Arsenal, a large military-industrial complex tasked with the production of cannons and other <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> the royal armies, was established to the south of the Bastille by Francis I, and substantially expanded under Charles IX. An arms depot was later built above the Porte Saint-Antoine, all making the Bastille part of a major military centre.|$|E

5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed the launching and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1890s, Saetta was {{frequently}} reduced to reserve, in part to reduce maintenance on the vessel. Folgore made a temporary return to active service in 1895, when she joined Saetta for the annual maneuvers. In 1897, she was withdrawn from front-line service and employed with the gunnery school; her gun armament was accordingly increased in 1902 to provide a variety of <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> gunnery trainees to practice operating. In the meantime, Folgore was stricken from the naval register in 1900 and broken up for scrap. Saetta continued in her service with the gunnery school until 1908, when she too was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E

5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2. The rebuilt aircraft would have extended the operating life of the Nimrod fleet by several decades and significantly improved the aircraft by installing more efficient Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan jet engines to almost double the flight range. The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional <b>weapons</b> <b>for</b> anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
