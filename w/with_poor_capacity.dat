40|$|Fire {{is a major}} {{disturbance}} {{process in}} many ecosystems world-wide, resulting in spatially and temporally dynamic landscapes. For populations occupying such environments, fire-induced landscape change is likely to influence population processes, and genetic patterns and structure among populations. The Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee is an endangered passerine whose global distribution is confined to fire-prone, semi-arid mallee shrublands in south-eastern Australia. This species, <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>capacity</b> for dispersal, has undergone a precipitous reduction in distribution and numbers in recent decades. We used genetic analyses of 11 length-variable, nuclear loci to examine population structure and processes within this species, across its global range. Populations of the Mallee Emu-wren exhibited a low to moderate level of genetic diversity, and evidence of bottlenecks and genetic drift. Bayesian clustering methods revealed weak genetic population structure across the species ’ range. The direct effects of large fires, together with associated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of suitable habitat, {{have the potential to}} cause population bottlenecks, serial local extinctions and subsequent recolonisation, all of which may interact to erode and homogenise genetic diversity in this species. Movement among temporally and spatially shifting habitat, appears to maintain long-term genetic connectivity. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic patterns is that, following extensive fires, recolonisation exceeds in-situ survival as the primary driver of population recovery in this species. These findings suggest that dynamic, fire-dominated landscapes ca...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is a major}} human {{pathogen}} causing chronic liver disease. We have recently found that the large extracellular loop (LEL) of human CD 81 binds HCV. This finding prompted us to assess the structure-function features of HCV-CD 81 interaction by using recombinant E 2 protein and a recombinant soluble form of CD 81 LEL. We have found that HCV-E 2 binds CD 81 LEL with a Kd of 1. 8 nM; CD 81 can mediate attachment of E 2 on hepatocytes; engagement of CD 81 mediates internalization of only 30 % of CD 81 molecules even after 12 h; and the four cysteines of CD 81 LEL form two disulfide bridges, the integrity of which is necessary for CD 81 -HCV interaction. Altogether our data suggest that neutralizing antibodies aimed at interfering with HCV binding to human cells should have an affinity higher than 10 − 9 M, that HCV binding to hepatocytes may not entirely depend on CD 81, that CD 81 is an attachment receptor <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>capacity</b> to mediate virus entry, and that reducing environments do not favor CD 81 -HCV interaction. These studies provide {{a better understanding of}} the CD 81 -HCV interaction and should thus help to elucidate the viral life cycle and to develop new strategies aimed at interfering with HCV binding to human cells...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Most {{groups have}} {{reported}} disappointing results with autoaugmentation or detrusor myectomy for low capacity/compliance neuropathic bladders. Failure {{may be due}} to an ischemic diverticulum or mucosal shrinkage. We investigated whether a Silimed (R) silicone balloon placed in the bladder after autoaugmentation could prevent these problems, improving surgical results. Materials and Methods: We compared the results of standard bladder autoaugmentation in 12 children (group 1) with those in 10 (group 2) who underwent the same surgery using a bladder conformer. The conformer was a silicone balloon filled with saline that remained in the bladder for 2 weeks. All patients had a neuropathic bladder <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>capacity</b> and compliance, resulting in urinary leakage between catheterizations. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation included a voiding diary, ultrasound, voiding cystourethrogram and urodynamics. Results: In group 1 only 1 patient became dry, 4 had little improvement in continence, 4 remained unchanged and 3 became worse. In group 2, 6 patients (60 %) become continent without medication, 2 (20 %) become continent with oxybutynin and 2 remained unchanged. Bladder capacity and compliance did not change significantly in group 1. However, in group 2 capacity changed from a mean of 140 to 240 ml and mean +/- SD compliance increased from 15. 6 +/- 16. 8 to 34. 3 +/- 22. 8 ml/cm H(2) O (p = 0. 02). Conclusions: The inflatable balloon improved our long-term results of bladder auto-augmentation. A larger series may be necessary to confirm procedure efficacy and safety...|$|E

40|$|The dwindling {{supply of}} fossil fuels and the harmful green house gases which they produce have driven {{research}} towards developing a reliable and safe solution. Alternative forms of transportation, such as hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and all electric vehicles in turn have recently received vast consumer attention. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are seen as the most promising option in HEVs and PHEVs. However, while prevalent in watches, computers and phones, significant improvements in both energy density and rate capability need to be achieved before LIBs are suitable for vehicular applications. Decades of research has yielded a range of anode and cathode materials that exhibit higher capacity and better rate capability than the traditional graphite and LiCoO 2 found in commercial batteries. Unfortunately due to material pulverization and electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions high performance materials are often plagued <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> <b>capacity</b> retention and material degradation. Surprisingly, {{many of the issues}} accompanying high performance materials can be suppressed by the application of as little as 8 angstroms of Al 2 O 3 on the surface. Ultrathin, conformal, ceramic passivating layers are grown using a thin _lm technique called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Self-limiting and easily tailored, ALD is a superior coating method compared to the more common wet-chemical methods such as sol-gel. Conformal ALD is applied to commercially common materials (graphite, LiCoO 2), as well as high energy density alternatives (MoO 3, Li(Ni 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3) O 2). It will be shown that the ALD coating protects high surface area state-of-the-art nanoparticles from decomposition and protects electrode surfaces from HF attack and dissolution even up to 5. 0 V. In addition to extending overall electrochemical cycling stability, ALD will be shown to minimize hazards and risks, such as thermal runaway, by preventing unwanted side reactions with the organic liquid electrolyte. ALD is a simple, non-toxic and effective method for the implementation of LIBs in high power applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} make an update of recent {{publications}} and guidelines for evaluation in coronary symptom-free patients undergoing vascular surgery. It emphasizes the role of preoperative clinical evaluation that should identify the most appropriate testing, and treatment strategies to optimize care of the patient and avoid unnecessary testing {{in this era of}} cost containment. Selective preoperative coronary artery disease screening and revascularization achieve excellent perioperative and late results after high-risk vascular surgery. Supplemental preoperative evaluation is discussed (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography and stress tomoscintigraphy). Asymptomatic patients with good functional capacity can undergo intermediate-risk surgery without further non-invasive testing. Conversely, further noninvasive testing is often considered for patients <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> functional <b>capacity</b> or moderate functional capacity but higher-risk surgery especially for patients with 2 or more intermediate risk predictors. Additional testing may be considered on an individual basis for patients without clinical markers but <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> functional <b>capacity</b> prior to vascular surgery, particularly those with several minor clinical risk predictors. Because of a higher prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia in diabetes mellitus, these patients require specific care. Until further data are available, indications for myocardial revascularization in the perioperative setting are similar to those in the ACC/AHA guidelines for use of myocardial revascularization in general. General practioners, cardiologists, angiologists, vascular surgeons and anaesthesiologists should collaborate and aim to slow down the progression of atherosclerosis by giving their patients an optimum secondary cardiovascular prevention.

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} treatment {{decision-making capacity}} (DMC) to consent to psychiatric treatment in involuntarily committed patients and to further investigate possible associations with clinical and socio-demographic characteristics of patients. METHODS: 131 involuntarily hospitalised patients were recruited in three university hospitals. Mental capacity to consent to treatment {{was measured with}} the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T); psychiatric symptoms severity (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS-E) and cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE) were also assessed. RESULTS: Mental capacity ratings for the 131 involuntarily hospitalised patients showed that patients affected by bipolar disorders (BD) scored generally better than those affected by schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) in MacCAT-T appreciation (p < 0. 05) and reasoning (p < 0. 01). Positive symptoms were associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> <b>capacity</b> to appreciate (r = - 0. 24; p < 0. 01) and reason (r = - 0. 27; p < 0. 01) about one's own treatment.

40|$|Tree sparrows (Passer montanus) {{have been}} studied in two areas in Sweden since 1997. At both sites, tree sparrow eggs had remarkably low {{hatching}} success. On average only 60 % of the eggs hatched. Analyses have shown that this was caused by embryonic mortality, which was highly sex biased. About 70 % of the dead embryos were males, while about 65 % of all fledged nestlings were females. Impaired hatching success here related to two factors. Hatching success was lower for pairs with a male in poor body condition, and it was lower in areas with a high local population density. A sex bias in the mortality early in life has been demonstrated in several species. Since the competitive ability of males is determined by conditions early in life, parents <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> provisioning <b>capacity</b> should prefer to produce female offspring in broods reared under poor conditions. The body condition of a tree sparrow during the nestling stage was well correlated to the condition as an adult, and pairs in which the male parent was in poor condition produced chicks in poor condition. Since the breeding success of a pair depended more {{on the condition of}} the male, females appear less affected by conditions early in life. Parents <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> provisioning <b>capacity</b> appear to bias offspring survival towards females, and a difference in the early susceptibility may be adaptive. Changes in birth sex ratios have in some cases been suspected to result from exposure to estrogenic environmental pollutants. This was examined by exposing great- and blue tit embryos to a synthetic estrogen. Although there was a difference in the mortality rate, the difference was present also in the control groups, why this could not be attributed to estrogen exposure...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fat {{is stored}} in adipose tissue. In obesity, {{differentiation}} of preadipocytes to new adipocytes (fat cells) is required for energy storage. Otherwise fat accumulation in non-adipocytes contributes to fatty liver and diabetes. Our goal was to assess subject characteristics associated <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> in-vitro differentiation <b>capacity</b> of preadipocytes from omental (OM) and abdominal subcutaneous (SC) fat. APPROACH: A convenience sample of, 4 males and 20 females, age 39 ± 2 (range 20 - 56) years, BMI 42 ± 2 (23 - 63) kg/m 2 (i. e. from lean to obese), 7 Caucasian, 8 Hispanic, 1 other and 8 African Americans) undergoing elective surgery was studied. Fat samples collected during surgery were used for histology and preadipocyte isolation. Fat cell diameters and their distribution (normal or bimodal) were analyzed from histology. Preadipocyte differentiation capacity was measured in vitro. RESULTS: In the OM depot, no effect of ethnicity, sex or HbA 1 c was found. Unexpectedly, subjects <b>with</b> preadipocytes <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> differentiation <b>capacity</b> tended to be younger (poor differentiation group 36 ± 2 years versus high 43 ± 3 years, p= 0. 09) and to have lower fasting glucose (poor 97 ± 3. 65 mg/dl versus high 111 ± 7. 08 mg/dl, p= 0. 06). In SC, no differences were noted. Fat cell size {{was not associated with}} differentiation capacity in either depot. Bimodal distribution, which may show formation of new adipocytes, was seen mostly in Caucasian subjects (5 out of 7) compared to Hispanic (3 out of 8) and African Americans (2 out of 8).

It is unknown if these dimensional relationships exist in patients. We analyzed the relationship of exercise capacity and LV dimension in a cohort of sequential patients with a normal ejection fraction undergoing stress echocardiography. In a total of 137 studies the following questions were addressed: (a) is there a difference in LV dimensions of patients with an excellent exercise capacity versus patients <b>with</b> a <b>poor</b> exercise <b>capacity,</b> (b) how is LV dimension and exercise capacity affected by LV wall thickness and (c) how do LV dimensions of patients who are unable to walk on a treadmill compare to the above groups. Patients <b>with</b> a <b>poor</b> exercise <b>capacity</b> or who are unable to physically exercise have a 34 percent smaller LV cavity size when compared to patients with an excellent exercise capacity (p< 0. 001). This reduction in LV chamber size is associated with concentric LV hypertrophy and a reciprocal increase in resting heart rate. In addition, cardiac output reserve is further blunted by chronotropic incompetence and a tachycardia-induced LV volume reduction. In conclusion the relationship of exercise capacity and cardiac dimensions described in extreme athletes also applies to patients. Our exploratory analysis suggests that patients who cannot sufficiently exercise have small LV cavities...|$|R

A possible explanation may be the difference in abdominal compliance between males and females. In patients with a decreased abdominal compliance, the same change in intra-abdominal volume will result in a greater change in IAP. Central obesity usually results in increased visceral fat and a sphere-like baseline shape of the abdominal cavity <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> stretching <b>capacity,</b> whereas in peripheral obesity the internal abdominal diameter is shaped as an ellipse and has a huge stretching capacity (and thus higher abdominal compliance) [27].

In this study, we first detected Ob-R expression in murine DC.

Similarly, selective blockade of leptin with a soluble mouse Ob-R chimera (Ob-R:Fc) inhibited DC generation in wild-type BM cultures. The reduced DC yield in db/db BM culture was attributed to significantly increased apoptosis, which was associated with dysregulated expression of Bcl- 2 family genes. Moreover, db/db DC displayed markedly reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules and a Th 2 -type cytokine profile, <b>with</b> a <b>poor</b> <b>capacity</b> to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation.

Mining areas in western China are mainly located in soft rock strata <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> bearing <b>capacity.</b> In {{order to make the}} deformation failure mechanism and strength behavior of weakly consolidated soft mudstone and coal rock hosted in Ili No. 4 mine of Xinjiang area clear, some uniaxial and triaxial compression tests were carried out according to the samples of rocks gathered in the studied area, respectively. Meanwhile, a damage constitutive model which considered the initial damage was established by introducing a damage variable and a correction coefficient. A linearization process method was introduced according to the characteristics of the fitting curve and experimental data. The results showed that samples under different moisture contents and confining pressures presented completely different failure mechanism. The given model could accurately describe the elastic and plastic yield characteristics as well as the strain softening behavior of collected samples at postpeak stage. Moreover, the model could precisely reflect the relationship between the elastic modulus and confining pressure at prepeak stage. 1...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{has been associated}} with hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease but the possible role of hemolysis in the pathogenesis or pathophysiology of other forms of PAH has not been studied. Erythrocyte lifespan is the gold-standard test of hemolysis and may be measured by assaying erythrocyte creatine (EC) levels. EC decreases as the erythrocyte ages, so patients with hemolysis have high EC levels. MethodsWe measured EC and other parameters of hemolysis in patients with idiopathic and connective tissue associated PAH and normal controls. ResultsIn patients with PAH (n = 40), EC levels were higher than in controls n = 30 (patients EC 1. 72  mcmol/g HgB 95 %CI[1. 51, 1. 96], controls EC 1. 05  mcmol/g HgB [0. 93, 1. 19], p <  0. 0001). High levels of EC correlated with worse 6  min walk (r = − 0. 42, p <  0. 0001) and worse functional class (p =  0. 002). Other indirect indices of hemolysis (total lactate dehydrogenase, red cell distribution width) were also increased in patients with PAH relative to controls. ConclusionsThere is evidence of subclinical hemolysis in patients with PAH, and higher levels of hemolysis are associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> exercise <b>capacity...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{clinical}} {{characteristics of}} internal medicine ward (IMW) patients with candidemia are unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to define the clinical characteristics of candidemic IMW patients and to study the incidence, species distribution, and outcomes of these patients compared to surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) candidemic patients. MethodsA retrospective cohort of candidemic patients in IMWs, general surgery wards, and an ICU at Beilinson Hospital during the period 2007 – 2014 was analyzed. ResultsA total of 118 patients with candidemia were identified in six IMWs, two general surgery wards, and one ICU in the hospital. Candida albicans was the leading causative agent (41. 1 %). Higher proportions of Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis isolates were observed in the IMW patients. IMW patients were significantly older, <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> functional <b>capacity,</b> and had more frequently been exposed to antibiotic therapy within 90 days, in particular β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and cephalosporins. At onset of candidemia, a significantly lower number of IMW patients were mechanically ventilated (p 48 h. ConclusionsIMW candidemic patients account for a substantial proportion of candidemia cases and have unique characteristics and high mortality rates...|$|R
40|$|A high {{frequency}} of bronchopulmonary infections complicating rheumatoid arthritis {{has been described}} in reports of case series. This study was undertaken to confirm and compare these finding in patients with RA and control. 117 patients with RA and 103 patients with OA/soft tissue rheumatism as controls. Study subjects were studied using their medical records available from hospitals‘ casenotes and GP data base. Details of all documented bronchopulmonary infections for the preceding year including lower and upper respiratory tract infections were recorded. Details of hospital admissions due to bronchopulmonary infection, antibiotic usage and functional capacity were also recorded. Mean age for RA was 56 and 59 for control. There were 34 males and 83 females in RA group, however, 14 males and 55 females in control group. There were at least 1 episodes of BPI in 66. 7 % (p< 0. 05) patients with RA and 48. 5 % in control. 69. 2 % (p< 0. 05) of subgroup patients with RA were noted to have <b>poorer</b> functional <b>capacity</b> compared to 50 % in control. More RA patients with BPI (15 %) (p< 0. 05) were admitted to hospital compared to control (3. 8 %). Significance findings were noted in terms of prevalence of BPI in RA patients compared to controls as well as patients with RA have severe course of BPI warranting hospitalization. RA patients <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> functional <b>capacity</b> also noted to have high incidence of BPI...|$|R
40|$|Lung volume {{reduction}} surgery (LVRS) {{for chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recommended in both British and international guidelines because trials have shown improvement in survival in selected patients <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> baseline exercise <b>capacity</b> and upper lobe-predominant emphysema. Despite this, few procedures are carried out, possibly because of historical concerns about {{high levels of}} morbidity and mortality associated with the operation. The authors reviewed data on lung volume reduction procedures at their institution between January 2000 and September 2012. There were no deaths within 90  days of unilateral LVRS (n = 81), bullectomy (n = 20) or intracavity drainage procedures (n = 14). These data suggest that concerns about surgical mortality should not discourage LVRS in selected patients with COPD, provided that it is undertaken within a multidisciplinary team environment involving appropriate patient selection...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Oppositional {{behavior}} in childhood is a probabilistic {{risk factor for}} the subsequent development of more serious conduct problems characteristic of conduct disorder (CD). The capacity to understand the subjective states of others (socioemotional competence) helps regulate antisocial {{behavior in}} typical development. We hypothesized that socioemotional competence moderates the developmental relationship between oppositionality and CD symptoms, such that oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms pose the greatest risk for subsequent CD symptoms in children <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> socioemotional competence. Method Parent-report data were collected for 6, 218 children at 7 and 10 years of age. Bootstrap multiple regression predicting CD symptoms at age 10 {{was used to test}} for an interaction between socioemotional competence and ODD symptoms, while also accounting for direct effects and controlling for sex, maternal education, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, and CD symptoms at 7 years. We further tested whether the interaction applied to both males and females, and to both aggressive and rule-breaking CD symptoms. Results A significant interaction was found between ODD and socioemotional competence: the association between oppositionality at 7 years and CD traits at 10 years was strongest for children <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> socioemotional <b>capacities.</b> As predicted, this moderation effect was significant in a model predicting aggression, but it was not significant for rule-breaking CD symptoms. Conclusion Socioemotional competence moderates the developmental relationship between mid-childhood oppositionality and more serious conduct problems in later childhood. A capacity to understand the subjective states of others may buffer the risk posed by oppositionality for later CD symptoms, including aggression...|$|R
