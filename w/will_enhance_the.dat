There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (>30%) are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (>20%).|$|E

25|$|In India the {{majority}} of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought. The religious establishment forms part of the mainly two large divisions within the country, namely the Deobandis, who dominate in numbers (of whom the Darul Uloom Deoband constitutes one of the biggest madaris) and the Barelvis, who also make up a sizeable portion (Sufi-oriented). Some notable establishments include: Al Jamiatul Ashrafia, Mubarakpur, Manzar Islam Bareilly, Jamia Nizamdina New Delhi, Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad {{which is one of the}} largest learning centres for the Barelvis.

500|$|The project {{started in}} 1994 and was {{initially}} limited to Sognefjellsvegen, Gamle Strynefjellsveg, Hardanger and the Helgeland Coast Route. These were officially designated National Tourist Routes in 1997, and, the following year, the Storting decided {{to expand the}} project. Municipalities were asked to nominate roads, resulting in 52nominees covering [...] Eighteen routes were selected in 2004, {{with the goal of}} completing the necessary upgrades and officially opening them as National Tourist Routes by 2015. The upgrades are estimated to cost 800million Norwegian kroner (ca. €100 million). This includes building resting places, parking lots, viewpoints, and clearing vegetation. The Public Roads Administration's aim is that use of design <b>will</b> <b>enhance</b> <b>the</b> visitors' experience. While most of the architecture has been designed by young Norwegians, French-American Louise Bourgeois and Swiss Peter Zumthor have designed stops in Varanger and Ryfylke. Artworks have been installed at selected viewpoints, including one by American fine artist Mark Dion. All routes were signposted and officially designated by 2012. That year, the architecture magazine Topos awarded the project a special prize for its use of architecture, and particularly noted that it was a public-sector focus on aesthetic design.|$|E
