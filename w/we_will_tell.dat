The Bishop shall tell him, and you and I, and Miles Furley, and Cross. He shall hear all about it. He is with us! He must be with us! You shall put him on the Council. Why, there is your great {{difficulty}} solved," [...] she went on, in growing excitement. [...] "There is not a working man in the country who would not rally under `Paul Fiske's' banner. There you have your leader. It is he who shall deliver your ultimatum." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, Father Andrew," [...] {{answered}} Hugh, [...] "souls have passed, {{and souls}} are near to passing. Let us in, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, then, Hafrydda, and I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you all." [...] As we {{have already}} told the reader all, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not <b>tell</b> it over again, but leap at once to that point where the princess asked, {{at the close of}} the narrative, what her friend {{intended}} to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, if I {{took you}} seriously----! I don't {{want us to}} be hurt more than--more than <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be. <b>Tell</b> me the poem. I've never had a poem written about me!" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{were they}} wise in so doing? We may judge of a man's wisdom, my friends, by his success. We English are very apt to do so. We like {{practical}} men. <b>We</b> say--I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> {{you what a}} man is, by what he can do.|$|R
60|$|We saw the prison, {{and saw the}} prisoners; {{and what}} we did see, and what we thought, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> at once in our own way.|$|E
6000|$|I said, [...] "That {{is where}} you do wrong. When you want {{information}} come to Harris or myself; <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you the truth about these questions." ...|$|E

6000|$|The valiant Vikram nearly {{started from}} his seat at the word cemetery, but, like a ruler of men, he {{restrained}} his face from expressing his feelings, and he presently replied, [...] "Good, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> come, <b>tell</b> us on what day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> not <b>tell</b> you, and if {{you find}} us <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not know you. You seem surprised. What welcome would you get from the girl whose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed, from the mother whose dishonour comes from you? ...|$|R
60|$|He did see Mrs. Bell, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> now <b>tell</b> who he was, {{and why he}} had come, and how it came to {{pass that}} his carpet-bag was brought down to the widow's house {{and one of the}} front {{bedrooms}} was prepared for him, and that he drank tea that night in the widow's parlour.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> no old tales, Nor heed if in {{wandering}} air Die a lost song of love Or {{the once}} fair; Still as well-water be The thoughts we share! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} be my friend, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> each other all our secrets. You are a Protestant too. You will be mine, and not Bridgeman's or Dunord's--I hate them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Be careful--take no notice, {{fill your}} buckets, but listen {{carefully}} all the while, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> {{you what to}} do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also.' ...|$|E
60|$|Having thus {{stated the}} {{principles}} {{upon which the}} Commons hold him and all governors responsible, and upon which we have grounded our impeachment, and which must be the grounds of your judgment, (and your Lordships will not suffer any other ground to be mentioned to you,) <b>we</b> <b>will</b> now <b>tell</b> you what are the grounds of his defence.|$|R
60|$|What that is I {{will show}} you presently; and a {{wonderful}} tale hangs thereby. But first <b>we</b> <b>will</b> let Analysis <b>tell</b> us what chalk is made of, {{as far as he}} knows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right, my dear. At any rate, till he {{is getting}} strong <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not <b>tell</b> him {{what we think of}} him. Anyhow, it can't do any harm to tell him we know it, and may do him good, for it is clear he does not like telling it himself, and may be {{dreading}} our questioning about the affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will come}} {{to take care of}} us, John? And you, Mr. Neigh, would like to come? <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> Mr. Ladywell that he may join us if he cares to,' said Mrs. Belmaine.|$|E

6000|$|... "By that time," [...] {{declared}} Louise, [...] "Tato's {{education will}} be accomplished, {{and she will}} be as refined and ladylike as any girl of her age <b>we</b> know. Blood <b>will</b> <b>tell,</b> they say, and the monk who taught her {{must have been an}} intelligent and careful man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} great fun to shoot a tiger," [...] Richards said. [...] "When I came out to India I thought {{there was going to}} be lots of tiger shooting, and I bought a rifle on purpose, but I have never had a chance yet. Yes, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{certainly}} get up a tiger hunt, won't <b>we,</b> Wilson? You <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> us how to set about it, won't you, Doolan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Tasor, [...] "nor is it a Manatorian name. Come, while I {{search for}} a hiding place for you in some {{forgotten}} chamber {{in one of the}} untenanted portions of the palace, and as <b>we</b> go I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you briefly how Tasor the Gatholian became A-Sor the Manatorian.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you have}} told us the story of Steinar <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you {{who we are and}} what we seek," [...] {{answered}} the man, adding: [...] "Fear not, we mean him no harm, but rather good if he is the man we think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since you ask {{us again}} and again, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> you. We are not robbers or murderers. We are praying people.

6000|$|... "Baba! Hear our Father speak.

Here it {{is easily}} {{seen that the}} {{variable}} section A(x) acts on the dynamical behavior of ϕ and ψ, and thus on that of (ρ,u,p). The severe change of entropy inevitably leads to the variation of other physical variables. The GRP solver that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> derive <b>tells</b> precisely how the entropy and the cross section affect the dynamics.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you!" [...] said I, {{with my eyes}} filling fast; but I {{thought they}} might, when {{it was not for}} myself. [...] "Ada loves him--we all love him, but Ada loves him as <b>we</b> cannot. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> her what you say. Thank you, and God bless you, in her name!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In “To The Moon”, Bea {{learns that}} her {{daughter}} Debbie has died of a drugs overdose. Bea is devastated and tries hanging herself, only to be stopped by Liz {{with the help of}} Boomer and Doreen. Erica is unable to let Bea attend the funeral because she is on remand and a high risk inmate, so Will Jackson goes to the morgue and passes a message on to Debbie’s body for Bea. This is where <b>we</b> hear <b>Will</b> <b>telling</b> Debbie that Bea [...] "loves her to the moon and back".|$|R
60|$|IT HAS {{just been}} told how three unlucky adventures fell upon Robin Hood and Little John {{all in one}} day {{bringing}} them sore ribs and aching bones.

"One sees {{strange things}} in the Black Kloof," [...] replied Anscombe {{speaking}} for the first time, [...] "and much has happened to us since we were parted, to which you are {{not strong enough to}} listen now.

5000|$|With this {{declaration}} of war, radio {{became part of}} the propaganda campaign. Throughout the war, the attack on Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda. Direct wartime programming began shortly after the United States entry into the war. The first live broadcast to Germany, called Stimmen aus Amerika ("Voices from America") took place on Feb 1, 1942. It was introduced by [...] "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" [...] and included the pledge: [...] "Today, and every day from now on, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be with you from America to talk about the war.... The news may be good or bad for us - <b>We</b> <b>will</b> always <b>tell</b> you the truth." ...|$|R
