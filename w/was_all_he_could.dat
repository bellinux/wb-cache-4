2500|$|In April Fischer {{notified}} Goddard {{that the}} Navy {{wanted to do}} all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, [...] "Esther, don't you know there's a war on?" [...] Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, [...] "I was wondering when you would ask me." [...] Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger—a long range missile—but JATO <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> manage, hoping for a greater project later. It {{was a case of}} a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.|$|E
2500|$|Brian, MI-13, and S.H.I.E.L.D. began {{investigating}} a suspected return of Mys-Tech {{but he was}} swiftly beaten down and captured by Death's Head II. This was actually a ruse by Death's Head II to plant a tracking device and find out why the Psycho-Wraiths wanted the captain (he didn't bother to tell Brian). The Prime Wraith wanted the hero {{to be part of}} six living batteries for a monotrace core, opening a portal to Hell for Mephisto's armies (led by the brainwashed hero Killpower) to ravage the Earth. Captain Britain was freed and fought to hold back the demons, and tried to find a solution other than killing Killpower. [...] "We're heroes, we don't --" [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say before Killpower was gunned down by the anti-heroes Major Hauer, Death's Head, and Colonel Liger. Afterwards, on a whim Captain Britain placed a union flag on top of a damaged Big Ben, deciding that surviving the battle gave them [...] "the right to celebrate a little" ...|$|E
2500|$|At this time, Western Qin {{not only}} had to face Northern Liang attacks, but had {{suffered}} a major earthquake in late 429 and a major drought for most of 430 as well. [...] Most of Qifu Mumo's people fled. [...] He felt that his state could no longer stand. [...] He sent his officials Wang Kai (王愷) and Wuna Tian (烏訥闐) to submit to Northern Wei, requesting Northern Wei troops to escort him to Northern Wei territory. [...] Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei was pleased, and promised that after he can destroy Xia, he would bestow Xia's Pingliang (平涼) and Anding (安定) Commanderies (collectively roughly modern Pingliang, Gansu) as Qifu Mumo's domain. [...] Qifu Mumo therefore destroyed his own royal treasury and set Fuhan ablaze, heading east with the only 15,000 households that remained under him, to try to join Northern Wei troops at Shanggui (上邽, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), but the Xia emperor Helian Ding (Helian Chang's brother and successor), upon hearing this, engaged him and stopped his advances, and {{he was forced to}} take up defensive position at Nan'an. [...] By this point, Nan'an <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hold; all of his old territory in the west had been seized by Tuyuhun.|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say. They {{drove him}} away from his {{instrument}} this time for good, because Bernhardt has been calling up Esmeralda ever since without getting an answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! no! I {{really could}} not allow that,' {{answered}} Gudu. 'They {{would only make}} you ill. Be content with the green fruit.' And as they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get, Isuro <b>was</b> forced {{to put up with}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr Thorne has openly {{declared}} {{to me that}} a marriage between poor Frank and Mary <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> desire for his niece. After such unparalleled audacity as that, even your father will see the necessity of breaking with him." ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell Sam of importance, and the Rover boy went off, {{to rejoin}} his chum {{in a very}} {{thoughtful}} mood.|$|E
6000|$|The completeness, clearly, {{after an}} instant, had {{struck him as}} divine. [...] "Ah, my dear, my dear, my dear--!" [...] It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are mistaken," [...] murmured Dick. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say, for he {{was still}} too bewildered to make a clear note {{of what was going}} on.|$|E
6000|$|To {{say nothing}} {{here of the}} truer reading ("men of your nation"), there [...] is no {{consequence}} in the argument. The Ebionites were Christians in a [...] large sense, men of Christian profession, nominal Christians, as [...] Justin allowed the worst of heretics to be. And this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> [...] mean by allowing the Ebionites to be Christians.|$|R
60|$|WISE. How! why like to a thief that is found. He {{would stand}} gloating,[14] and hanging down {{his head in}} a sullen, {{pouching}} manner; a body might read, as we used to say, the picture of ill-luck in his face; and when his father did demand his answer to such questions concerning his villainy, he would grumble and mutter at him, and that should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get.|$|R
60|$|Wise. How! why, like to a Thief that is found. He {{would stand}} {25b} gloating, and hanging down {{his head in}} a sullen, {{pouching}} manner, (a body might read, as we use to say, the picture of Ill- luck in his face,) and when his Father did demand his answer to such questions concerning his Villany, he would grumble and mutter at him, and that should <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mine moder," [...] <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say, as {{he groaned}} heavily. In {{a few seconds}} he {{recovered}} with a start and bade {{the man in the}} bow paddle for his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] he demanded, in {{a muffled}} tone, for {{inside of the}} bag it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to breathe. The {{covering}} was so heavy {{he could not see}} a thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has his {{daughter}} still," [...] Le Neve put in, vaguely. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{think of to}} say by way of consolation; and to him, Cleer Trevennack would have made up for anything.|$|E
6000|$|Yes. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> right! <b>He</b> <b>could</b> {{not argue}} with me while so {{important}} a person engaged him. [...] . I came boldly down the steps.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{could not}} take it in <b>all</b> at once. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> stunned. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} <b>was</b> that a far worse thing had happened than anything <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have imagined.|$|R
60|$|Charlie {{sat there}} arguing all the evening, {{but it was}} no good, and the idea o' them people sitting there and refusing to let 'im have his own money pretty near sent 'im crazy. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> do to kiss Emma good-night, and 'e couldn't have 'elped {{slamming}} the front door if he'd been paid for it. The only comfort he 'ad got left was the Sydney gal's photygraph, and he took that out and looked at it under nearly every lamp-post he passed.|$|R
60|$|Upon this {{he went to}} get the Dog, {{which came}} running with signs of great delight; but the Prince was so much afraid of it that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from showing his alarm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'God Himself can {{do nothing}} here! It is done! And that is the end!' He turned his head; it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from groaning. The old man's voice vibrated with earnest {{conviction}} as he spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|Ferris {{stood beside}} Hal's body. Presently {{he thought he}} heard a low moan, and he {{imagined}} that Hal moved one arm. His teeth chattered worse than ever, and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from rushing away.|$|E
60|$|Gruffanuff, who {{had seen}} what had {{happened}} with the King, and knew that Giglio must come to grief, got up very early the next morning, and went to devise some plans for rescuing her darling husband, as the silly old thing insisted on calling him. She found him {{walking up and down}} the garden, thinking of a rhyme for Betsinda (TINDER and WINDA <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find), and indeed having forgotten all about the past evening, except that Betsinda was the most lovely of beings.|$|R
60|$|Ginger {{tried to}} explain, but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> no good, and two minutes arterwards 'e was {{walking back to}} 'is lodgings like a dog with its tail between its legs. His 'ead was going round and round with astonishment, and 'e {{was in such a}} temper that 'e barged into a man twice as big as himself and then offered to knock his 'ead off when 'e objected. And when Sam and Peter asked him 'ow he 'ad got on, he was in such a state of mind it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> do to answer 'em.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{another small}} basin of thin gruel {{as his own}} <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> with {{thorough}} self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say: ...|$|R
60|$|We'd a swore it if he'd been a dog; {{and so we}} done it. Well, he couldn't love us {{enough for}} it or be {{grateful}} enough, poor cuss; it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to keep from hugging us.|$|E
6000|$|That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say till he had digested {{a pair of}} thoughts: Just {{what did}} she mean by [...] "types"? Had it {{something}} to do with printing stories? And what could he say about the people, anyway? He observed: ...|$|E
6000|$|All of the Royer boys {{noticed that}} Dan Baxter {{did not turn}} up at roll call, nor did the bully put in an {{appearance}} that night. [...] "Got a day off," [...] said Mumps, but that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have done!" [...] It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say, {{for like}} many {{he had heard}} of men visiting the Painted Lady by stealth, and he had only wondered, with other gossips, who they were.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{they made}} their way along the {{mountain}} road, which their guide in front <b>was</b> doing <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to make smooth for them. And then at the corner they found a log hut, to which their guide pointed triumphantly.|$|R
60|$|Our curate {{said very}} well then: he had warned him, and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. If <b>he</b> (Mr. Coombes) was {{determined}} to {{make a fool of}} himself, he (Mr. Coombes) must do so.|$|R
60|$|Yes, he {{had seen}} her as they passed his ambush the first thing in the morning. She looked very white and tired, but she was walking. She was not bound in any way. That <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell him.|$|E
60|$|Hour {{after hour}} went slowly by, and still Captain Moore did not return. What {{had become of}} his brother, Joe could not imagine. He feared the worst, and when morning came it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to keep back the tears.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do to {{keep himself}} from {{screaming}} out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.|$|E
60|$|In {{the stillness}} of the house, the sound of a door had {{revealed}} to Louis where to seek his cousin. It was in the grand saloon, where the closed shutters availed not to exclude the solid beams of slanting sunlight falling through the crevices, and glancing on the gilding, velvet, and blazonry upon the costly coffin, that shut her out from the dear tender hands and lips that had never failed to caress away her childish griefs. At first, the strange broad lines of shadowy light in the gloom <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see, but one ray tinged with paly light a plaited tress, which could only be Clara's flaxen hair.|$|R
6000|$|To recompense [...] "Westminister" [...] for {{the loss}} of his day's work, to make a dubious {{statement}} that nights were never so black as they appeared to <b>be,</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> venture to do. Creed hesitated in the doorway.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't swear at Oom Sam too hard," [...] Monty continued. [...] "Remember for {{the last}} two days <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{to get us out of}} the place. It was those fetish fellows who worked the {{mischief}} and he--certainly--warned us <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> took us safely to Bekwando and he worked the oracle with the King!" ...|$|R
