5|$|Private sector {{participation}} in Colombia's {{water and sanitation}} sector has been much more stable than in some other Latin American countries. In 2004, there were 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies in Colombia, including large, medium and small companies. Private sector involvement in the Colombian <b>water</b> <b>sector</b> began in 1995 in Cartagena, {{with support from the}} World Bank. The most important examples are in Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Tunja, Montería, Palmira, Girardot, and Riohacha. Operators are to a large extent Colombian. Overall performance of utilities with private sector participation has improved, in some cases spectacularly, and some – such as Barranquilla – have had impressive successes in expanding coverage to the urban poor.|$|E
40|$|Urban <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> in industrialised {{countries}} are increasingly facing a {{diverse range of}} challenges. Aging assets, environmental concerns and economic issues {{put pressure on the}} current governance and organisation of these sectors. In recent years, a plethora of neoliberal reforms have been initiated in various countries as efforts to counteract these developments. While rather successful in infrastructure sectors, such as energy or telecommunication, neoliberal reforms have proven difficult in many industrialised, urban <b>water</b> <b>sectors.</b> The article argues that this is related to distinct characteristics of the <b>water</b> <b>sectors.</b> Specificities include large-scale technologies, high externalities {{and the nature of the}} good. This article analyses these key characteristics of urban <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> and shows their implications and challenges for neoliberal reforms by drawing on the privatisation of the English <b>water</b> <b>sectors.</b> The results show key trade-offs between economic and environmental issues, and less with social goals...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe principal-subordinate {{hierarchical}} multi-objective programming {{model of}} initial water rights allocation was developed {{based on the}} principle of coordinated and sustainable development of different regions and <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> within a basin.

40|$|Tensions {{between the}} energy and <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> occur when demand for {{electric}} power is high and water supply levels are low. There are several regions of the country, such as the western and southwestern states, where the confluence of energy and water is always strained due to population growth. However, {{for much of the}} country, this tension occurs at particular times of year (e. g., summer) or when a region is suffering from drought conditions. This report discusses prior work on the interdependencies between energy and water. It identifies the types of power plants that {{are most likely to be}} susceptible to water shortages, the regions of the country where this is most likely to occur, and policy options that can be applied in both {{the energy and}} <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> to address the issue.

25|$|The Public Expenditure Report of the <b>Water</b> <b>Sector</b> {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the patterns of budget spending. It appears that in the <b>water</b> <b>sector</b> large part of the budget is made up of development expenditures and only 15% are recurrent expenditures (compared to the 55% share of development expenditures in the total government budget). Moreover, {{as a result of the}} decentralization policy of the government, the budget allocated to local government authorities and regions has increased rapidly. In fiscal year 2008-2009 LGAs had a share in the total <b>water</b> <b>sector</b> budget of about 25%, while the figure was 20% for regions. Conversely, an increasing part of central government budget is devoted to feasibility studies: this reflects the co-ordinating and policy setting role to which MoWI is shifting.|$|E
40|$|Government {{attempts}} to reform Australia's energy and <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> {{in the past}} decade have occurred during a time ofsustained change in the agricultural industry. The confluence of these factors has heightened demand for limited water resources. Corporatization of publicly owned utilities and the restructure of Australia's electricity industry have introduced a radically new management regime for hydrogenerators. Having renounced their capacity-driven mindset, hydrogenerators are now reluctant to surrender any part of their water allocation unless it is economically attractive to do so. In addition, water reforms have driven a fundamental shift in water management with the requirement for environmental flows and opportunities for water trading. This chapter examines the relationship between the energy and <b>water</b> <b>sectors</b> {{in the context of the}} restructured Australian electricity industry...|$|R

A common sector policy framework, monitoring as well as a common sector program and strategy are being developed by the major donor agencies. Since 2007 an Annual <b>Water</b> <b>Sector</b> Review (AWSR) is carried out which helps to foster the alignment of donor projects among other things.

Accordingly, the <b>water</b> <b>sector</b> is considered as a higher priority for government action by rural Tanzanians. 44% of respondents in rural areas cited water supply as one of the three most pressing issues that the government should address (for 16% it {{is the single most important}} problem).
