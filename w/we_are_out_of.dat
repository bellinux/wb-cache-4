"We protest {{before your}} Majesty {{and the whole}} world that until this great person be removed from {{intermeddling}} with the great affairs of state, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given." [...] Despite Parliament's protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even if {{what he did}} {{were the}} right thing to do, this was not the way to do it." [...] "The {{surrender}} might have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: My friends, for the present, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> danger. But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling. But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{families}} of prisoners, {{the staff of}} closed and censored publications, the victims of eviction and confiscation — none were ever turned away. I have met influential [...] "civil society" [...] Palestinians alive today who were protected as students when Israel was a professor of chemistry at the Hebrew University; from him they learned never to generalize about Jews. And they respected him, not just for his consistent stand against discrimination, but also because — he never condescended to them. He detested nationalism and religion, and {{made no secret of}} his contempt for the grasping Arafat entourage. But, as he once put it to me, [...] "I will now only meet with Palestinian spokesmen when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the country. I have some severe criticisms to present to them. But I cannot do this while they are living under occupation, and I can 'visit' them as a privileged citizen." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} moment <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that room and in the cab and moving quick.|$|R
60|$|Within a {{few minutes}} afterwards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the canal, and in the Ohio river again.|$|R
60|$|He glanced {{round to}} make sure <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> earshot, then sunk his voice to a whisper.|$|R
2500|$|After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, {{appeared}} in a spoof of The Bourne Ultimatum, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon {{on the red carpet}} one time and before he could finish the interview he said, [...] "Sorry, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time." [...] The most recent encounter was titled [...] "The Handsome Men's Club" [...] which featured Kimmel, along with the [...] "Handsome Men", who were: Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Lenny Kravitz, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Keith Urban, John Krasinski, Ethan Hawke, Josh Hartnett, Tony Romo, Ted Danson, Taye Diggs, Gilles Marini, and Ben Affleck, speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than Matt Damon, stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. Jennifer Garner also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off Dancing with the Stars appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, causing Kimmel to describe himself as [...] "the three-headed dog the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell".|$|E
60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. Well, I {{think you}} might at least drop them until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> mourning.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a strategist," [...] Forrest remarked grimly. [...] "Do as she says, Cecil. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this, the better." ...|$|E
60|$|She looked round cautiously. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{plantation}} now, {{in the open}} park, where eavesdropping was impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house. 'You are not {{dreaming of}} it, are you?' ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Turning on him, sarcastically.] I'm glad someone's feeling good. [Wearily.] Gee, I sure wish <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this dump {{and back}} in New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "Into the bedchamber of the Lady Letitia Mandeleys!" [...] {{he proclaimed}} triumphantly. [...] "Keep your voice low, boy. Remember <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> doors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear papa and all, good-bye. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land. Three years, and keep {{up a good}} heart. I shall soon be all right.|$|E
6000|$|The captain {{dropped his}} gun upon the ground. [...] "Miss Markham!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Mrs. Cliff! I truly believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all danger--that we--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Makarooroo, quick march, and don't draw rein till {{we reach}} the cave," [...] said Jack when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of the canoe.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{the night}} began to shut in, however, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, and Darius {{said as we}} hauled in the drags for the last time: ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{sight of}} land {{without a single}} {{celestial}} body to guide us! Even the pendent world was not visible from our position! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" [...] Mr. Hethcote said, as {{the fire}} ceased and the boats headed for a light hung up to direct then.|$|E
6000|$|A certain added {{brightness}} {{came into}} Ann's face. [...] "Nobody won't {{be able to}} come leaving cards on us, Artie, now, any more. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{live or die}} {{together}} this day," [...] said he; [...] "keep but fast hold till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press, and then my horse is yours." ...|$|E
60|$|Turning as {{he spoke}} and making an easy way for us, he stopped when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} {{him from the}} room, and when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing on the stoep inquired what he thought. I {{did not like the}} look of that leg.|$|R
6000|$|These words {{caused the}} Englishman to glance back apprehensively, and hurry on faster than ever. [...] "It's a beastly woods," [...] he said. [...] "I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that at last!" [...] exclaimed Matt, as {{the road}} finally {{appeared}} in sight. [...] "Now {{to see if any}} damage has been done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let us hurrah until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the woods," [...] added Dick soberly. [...] "We are in {{the hands}} of a desperate gang, to my way of reasoning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the woods}} or not," [...] said {{the owner of}} the launch. [...] "Where there is one bob cat there are often more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing, but <b>we</b> {{saw them}} at it, {{and walked up}} and down till Lance got tired out, and Willie and I stayed to make it proper.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Let me {{take you}} to Winks and Pinks,” she said as soon as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the building: “they’ve got such lovely shades of blotting-paper—pearl and {{heliotrope}} and momie and crushed—” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ugh! I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this!" [...] muttered Matt, as {{he tried}} in vain to pierce the gloom ahead. [...] "You must find the road, Billy, for I can't see it----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall ask no {{questions}} till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the harbour, {{or you will}} be running foul {{of one of those}} colliers--a tribute with which the Fair Unknown may dispense.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do? I'd rather take my chances on the Sally, even if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight of land, than stay here another minute. This brig has got ghosts aboard!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] he replied. [...] "If the Abati go anywhere, it's to hell, {{where they}} haven't {{whitewashed}} walls and four-post beds. Oliver, wake up. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that cave, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{less than}} an hour they'll have force enough to do as they please. It's time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this; you go home to tell Joe, and I'll see Mr. Wright if possible." ...|$|R
60|$|I put up {{the tiller}} and eased the sheet, and the salmon boat ran off five or six points. Big Alec watched us till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range, when he {{returned}} to his work.|$|R
6000|$|Arthur <b>was</b> silent till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing. Then {{he said to}} himself, almost inaudibly, [...] "Where two {{or three}} are {{gathered}} together in my name, there am I {{in the midst of}} them." ...|$|R
