5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a <b>water</b> <b>bird,</b> a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E

25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black colobus), antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and <b>water</b> <b>bird</b> species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972.

2500|$|Among {{coastal and}} some wetland areas, various water birds {{can come to}} {{contribute}} {{a large portion of}} both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available. [...] The most regularly reported <b>water</b> <b>bird</b> prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the [...] common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the [...] Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), [...] mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), [...] black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the [...] Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the [...] yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands. The diet of eagle-owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the [...] mew gull (Larus canus), [...] Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and [...] common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet includes most type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the [...] hoopoe (Upupa epops), the [...] European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the [...] common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the [...] European roller (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant [...] Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) [...] is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls.
