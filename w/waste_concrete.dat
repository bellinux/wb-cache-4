40|$|In Japan, {{the most}} of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps have been reused as roadbed {{materials}} and the recycling ratio of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps has been kept over 95 % from 2000. However, {{it is expected that}} the demands of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps as roadbed materials would decrease even though the <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps increase with the pulling down buildings in next decade. These facts mean that the recycling of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps would be in the negative situation. Therefore, the development of new recycling technology of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps is paramount importance in Japan. In this work, the pulsed power discharges inside of <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> scraps immersed in water were used to reproduce the coarse aggregate.

The physical and mechanical properties, micro/nano structure, durability, and environmental performance of the produced bricks are studied in a systematic way. Moreover, the enhancement of the mine tailings-based geopolymer bricks by adding cement kiln dust (CKD) is studied. The third part of the research investigates the recycling of the fines fraction of crushed <b>waste</b> <b>concrete</b> to produce binder through geopolymerization in order to completely recycle concrete waste. The results indicate the viability of geopolymerization of mine tailings by optimizing the synthesis conditions. By properly selecting these factors, mine tailings-based geopolymer bricks can be produced to meet the ASTM standard requirements and to be environmentally safe by effectively immobilizing the heavy metals in the mine tailings. The physical and mechanical properties and durability of the mine tailings-based geopolymer bricks can be further enhanced by adding a small amount of CKD.
