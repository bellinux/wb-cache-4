He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember he said to me I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|The weather at Manzanar caused {{suffering}} for the incarcerees, few {{of whom were}} accustomed to the extremes of the area's climate. The temporary buildings were not adequate to shield people from the weather. The Owens Valley lies at an elevation of about [...] Summers on the desert floor of the Owens Valley are generally hot, with temperatures exceeding [...] not uncommon. [...] Winters bring occasional snowfall and daytime temperatures that often drop into the [...] range. At night, temperatures are generally 30 to 40°F (17 to 22°C) lower than the daytime highs, and high winds are common day or night. [...] The area's mean annual precipitation is barely five inches (12.7cm). The ever-present dust was a continual problem due to the frequent high winds; {{so much so that}} incarcerees usually <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> covered from head to toe with a fine layer of dust, and they constantly had to sweep dirt out of the barracks.|$|E
500|$|English {{also makes}} {{frequent}} use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that {{are made up of}} a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment). In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term [...] "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.|$|E

A week later we <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to the dangdest dog-fight we'd ever heard. It was that Spot came back and knocking the team into shape.

That Spot was only three days in coming back, and, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough-house.|$|E
60|$|They cast {{an absurd}} poetry over the landscape; they invited {{themselves}} {{to be reminded of}} passages of European travel by it; and they placed villas and castles and palaces upon all the eligible building-sites. Ashamed of these devices, presently, Basil patriotically tried to reconstruct the Dutch and Indian past of the Mohawk Valley, but here he was foiled by the immense ignorance of his wife, who, as a true American woman, knew nothing of the history of her own country, and less than nothing of the barbarous regions beyond the borders of her native province. She proved a bewildering labyrinth of error concerning the events which Basil mentioned; and she had never even heard of the massacres by the French and Indians at Schenectady, which he in his boyhood had known so vividly that he was scalped every night in his dreams, and <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> expecting to see marks of the tomahawk on the head-board.

60|$|I would willingly {{have kept}} {{myself out of}} the stream which was {{carrying}} along the others; but I could not help knowing what happened. And it was indeed ridiculous. After the great scene at the Palace people had begun to take steps as if for big events. Checco had sent a large sum of money to Florence for the Medici to take care of; Bartolomeo Moratini had made preparations; there were generally a stir and unrest. Girolamo {{was supposed to be}} going to take some step; people were prepared for everything; when they <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> they asked if aught had taken place in the night; and Checco wore a coat of mail. On the Count's side people were asking what Checco meant to do, whether the ovation he had received would encourage him to any violent step. All the world was agog for great events--and nothing happened. It reminded me of a mystery play in which, after great preparation of dialogue, some great stage effect is going to be produced--a saint is going to ascend to heaven, or a mountain is to open and the devil spring out. The spectators are sitting open-mouthed; the moment has come, everything is ready, the signal is given; the mob have already drawn their breath for a cry of astonishment--and something goes wrong and nothing happens.|$|E
