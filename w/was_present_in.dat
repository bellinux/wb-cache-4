5|$|A {{tropical}} storm <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first {{before turning to}} the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in the}} Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, a {{participant}} in the Fourth Crusade and author of De la Conquête de Constantinople, {{at the time of the}} fall of Constantinople to the forces of the Fourth Crusade, Michael <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the city, having possibly returned from exile in the period after the deposition of Alexios III and the restoration of Isaac II and his son Alexios IV in 1203–04. Michael then entered into the service of Boniface of Montferrat, who received the Kingdom of Thessalonica and overlordship over Greece in the division of the spoils among the Crusaders, and followed Boniface west as the latter went to take up his kingdom in September 1204. Villehardouin reports that Boniface trusted Michael, but the latter soon abandoned Boniface and went to Epirus, where he installed himself as the leader of the local Greeks against the Latin Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Naval Treaty, {{the ship}} was {{to be removed from}} front-line service. To this end, she had her main battery guns removed and she was {{converted}} into a radio-controlled target ship. She was redesignated AG-16, and served in this capacity after 1931. In the mid-1930s, she was rebuilt again, as an anti-aircraft gunnery training ship. In 1941, additional anti-aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity. Later in 1941, she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941; after having been hit by two torpedoes, she capsized and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island, where the wreck remains today.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, stiff competition <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E

Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E

5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Kolchak.

5|$|Condor served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of her career, first in German East Africa in the 1890s, followed by a stint in the South Seas Station in the Pacific Ocean in the 1900s.

Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into a storage hulk for mines. After the end of World War I, she was discarded and broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Dogali was {{originally}} designed by William Henry White of Armstrong Whitworth for the Greek Navy.

Italy purchased the vessel and renamed her Angelo Emo and then Dogali before she entered service. Her career was uneventful, with her early years spent with the main fleet conducting training exercises. In 1893 she represented Italy at the World's Columbian Exposition, and <b>was</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Brazil during the Revolta da Armada (Revolt of the Fleet), where she protected Italian interests from the unrest. In 1908, Italy sold Dogali to Uruguay, and she was renamed 25 de Agosto. In 1911, she became Montevideo, and she was decommissioned in 1914. She remained in the Uruguayan Navy's inventory until 1932, when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
