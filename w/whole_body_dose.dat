50|$|The {{effective}} dose E {{is designed to}} account for this variation by the application of specific weighting factors for each tissue (WT). Effective dose provides the equivalent <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> that gives the same risk as the localised exposure. It {{is defined as the}} sum of equivalent doses to each organ (HT), each multiplied by its respective tissue weighting factor (WT).|$|E
5000|$|The {{calculation}} of effective dose {{is required for}} partial or non-uniform irradiation {{of the human body}} because equivalent dose does not consider the tissue irradiated, but only the radiation type. Various body tissues react to ionising radiation in different ways, so the ICRP has assigned sensitivity factors to specified tissues and organs so that the effect of partial irradiation can be calculated if the irradiated regions are known. [...] A radiation field irradiating only a portion of the body will carry lower risk than if the same field irradiated the whole body. To take this into account, the effective doses to the component parts of the body which have been irradiated are calculated and summed. This becomes the effective dose for the <b>whole</b> <b>body,</b> <b>dose</b> quantity E. It is a [...] "protection" [...] dose quantity which can be calculated, but cannot be measured in practice.|$|E

40|$|RADIATION {{protection}} {{studies are}} concerned with individuals receiving chronic <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>doses</b> of about 1 rad per year whereas data on the incidence of leukaemia or cancer have been obtained from individuals receiving {{a limited number of}} <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>doses</b> of about 100 rads or more (see, for example, Court Brown and Doll, 1957, for a typical investigation). In determining acceptable radiation doses it is therefore necessary to extrapolate the data by two orders of magnitude and, at present, there is no established theory to guide this extrapolation. For example I. R. C. P. (1966) use a linear relationship between dose and effect, well aware that this assumption may be incorrect and lead to an over-estimation of risks but satisfied that it is unlikely to lead to an under-estimation of them. As well as the wide, long term interest in helping the understanding of the mechanism of the induction of cancer, an established theory of dose-effect relationships could have considerable economic significance in relaxed health physics regulations. The theory developed in this paper provides an illustration of how large non-linearities in the dose-effect relationship could occur. Althoug...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Case-control study with eight matched controls per case. SETTING [...] Regions of Ontario, Canada, with an operating nuclear facility. SUBJECTS [...] Cases were children (age 0 - 14) who died from or were diagnosed as having leukaemia from 1950 to 1988 and were born to mothers living in the vicinity of an operating nuclear facility. Controls were identified from birth certificates, matched by date of birth and residence at birth. There were 112 cases and 890 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Paternal radiation exposure was determined by a record linkage to the Canadian National Dose Registry. RESULTS [...] Six fathers of cases and 53 fathers of controls had had a total <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> > 0. 0 mSv before the child's conception, resulting in an odds ratio of 0. 87 (95 % confidence interval 0. 32 to 2. 34).

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) utilized simplified geometric shapes with Dose Conversion Factors (DCF) based on homogenized models for the trout reference animal, one of twelve reference animals and plants (RAPs).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether memory performance in adolescents is affected by radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from wireless device use or by the wireless device use itself due to non-radiation related factors in that context.; We conducted a prospective cohort study with 439 adolescents. Verbal and figural memory tasks at baseline and after one year were completed using a standardized, computerized cognitive test battery. Use of wireless devices was inquired by questionnaire and operator recorded mobile phone use data was obtained for a subgroup of 234 adolescents. RF-EMF dose measures considering various factors affecting RF-EMF exposure were computed for the brain and the whole body. Data were analysed using a longitudinal approach, to investigate whether cumulative exposure over one year was related to changes in memory performance. All analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders.; The kappa coefficients between cumulative mobile phone call duration and RF-EMF brain and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>dose</b> were 0. 62 and 0. 67, respectively for the whole sample and 0. 48 and 0. 28, respectively for the sample with operator data.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Commercial isotope {{production}} facilities which operate cyclotrons have traditionally suffered from high maintenance requirements and consequently {{have resulted in}} high personnel radiation doses.
