Obama has often {{described}} Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when Obama mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division {{was the first one}} in there. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>arrived</b> there were no German soldiers anywhere around that I knew about. There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful rags, and most of them were in a bad state of starvation.|$|E
