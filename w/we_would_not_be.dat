The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman.

500|$|Primo Levi {{suggested}} Anne Frank {{is frequently}} {{identified as a}} single representative {{of the millions of}} people who suffered and died as she did because [...] "One single Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of all those people, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to live." [...] In her closing message in Müller's biography of Anne Frank, Miep Gies expressed a similar thought, though she attempted to dispel what she felt was a growing misconception that [...] "Anne symbolises the six million victims of the Holocaust", writing: [...] "Anne's life and death were her own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives... But her fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1st Brigade {{pushed into}} Ramadi, it began aggressively courting the local tribes for police recruits. This was {{critical}} because, according to Colonel MacFarland, [...] "without their help, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to recruit enough police {{to take back}} the entire city." [...] After the Americans promised the tribal leaders in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city, the tribes began sending men into the police force. The number of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 a month before June 2006 to 300 a month by July. AQI tried to blunt police recruitment by attacking one of the new Ramadi police stations with a car bomb on 21 August, killing three Iraqi police. They simultaneously assassinated the Sunni sheikh of the Abu Ali Jassim tribe, who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join the Iraqi Police. The AQI fighters hid the body instead of leaving it for the tribe, violating Islam's funeral rites and angering the tribe. This was one of the catalysts for what became a tribal revolt against AQI. According to David Kilcullen, who would later serve as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to General Petraeus, the revolt began after AQI killed a sheikh over his refusal to give his daughters to them in marriage.|$|E

[...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 {{at the end of the}} year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign.

2500|$|Reaction {{against the}} bill also spawned the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government, which was {{launched}} in February 1937 by three leading opponents of the New Deal. Frank E. Gannett, a newspaper magnate, provided both money and publicity. Two other founders, Amos Pinchot, a prominent lawyer from New York, and Edward Rumely had both been Roosevelt supporters who had soured on the President's agenda. Rumely directed an effective and intensive mailing campaign to drum up public opposition to the measure. Among the original members of the Committee were James Truslow Adams, Charles Coburn, John Haynes Holmes, Dorothy Thompson, Samuel S. McClure, Mary Dimmick Harrison, and Frank A. Vanderlip. The Committee's membership reflected the bipartisan opposition to the bill, especially among better educated and wealthier constituencies. As Gannett explained, [...] "we were careful not to include anyone who had been prominent in party politics, particularly in the Republican camp. We preferred to have the Committee made up of liberals and Democrats, so that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> charged with having partisan motives." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{letter from}} Charles to the then Prime Minister Tony Blair was leaked {{on the day}} of the Countryside Alliance's 'Liberty and Livelihood' protest march in September 2002.

[...] Charles also wrote that if rural people were [...] "any other minority" [...] the government would make greater efforts to protect them. The government was also blamed for [...] "destroying the countryside". Charles was believed to have written the letter in April 2002, and advisers were said to have attempted to persuade him not to send it, and suggested that Charles raise the issue with Blair when next they met. It was not known who [...] "leaked" [...] the letter, with speculation falling on a variety of sources including 10 Downing Street, the Labour Party, sources close to the Charles's household, or the Conservative Member of Parliament Nicholas Soames.

[...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities.

We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes.

Abdullah ibn Umar had also been a mid level commander in the Battle of Yarmouk.

His wife complained to the Roman general and he ignored her. Abu al-Jaid then went to the Muslims and told them that he knows the local area and if the Muslims exempt him and his descendents from taxes for ever he will help them defeat the Roman army. He then took horse men led by Abdullah ibn Umar to the Roman camp at night and attacked them and then ran away. The Romans chased them and in the dark tens of thousands of them fell down a cliff at the an-Naqusah Creek into a river.
