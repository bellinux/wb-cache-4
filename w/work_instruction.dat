[...] Her maternal aunt, Ruth Harris Bohan, was an accomplished oil painter who became an early role model. In the fall of 1935, when she was married with two small children at home, Peet enrolled in painting classes taught by the famous Regionalist painter, Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Institute. Under Benton's guidance, she produced her first multi-figural compositions, her first genre scenes, and her first paintings in egg tempera, a quick-drying medium using egg yolk as the binder. Benton painted in class alongside his students who produced [...] "versions" [...] of his subjects from slightly different angles. In 1939, Margot Peet painted a small version of Benton's iconic allegorical nude, Persephone, which {{is now one of}} the highlights of the American painting collection at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Her painting Do Unto Others is a version of Benton's well-known <b>work,</b> <b>Instruction,</b> which he painted as part of an Art Institute class in 1940. Peet's work produced during this period is now viewed as her best. Benton selected a still life painting by Peet for an exhibition of his students' work that was held at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York City. For the remainder of her life, she continued to paint garden still lifes, flower pieces and portraits.|$|E

There is a lack of consistency in the assembly time analysis performed by planners. The decision support system that was developed in this research is based on mapping controlled language assembly <b>work</b> <b>instructions</b> to Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) tables. Automated analysis of historical <b>work</b> <b>instructions</b> and their related time study analysis were performed by employing knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) algorithms through the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) interface. As a result of this automated analysis, forty-six mapping rules were created that related <b>work</b> <b>instructions</b> to MTM tables and the data backbone for the decision support system that was created. Analyzing large sets of historical data is crucial while creating decision support systems. KDD provides a sustainable method of analyzing big data. Future work of this research includes applying the KDD process to create data backbones for decision support systems to aid in ergonomic evaluations...|$|R
