5|$|The skull <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> {{at the end}} of a thick, S-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail {{acted as}} a {{counterweight}} to balance out the head and torso, with the center of mass over the hips. Tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two-fingered forelimbs, although remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found. Tarbosaurus had the shortest forelimbs compared to its body size, while Daspletosaurus had the longest.|$|E
5|$|The symbol {{used by the}} French rugby {{team was}} a great success, and was later adopted by the French {{delegation}} at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the rooster <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> on five Olympic rings. The rooster has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called les coqs and some French supporters {{have been known to}} release roosters on the playing field before games.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E

25|$|At {{the top of}} {{the incline}} <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> Charles Lawrence, the {{official}} photographer, on a special scaffold from which he would take pictures of the arriving visitors. For 25 cents, visitors could purchase a souvenir photo of their arrival on the incline car, with everyone else aboard, of course. George Wharton James, Lowe’s publicist, had his own publication which touted the railway in its conception, construction and operation.|$|E
25|$|The central shrine: In the centre, {{under the}} dome, {{is a very}} {{beautiful}} shrine for the idol, who is sitting serenely at a height of ten feet or so under a fine baldachino of white inlaid marble. If the whole could be transported to Italy, and a statue of the Virgin substituted for the idol, its beauty would be raved about. A sparrow <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> familiarly on the shrine, and gave us some little friendly chirps to show he did not object to our presence.|$|E

25|$|According to {{traveler}} John Muir, on {{his visit}} to Diomede Islands in the 1880s they found the natives eager to trade away everything they had. The village <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> on the steep rocky slope of the mountain which drops at once sheer into deep water. The huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs. They looked like mere stoneheaps, black dots on the snow at a distance, with whalebone posts set up and framed at the top to lay their canoes beyond the dogs that would otherwise eat them.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the Tag Team Turmoil {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. Tajiri and William Regal were the champions heading into the match. The teams would come out at random, and it was The Heart Throbs who entered first, with the champions Tajiri and Regal coming out next. Tajiri {{utilized}} a lot of kicks and then locked in the Tarantula. The Heart Throbs then kept Tajiri isolated, but Tajiri pinned Antonio with a sunset flip. Simon Dean and Maven entered into the match next, trying to pick apart the weakened Tajiri. Their inclusion in the match did not last very long as Regal made the tag and cleaned house, putting Dean away with a knee to the head. La Résistance came in next, but Regal and Tajiri tried to fight back. Regal was then rolled up, {{with a handful of}} tights, eliminating he and Tajiri and guaranteeing new champions. Rosey and The Hurricane were the last two men to enter the match. Hurricane was then smashed on the turnbuckle post. Hurricane and Rosey got the pin when Hurricane leapt off the shoulders of Rosey, who <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> on the top rope to grab the win.|$|E
500|$|A {{newsletter}} dated 4 April 1461 {{reported a}} widely circulated figure of 28,000casualties in the battle, which Charles Ross and other historians believe was exaggerated. The number {{was taken from}} the heralds' estimate of the dead and appeared in letters from Edward and the Bishop of Salisbury, Richard Beauchamp. Other contemporary sources gave higher numbers, ranging from 30,000 to 38,000; Hall quoted an exact figure of 36,776. [...] An exception was the Annales rerum anglicarum, which stated the Lancastrians had 9,000casualties—an estimate Ross found to be more believable. [...] The Lancastrian nobility had heavy losses. Trollope and Northumberland fell in battle, and Lord Dacre was said to have been killed by an archer who <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> in a [...] "bur tree" [...] (a local term for an elder). [...] Conversely, the Yorkists lost only one notable member of the gentry—Horne—at Towton.|$|E

500|$|Gorgosaurus shared {{its general}} body plan {{with all other}} tyrannosaurids. Its massive head <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> {{on the end of}} an S-shaped neck. In {{contrast}} to its large head, its forelimbs were very small. The forelimbs had only two digits, although a third metacarpal is known in some specimens, the vestigial remains of the third digit seen in other theropods. Gorgosaurus had four digits on each hindlimb, including a small first toe (hallux) which did not contact the ground. Tyrannosaurid hindlimbs were long relative to overall body size compared with other theropods. The largest known Gorgosaurus femur measured [...] long. In several smaller specimens of Gorgosaurus, the tibia was longer than the femur, a proportion typical of fast-running animals. The two bones were of equal length in the largest specimens. The long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips.|$|E
500|$|For {{more than}} a century, the logo of the New York Herald-Tribune, and its later successor, the International Herald Tribune, {{featured}} a hand-drawn [...] "dingbat" [...] between the words Herald and Tribune, which first originated {{as part of the}} front page logotype of the Tribune on April 10, 1866. The [...] "dingbat" [...] was replaced with an all-text header beginning with the issue of May 21, 2008, to give a [...] "more contemporary and concise presentation that is consistent with our digital platforms." [...] The drawing included a clock in the center, set to 6:12p.m., and two figures on either side of it, a toga-clad thinker facing leftward and a young child holding an American flag marching rightward. An eagle spreading its wings <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> atop the clock. The dingbat served as an allegorical device to depict antiquity on the left and the progressive American spirit on the right. The significance of the clock's time remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|Several farms were {{positioned}} near Malvern Hill. Roughly [...] {{north of}} the hill were the Poindexter and Carter farms. Between the two farms was a swampy and thickly wooded area {{that made up the}} course of Western Run. The largest in the area was the Mellert family's farm, usually called the Crew farm for a former owner, situated at the western side of the hill. About {{a quarter of a mile}} due east of Malvern Hill was the West farm. Between these two farms lay the Willis Church Road, which some locals called the Quaker Road. This road also ran past the Malvern house, the hill's namesake, which <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> atop the southern edge of the plateau. [...] "It was, altogether, an exceedingly formidable position", wrote historian Douglas Southall Freeman. [...] "Had the Union engineers searched the whole countryside below Richmond, they could not have found ground more ideally set for the slaughter of an attacking army." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage while wearing [...] multiple donned braided extensions for [...] "Paparazzi". Gaga <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> atop a railing and from each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death. This was followed by [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] as she descended from the top—which signified her rebirth—amidst white lights and mechanical fog. She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to [...] "The Orbit" [...] by Haus of Gaga. The last song of the show was [...] "Bad Romance" [...] which she performed in an '80s-inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high-waisted pants. The show ended with a video of Gaga getting a heart-shaped tattoo on her shoulder, with the word [...] "Dad" [...] {{in the center of}} it.|$|E
500|$|The massive {{skull of}} Albertosaurus, which <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> on a short, S-shaped neck, was about [...] {{long in the}} largest adults. Wide {{openings}} in the skull (fenestrae) reduced {{the weight of the}} head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs. Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, Gorgosaurus at least 62. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The premaxillary teeth {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in cross section. Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary (cheek) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time to come here. And I feel very grateful.... For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and near the end of the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E

2500|$|One view {{holds that}} [...] "Nazareth" [...] {{is derived from}} one of the Hebrew words for 'branch', namely ne·ṣer, נֵ֫צֶר, and alludes to the prophetic, messianic words in Book of Isaiah 11:1, 'from (Jesse's) roots a Branch (netzer) will bear fruit'. One view {{suggests}} this toponym might be an example of a tribal name used by resettling groups on their return from exile. Alternatively, the name may derive from the verb na·ṣar, נָצַר, [...] "watch, guard, keep,"Francis Brown, S. R. Driver, Charles A. Briggs, The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon (1906/2003), p. 665. [...] and understood either in the sense of [...] "watchtower" [...] or [...] "guard place", implying the early town <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> on or near the brow of the hill, or, in the passive sense as 'preserved, protected' in reference to its secluded position. The negative references to Nazareth in the Gospel of John suggest that ancient Jews did not connect the town's name to prophecy.|$|E
2500|$|The liturgical {{reforms of}} the 1960s and 1970s inaugurated {{major changes in the}} {{architectural}} standards of churches worldwide. James Joseph Sweeney, first Bishop of Honolulu and United States delegate to the ecumenical council that met in the Basilica of Saint Peter at the Vatican City, instituted one of the last renovations of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in accordance with guidelines agreed upon with other bishops. [...] Sweeney ordered the removal of the marble communion rails and installed a freestanding marble altar that faced the congregation. [...] The canopied pulpit that <b>was</b> <b>perched</b> above the congregation was also removed in favor of a simple [...] and lectern from which the Gospels could be proclaimed and homilies and sermons could be delivered. [...] The wooden cross atop the old altar was stripped and replaced with a sculptured marble crucifix. [...] The ideology of the time encouraged churches to use native cultural implements in church architecture. [...] Sweeney's cathedral rector, Monsignor Charles Kekumano, installed koa wood wainscot along the walls. [...] The Cathedral's doors were also replaced by heavy koa wood doors.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Michael Collins {{reported}} nine {{sightings of}} Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the Pearl River in Louisiana in 2006 and 2008, including an encounter in which kent calls came from two directions {{at the same}} time, and an additional sighting (of two birds) in the Choctawhatchee River in 2007. Three of these sightings are supported by video evidence. Additional analysis of these videos was published in an earlier paper, along with comments by independent experts. Bret Tobalske, an ornithologist who specializes in the flight mechanics of woodpeckers, performed an analysis of wing motion {{and concluded that the}} bird in the 2008 video is a large woodpecker. Only two large woodpeckers occur north of Mexico, but the flap rate is about ten standard deviations greater than the mean flap rate of the pileated woodpecker. The flight speed, narrow wings, and prominent white patches on the dorsal surfaces of the wings are also consistent with ivory-billed but not pileated woodpecker. Avian artist Julie Zickefoose analyzed the 2006 video and commented on the [...] "rared-back pose, long but fluffy and squared-off crest, and extremely long, erect head and neck" [...] and an unusual short flight that {{does not seem to be}} consistent with a pileated woodpecker. A size comparison was carried out using part of the tree in which the bird in the 2006 video <b>was</b> <b>perched.</b> Two forks made it possible to scale frames from the video relative to a photo of a pileated woodpecker specimen that was mounted on the tree. On the basis of the comparison, it is clear that the bird in the video is a large woodpecker, and the size appears to be consistent with an ivory-billed woodpecker. The 2007 video shows events involving a woodpecker delivering a blow that is accompanied by an audible double knock, unusual swooping flights that are consistent with historical accounts of the ivory-billed woodpecker, and a takeoff with deep and rapid flaps that are similar to the flaps of the closely related imperial woodpecker (Campephilus imperialis) taking off.|$|E
