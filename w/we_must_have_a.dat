He stated, [...] "Rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together {{to provide for}} every child in America to fulfill their expectations." [...] That same year, McCain voted to keep a program which directed ten percent of federal surface transportation funds to firms owned by women and racial minorities. In 1999 McCain pushed legislation which would give companies tax breaks for selling media properties to minorities. In 2003 McCain reintroduced the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a simple}} example, {{consider}} the map f: R2 → R2, given by f(x, y) = (0, y). Then for an equation f(x, y) = (a, b) {{to have a}} solution, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> = 0 (one constraint), {{and in that case}} the solution space is (x, b) [...] or equivalently stated, (0, b) + (x, 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (x, 0) < V: the value of x is the freedom in a solution – while the cokernel may be expressed via the map W → R, [...] given a vector (a, b), the value of a is the obstruction to there being a solution.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the miners}} had {{converted}} their overtime ban into an all-out strike, Prime Minister Edward Heath called a snap general election. Two days before polling day, on Tuesday 26 February, Adamson addressed {{a conference of}} senior managers organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied [...] "if I were them I would try {{to get close to}} the unions and hammer out something better (than the Act)", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because [...] "it is so surrounded by hatred that <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more honest try at another Act".|$|E

In other words, the field creates a fiber-like guiding structure while propagating. If the field creates a fiber and it is the mode of such a fiber at the same time, it means that the focusing nonlinear and diffractive linear effects are perfectly balanced and the field will propagate forever without changing its shape (as long as the medium does not change and if we can neglect losses, obviously). In order to have a self-focusing effect, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> positive , otherwise we will get the opposite effect and we will not notice any nonlinear behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Supporters {{of the ban}} {{state that}} boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing {{spokesman}} for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: [...] "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, {{and we feel that}} <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> total ban on boxing." [...] Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for [...] "injury". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, it {{was decided}} to re-establish the liberal arts college, and on June 14, 1918, the Eastern Nazarene College was {{chartered}} with degree-granting authority in the state of Rhode Island, while secondary education would remain as the Eastern Nazarene Academy. Choosing a new name, however, would be difficult: the school was now a liberal arts college and a Nazarene institution. Candidates included: [...] "Northeastern Nazarene College", [...] "Bresee Memorial College", [...] "Nazarene College of the Northeast", and [...] "Nazarene College and Bresee Theological Institute". General Superintendent John W. Goodwin can be credited with the chosen name, as he wrote to Hiram F. Reynolds, also a general superintendent and a long-time supporter of the school: [...] "I know you will do your best for our New England College. I should be glad if they would change the name to the Eastern Nazarene College, or something like that. It would seem <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> school there, although it moves along hard and slow." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011, the Armenian National Cinema Center {{announced}} that it was holding talks with world-known film director Steven Spielberg and Armenian American screenwriter Steven Zaillian to produce a full-length feature film about the Armenian Genocide. The cinema center director Gevorg Gevorgyan stated that [...] "On the 100th anniversary of the Genocide, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> film to demonstrate to the world. We want more than the films Mayrig or Ararat." [...] Over a year later, in February 2012 the center declined the claims that Spielberg is involved in producing such on the 100th anniversary of the genocide. Vardan Abovian, the deputy director of the Armenian National Film Academy, said that they [...] "indeed have plans on a movie on the Armenian genocide, however, this is still in the 'idea' phase and nothing has been decided yet. We are trying to find the budget." [...] Ruzanna Bagratunyan, spokesperson for the center, stated that the movie [...] "is a huge load of work, and {{we are trying to do}} it in time; all of us understand what this date [...] means for the whole Armenian nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
