25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a reunion}} {{commenced}} {{weeks after the}} trio began speaking again. After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|After she {{accepted}} the role, Richard {{was told by}} Julia Smith {{that she would have}} to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, [...] "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut." [...] From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: [...] "It was vital that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have." [...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a giant leap of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's all up, Jack," [...] Hawtry said, pausing in his run. [...] "It's no use {{making any}} resistance. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> only <b>get</b> our throats cut {{straight}} off." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{band members}} {{did not speak}} from their breakup until 2008. That August, Jerry Finn {{suffered}} a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support. On September 19, Barker and Goldstein {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of the}} night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I thought he was going to die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. [...] "Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again. The trio eventually met up in the hospital, laying the grounds for what was going to be the band's reunion. Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting. Hoppus remembered: [...] "I remember [...] said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.|$|E
2500|$|Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on [...] "(And She Said) Take Me Now", a {{song from}} his debut solo album Justified which was {{initially}} planned to be released as a single, commenting [...] "I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the ABC News Iowa Republican Debate, Paul {{was asked}} if he agreed with Newt Gingrich's [...] "characterization, that the Palestinians are an invented people." [...] Paul responded, [...] "No, I don't agree with that. And that's just {{stirring}} up trouble. And I believe in a non-interventionist foreign policy. I don't think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> in the middle of these squabbles. But to go out of our way and say that so-and-so is not a real people? Technically and historically, yes-- you know, under the Ottoman Empire, the Palestinians didn't have a state, but neither did Israel have a state then too." ...|$|E
5000|$|To <b>get</b> [...] <b>we</b> just <b>should</b> <b>get</b> {{rid of the}} product. We could {{compute the}} product {{directly}} from already computed roots [...] of [...] but we could use simpler form.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ominous, isn't it?" [...] Carroll said at length. [...] "If this is {{the valley}} Hartley came down, and {{everything}} points to that, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>getting</b> near the spruce." ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{element of}} British public and {{political}} sentiment favoured a negotiated peace with Germany, among them Halifax as Foreign Secretary. Over {{three days in}} May (26–28 May 1940), there were repeated discussions within the War Cabinet of whether the UK should associate itself with French approaches to Mussolini to use his good offices with Hitler to seek a negotiated peace: they terminated in refusal to do so. Various interpretations are possible of this episode and of Churchill's argument that [...] "it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> better terms than if we fought it out", but throughout Churchill seems to have opposed any immediate peace negotiations. Although at times personally pessimistic about Britain's chances for victory—Churchill told Hastings Ismay on 12 June 1940 that [...] "ou and I will be dead in three months' time"—his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British for a long war.|$|E
2500|$|A famous {{quotation}} of Clarke's {{is often}} cited: [...] "One {{of the great}} tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion." [...] He was quoted in Popular Science in 2004 as saying of religion: [...] "Most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> rid of it as quick as we can." [...] In a three-day [...] "dialogue on man and his world" [...] with Alan Watts, Clarke stated that he was biased against religion {{and said that he}} could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time. In his introduction to the penultimate episode of Mysterious World, entitled [...] "Strange Skies", Clarke said: [...] "I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers," [...] reflecting the dialogue of the episode, in which he stated this concept more broadly, referring to [...] "mankind". [...] Near the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he said that his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, [...] "The Star" [...] (1955), and making Mysterious World (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said: [...] "How romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean they}} are {{absolutely}} fearful? My son has told me they are quite impossible, and I am quite prepared for that. Do you ask how <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> on with them? My dear young lady, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> on as you do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The luck is dead against us! It {{looks as}} if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> at that gold! There’s a two-knot stream on her bow, and she’ll drift to leeward fast.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, that is {{two miles}} farther at least. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> not <b>get</b> home until long after dark. We shan't be an hour by the hills. We know every {{foot of the}} way." ...|$|R
60|$|BERTLEY. [Appropriating the gesture.] Capital, I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> on in time.|$|E
60|$|But that didn't {{discourage}} us. We {{felt sure}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> it clean in time.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. I dont say you have, dear. If only I could persuade you Ive grown up, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> along perfectly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{it would}} take us YEARS,' exclaimed another. 'Just look at all those tall green branches, {{spreading}} in every direction. If once we got entangled in THEM, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> out again!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a dog-goned bad {{business}} I {{have brought}} you into, Tom. I reckoned <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>get</b> out without troubles, but I did not calkerlate on our getting into them so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was my}} revolver. I had {{to shoot}} a sentry, to save my life. It's lucky we have got these life belts on, for I am sure <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> across." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "An odd lot, aren't they?" [...] said Arthur. [...] "I thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> 'em {{all to the}} top. But I'm glad we came, by Jove! I wouldn't {{have missed}} this for something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] said Rachel. [...] "You'd frighten Mrs. Sturt {{out of all}} her composure, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> the cream." [...] Then Rachel went off, and Rowan {{was again}} left with her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--yes. We've got along. Can {{you imagine}} any {{possible}} concatenation of {{circumstances in which}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>get</b> along? There's always too much good sense in the House for an absolute collapse. But are you contented?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's just an idea," [...] Forrest remarked carelessly. [...] "I wouldn't mind it myself, but I don't fancy <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> Engleton {{away from}} town before Goodwood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then ask {{his black}} majesty," [...] said Peterkin, [...] "as quick as you please, for, to say truth, I'm rather anxious on this point. I feel that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> on without a good interpreter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So have I; {{but he is}} not infallible. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> never <b>get</b> on in life if we {{gave way}} to groundless fears, dear wife. Besides, have we not the promise, `Lo, I am with you alway?'" ...|$|R
