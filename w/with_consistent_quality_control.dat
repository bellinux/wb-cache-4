40|$|Abstract—Typically, a video {{rate control}} {{algorithm}} minimizes the average distortion (denoted as MINAVE) {{at the cost}} of large temporal quality variation, especially for videos with high motion and frequent scene changes. To alleviate the negative effect on subjective video quality, another criterion that restricts a small amount of quality variation among adjacent frames is preferred for practical applications. As pointed out by [20], although some existing proposals can produce <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> videos, they often fail to fully utilize the available bits to minimize the global total distortion. In this paper, we would like to achieve the triple goal of <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> video, minimizing the total distortion, and meeting the bit budget strictly {{all at the same time}} on the interframe dependent coding structure. Two approaches are taken to accomplish this goal. In the first algorithm, a trellis-based framework is proposed. One of our contributions is to derive an equivalent condition between the distortion minimization problem and the budget minimization problem. Second, our trellis state (tree node) is defined in terms of distortion, which facilitates the <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> <b>control.</b> Third, by adjusting one key parameter in our algorithm, a solution in between the MINAVE and the constant quality criteria can be obtained. The second approach is to combine the Lagrange multipliers method together <b>with</b> the <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> <b>control.</b> The PSNR performance is degraded slightly but the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Simulation results show that both our approaches produce a much smaller PSNR variation at a slight average PSNR loss as compared to the MPEG JM rate control. When they are compared to the other <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> proposals, only the proposed algorithms can strictly meet the target bit budget requirement (no more, no less) and produce the largest average PSNR at a small PSNR variation.

40|$|Successful {{application}} {{with advanced}} fiber reinforced cement based materials relies on reliable design prescriptions and design-oriented test methodologies for {{the identification of}} relevant material properties, together <b>with</b> <b>consistent</b> and effective <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> procedures. The ‘‘randomly uniform’’ dispersion of fibers within a structural element is a crucial issue to be tackled, which, if not achieved, {{may lead to the}} activation of unanticipated failure mechanisms, thus lowering the load bearing capacity and jeopardizing the structural performance. It is henceforth evident that non-destructive techniques for fiber dispersion monitoring need to be developed and calibrated, as it {{has been going on for}} at least the last lustrum, and their outcomes to be effectively correlated to the mechanical performance of the material. In this paper a non-destructive method based on the magnetic properties of the composite has been applied to monitor the fiber dispersion and orientation in HPFRCC slabs. The results have been correlated to the tensile behaviour, measured according to the newly conceived ‘‘Double Edge Wedge Splitting’’ technique.

40|$|Reduction in ploidy to {{generate}} haploid gametes during sexual reproduction {{is accomplished by}} the specialized cell division program of meiosis. Pairing between homologous chromosomes and assembly of the synaptonemal complex at their interface (synapsis) represent intermediate steps in the meiotic program that are essential to form crossover recombination-based linkages between homologs, which in turn enable segregation of the homologs to opposite poles at the meiosis I division. Here, we challenge the mechanisms of pairing and synapsis during C. elegans meiosis by disrupting the normal 1 : 1 correspondence between homologs through karyotype manipulation. Using a combination of cytological tools, including S-phase labeling to specifically identify X chromosome territories in highly synchronous cohorts of nuclei and 3 D rendering to visualize meiotic chromosome structures and organization, our analysis of trisomic (triplo-X) and polyploid meiosis provides insight into the principles governing pairing and synapsis and how the meiotic program is "wired" to maximize successful sexual reproduction. We show that chromosomes sort into homologous groups regardless of chromosome number, then preferentially achieve pairwise synapsis {{during a period of}} active chromosome mobilization. Further, comparisons of synapsis configurations in triplo-X germ cells that are proficient or defective for initiating recombination suggest a role for recombination in restricting chromosomal interactions to a pairwise state. Increased numbers of homologs prolong markers of the chromosome mobilization phase and/or boost germline apoptosis, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> triggering <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms that promote resolution of synapsis problems and/or cull meiocytes containing synapsis defects. However, we also uncover evidence for the existence of mechanisms that "mask" defects, thus allowing resumption of prophase progression and survival of germ cells despite some asynapsis. We propose that coupling of saturable masking mechanisms with stringent <b>quality</b> <b>controls</b> maximizes meiotic success by making progression and survival dependent on achieving a level of synapsis sufficient for crossover formation without requiring perfect synapsis...|$|R

Treating proteins as fractal objects, without studying spatial conservation in positioning of particular residues in IgSF, this work probed the roots structural invariance of immunoglobulins(Ig). Symmetry in distribution of mass, hydrophobicity, polarizability recorded very similar extents in Ig and in structurally-closest non-Ig structures. They registered similar symmetries in dipole-dipole, π-π, cation-π cloud interactions and also in distribution of active chiral centers, charged residues and hydrophobic residues. But in contrast to non-Ig proteins, extents of residual interaction symmetries in Ig. s of largely varying sizes are found to converge to exactly same magnitude of correlation dimension - these are named 'structural attractors', who's weightages depend on ensuring exact convergence of pairwise-interaction symmetries to attractor magnitude. Small basin of attraction for Ig attractors explained the strict and <b>consistent</b> <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> in ensuring stability and functionality of IgSF proteins. Low dependency of attractor weightage on attractor magnitude demonstrated that residual-interaction symmetry with less pervasive nature can also be crucial in ensuring Ig stability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{visual quality}} {{consistency}} {{is one of}} the most important issues in video quality assessment (VQA). When people view a sequential video, they may have an unpleasant perceptual experience if the visual quality of video frames is inconsistent even though the average visual quality of the video is not too bad. Thus, the <b>consistent</b> visual <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> is mostly expected in real-time video communication. Additionally, in conventional video communication, the channel bandwidth and buffer resources are limited. The unfair distribution of encoding resources among video frames would result in not only inconsistent visual quality but also other types of spatial distortions. In this paper, a new objective visual quality metric (VQM) is firstly proposed for measuring the video quality in video coding. It makes full use of the information of video coding without extra computational complexity. Secondly, a visual <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is proposed to ensure the <b>consistent</b> visual <b>quality</b> of video coding under the given channel and buffer resources. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed VQM is <b>consistent</b> well <b>with</b> the human visual system (HVS). In addition, the <b>consistent</b> visual <b>quality,</b> better rate-distortion efficiency, accurate bit control and compliant buffer can be achieved by the proposed visual <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> algorithm.

We have developed a 'microarray meter' tool which assesses the inherent variations associated with microarray measurement prior to embarking on large scale projects.
