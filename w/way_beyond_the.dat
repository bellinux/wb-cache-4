25|$|In concerted {{playing in}} Bach's time the basso continuo, {{consisting}} of instruments such as organ, and/or {{viola da gamba}} and harpsichord, usually had the role of accompaniment: providing the harmonic and rhythmic foundation of a piece. From the late 1720s, Bach had the organ play concertante (i.e. as soloist) with the orchestra in instrumental cantata movements, a decade before Handel published his first organ concertos. Apart from the 5th Brandenburg Concerto and the Triple Concerto, which already had harpsichord soloists in the 1720s, Bach wrote and arranged his harpsichord concertos in the 1730s, and in his sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord neither instrument plays a continuo part: they are treated as equal soloists, <b>way</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> figured bass role. In this sense, Bach {{played a key role}} in the development of genres such as the keyboard concerto.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in 1906, William Castle [...] {{carried out}} a long study {{of the effect of}} {{selection}} on coat colour in rats.

He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found {{that it was possible to}} change the characteristics <b>way</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation could not be inherited permanently, requiring new mutations.
