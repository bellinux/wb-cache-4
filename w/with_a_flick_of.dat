5|$|The Queen {{is one of}} the Overtakers, villains of The Kingdom Keepers novel series. She was {{introduced}} in 2011 in the fourth book of the saga, Power Play, alongside Cruella De Vil. Like Maleficent, she is very powerful and is able to cast almost any spell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> her finger; she can also transform herself and other characters. In Power Play, when Maleficent and Chernabog are captured by the Keepers, the Queen becomes the new leader of the Overtakers.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
25|$|If the tubing label {{has been}} lost, a {{high-quality}} (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can {{be recognized by}} tapping it sharply <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5kg for frame and forks) {{and the type of}} lugs and fork ends used.|$|E
5000|$|Return boomerangs have a flat {{convex surface}} {{that must be}} thrown upright <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, but {{throwing}} sticks are thrown horizontally.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a crop is {{designed}} to allow enough leverage {{for it to be}} accelerated rapidly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> controlled <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist without causing the rider balancing problems. Thus, a true crop is relatively short.|$|R
60|$|A {{squirrel}} {{ran up and}} sat {{begging for}} a nut. Betty searched in the grass {{in the hope of}} finding one, but came upon nothing but shells. The squirrel bounded away, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disdainful <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the tail.|$|R
25|$|Mendis, {{although}} {{classified as}} slow-medium, bowls {{a mixture of}} deliveries, including googlies, off-breaks, top-spinners, flippers and leg-breaks, {{as well as the}} carrom ball, released <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his middle finger. For Sri Lanka Army in 2007–08 he averaged a mere 10.56 and took 46 wickets in six games, his strike rate a startling 31. This gained him a call-up to the full Sri Lanka squad for the Caribbean tour in April 2008.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist.|$|E
25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, {{and the potential for}} an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
5000|$|While running, {{push the}} ball firmly {{to the ground}} around 1.5-2m in front of them, angling the ball {{slightly}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist, so that it strikes the ground towards the end furthest from the player's body, tilted slightly downward.|$|R
60|$|She {{submitted}} prettily. Then, when {{he let her}} go, {{she began}} to skip, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> curious <b>flicking</b> up <b>of</b> one leg behind her.|$|R
50|$|Soukou is {{the leader}} of the Taiten- Gyoudou. He is {{extremely}} gentle, but extremely strong as well. He sends Taisou flying <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his finger. It is later revealed that his eyes have the power of the stars as well. Taisou follows this man rather blindly.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen {{has used}} a Steinberger GL-2T guitar with TransTrem on several songs, {{including}} [...] "Get Up" [...] and [...] "Summer Nights" [...] (from 5150). It was custom painted with the [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] graphics. He has also used Kramer and Peavey model guitars fitted with the Steinberger TransTrem unit. The Steinbeger {{is able to}} change the tuning of a guitar <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> a switch {{and be able to}} lock it there.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the {{malfunctioning}} sonic screwdriver {{is destroyed}} when the Doctor tries {{to signal the}} Atraxi ships. The Doctor later receives a new one, which emerges from the newly regenerated TARDIS console. The Eleventh Doctor's sonic screwdriver is larger than its predecessor; it has a green light and metal claws that extend <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist. It is shown to have been created by the TARDIS {{as part of its}} automatic regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|The Zune Pad, {{which is}} a squircle, is the primary control [...] for Zune 4, 8, 16, 80 and 120. The pad lets users of this device scroll through a long list <b>of</b> songs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few <b>flicks</b> <b>of</b> the finger, then press the button to select tracks or change the volume.|$|R
5000|$|The {{snap shot}} is a {{combination}} of both the slap-shot and the wrist shot. The shooter begins by cocking the stick back like <b>a</b> slap-shot (however <b>with</b> not such <b>an</b> exaggerated motion), and finishes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> the wrist like a wrist shot. The resulting shot has more speed than a wrist shot, while increasing {{the time it takes to}} release the shot, balancing its effectiveness. NHL players noted for their snap-shot include Joe Sakic, Ilya Kovalchuk, Phil Kessel, Thomas Vanek, Nathan Horton, Anže Kopitar, Vincent Lecavalier, Alexander Ovechkin, Mike Bossy and Dany Heatley. Many consider Joe Sakic to be the father of the modern snapshot, as he demonstrated incredible scoring ability while utilizing this quick-release shot throughout his career. He much preferred it to the wrist shot, which he was less known for. During his Career, Phil Kessel has perfected a variation of the snap shot where the player transfers their weight to their Puck foot, or [...] "back foot," [...] and shoot in stride. He has used this to become one of the leagues most dangerous shooters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{whole room}} {{would come to}} life with his conductingthe way he would look over at the drummer and <b>with</b> just <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his finger, things could happen. Once the groove was {{happening}} in the room, forget it; there was nothing like it. And everything, including the strings, responded to the kind of body movement that Burt had. He brings an incredible amount of life to the studio. He's {{probably one of the most}} amazing musicians in the world. —Record producer Phil Ramone ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2011, Stephen Fry's 100 Greatest Gadgets {{was shown}} on Channel 4 {{as one of}} the 100 Greatest strand. His choice for the {{greatest}} gadget was the cigarette lighter, which he described as [...] "fire <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the fingers". In the same month, the nature documentary series Ocean Giants, narrated by Fry, premiered. In September 2011, Fry's Planet Word, a five-part documentary about language, aired on BBC HD and BBC Two. In November 2011, an episode of Living The Life featured Fry in an intimate conversation discussing his life and career with Rolling Stones bass player Bill Wyman.|$|E
2500|$|Babo then draws a spot {{of blood}} from Don Benito <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his razor, an {{accident}} he calls [...] "Babo's first blood" [...] and blames on Don Benito's shaking. He then concludes Don Benito's toilette with a comb, as if {{to put on a}} show for Delano. Then, just when Delano has preceded the other two out of the cabin, Babo cuts himself in the cheek. On deck, he shows Delano the bleeding and explains that this is Don Benito's punishment for the accident. Delano is momentarily shocked by this Spanish cruelty, but when he sees Babo and Don Benito reconciled he is relieved to notice that the outrage has passed.|$|E
6000|$|Cruchot {{stroked his}} long moustaches reflectively. [...] "Well, well," [...] he said finally, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the whip at the off mule, [...] "so you don't know?" ...|$|E
50|$|The Arabian {{sand boa}} is largely nocturnal and is {{tolerant}} {{of a wide}} range of temperatures. During the day it buries itself deep in the sand but moves towards the surface at dusk. Here it remains slightly below the surface with just its eyes projecting, ready to pounce <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sideways <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> its head, on any small creature that happens to pass. Its prey includes short-fingered geckos (Stenodactylus spp.), the Baluch rock gecko (Bunopus tuberculatus), and worm lizards.|$|R
25|$|In October 2013, Murphy won {{his second}} Donegal Senior Football Championship as Glenswilly {{defeated}} Killybegs by 3–19 to 2–6. Murphy scored 1–5 {{and set up}} Ciaran Bonner's goal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deft <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the heel. Murphy played less than 24 hours after captaining Ireland in the first 2013 International Rules Test win against Australia. Glenswilly progressed to the final of that year's Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, which they lost to Ballinderry, despite Murphy opening the scoring <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goal after 25 seconds and later assisting Caolan Kelly for a second.|$|R
2500|$|The Gypsy horse has {{distinct}} gaits. According to GHA's standard, [...] "The stride {{should be}} correct, supple, and powerful.

6000|$|Kitty was {{immediately}} interested. She threw down her own rod, and assisted her ignorant companion. A wretched little fish {{appeared in the}} air, wriggling. [...] "It's a roach," [...] Kitty pronounced. [...] "It's in pain," [...] the merciful lawyer added; [...] "give it to me." [...] Kitty took it off the hook, and obeyed. Mr. Sarrazin with humane gentleness of handling put {{it back into the}} water. [...] "Go, and God bless you," [...] said this excellent man, as the roach disappeared joyously <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> its tail. Kitty was scandalized. [...] "That's not sport!" [...] she said. [...] "Oh, yes, it is," [...] he answered--"sport to the fish." ...|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{glanced over}} his shoulder, and saw Pancho, his major‐domo, {{standing}} half dressed not far behind him with a lantern and a big machete in his hand. He stooped, picked up the knife, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his fingers slid it into his sleeve. Then he held the lantern higher, and Appleby recognized his adversary as a weight clerk in the sugar mill. He blinked with his eyes, and the damp dripped from his face, which showed haggard and drawn; but Appleby, who wondered if his own wore that look, surmised {{that this was not}} due to cowardice, and understood why the man breathed in gasps.|$|E
40|$|I had {{the luck}} of the Devil, you might say. Every player in my casino knew of me and my skills at the poker table. Yet even with such skills, I felt {{something}} shift inside me when I noticed Mac wasn’t dealing at my usual table. Mac dealt for me and no one else. With-out Mac and his habit of rigging the decks, the casino closed in around me. The newbie shuffled her cards <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relaxed <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wrist.

50|$|Its {{flight is}} quick, {{performed}} by regular beats, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> occasional sharp <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the wings, <b>a</b> characteristic of pigeons in general.

During the circling spring flight the wings are smartly cracked like a whip.|$|R
60|$|They threw {{twice more}} {{while the other}} man, who {{appeared}} to relinquish his share in the proceedings, good-humoredly looked on, and then Lister leaned forward suddenly and seized the yellow hand. The box fell with a clatter, and Lister clutched {{one of the little}} spotted cubes that rolled out upon the table. Then the player's companion swung out his right arm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his sleeve, and Lister caught the gleam of steel. Loosely hung and a trifle slouching as he was, he was big, and had, at least, no lack of animal courage. He said nothing, but he flung the man whose hand he held backward upon the table, which overturned in front of his companion, and snatching a heavy wine flask from one close by, swung it by the neck.|$|E
6000|$|It {{became clear}} to me as if for the first time, that I was really parting from my aunt Susan. I went out on to the {{pavement}} and saw her head craned forward, her wide-open blue eyes and her little face intent on the shop that had combined for her all the charms of a big doll's house and a little home of her very own. [...] "Good-bye!" [...] she said to it and to me. Our eyes met for a moment--perplexed. My uncle bustled out and gave a few totally unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in beside her. [...] "All right?" [...] asked the driver. [...] "Right," [...] said I; and he woke up the horse <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his whip. My aunt's eyes surveyed me again.

50|$|In a {{match between}} two already-eliminated teams, Spain went in {{front in the}} 36th minute after Andrés Iniesta {{threaded}} a pass down the right to overlapping full-back Juanfran, who then crossed the ball low to David Villa to finish <b>with</b> <b>a</b> back <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> his right foot low to the net. In the second half, Fernando Torres scored Spain's second <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low finish from {{the left of the}} penalty area after a pass from Iniesta, before substitute Juan Mata, receiving a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, scored from the right of the penalty area <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low shot between the goalkeeper's legs.|$|R
30|$|Chaetognaths are ambush predators {{using the}} fans of hair present over their body surface as {{distance}} mechanoreceptors (Horridge and Boulton 1967). Mobile prey that, through a distinctive signal, elicit the sensory hairs are attacked: the chaetognath makes <b>a</b> bout <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rapid <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> the tail, the prey is blocked with the grasping spines and swallowed (Feigenbaum 1991). Adult copepods and copepodites {{are the main}} food resource of adult chaetognaths (Øresland 1987), while younger developmental stages may prefer copepod nauplii (Feigenbaum 1991); on occasion, cladocerans can become the mainstay of chaetognaths (Kehayias and Ntakou 2008; Kehayias and Kourouvakalis 2010).|$|R
