It's tough, and it's painful, and it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> growing up, and it is for most people."

In an interview with Los Angeles Magazine, Dickinson recalled the process of pitching her book to Regan: [...] "I got a book deal without even turning in one shred of a writing sample. I was having an invincible moment. I told her how difficult it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> growing up with an abusive father, how when I went to New York to become a model I was rejected for a year for being 'too ethnic.'

I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E

It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, all he wanted <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to hear his side of the story, which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps {{to make sure that he}} was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E

Henri Langlois screened the studio version of Greed for von Stroheim in 1950. Von Stroheim said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> an exhumation. It was like opening a coffin in which there was just dust, giving off a terrible stench, a couple of vertebra and a piece of shoulder bone." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It was as if a man's beloved was run over by a truck, maimed beyond recognition. He goes to see her in the morgue.

500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes {{a long time to get}} there, and arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E
500|$|According to AllMusic, {{the album}} is mostly {{influenced}} by dance-pop, post-disco and pop rock music. The overall sound of Madonna is dissonant, {{and is in the}} form of upbeat synthetic disco, utilizing some of the new technology of the time, like the usage of Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the [...] This equipment has dated since, consequently the sound of the album comes off as somewhat harsh. Madonna commented on her debut album: [...] "The songs were pretty weak and I went to England during the recordings so I wasn't around... I wasn't in control. [...] I didn't realize how crucial it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to break out of the disco mold before I'd already finished the [...] album. I wish I could have got a little more variety there." [...] The album starts with the song [...] "Lucky Star", a medium-paced dance track, beginning with a sparkle of synth note and is followed by heavy beats of electronic drum and handclaps. A guitar is played in high riff and a bubbling bass synth is produced to accompany the guitar sound. The song revolves around the [...] "Starlight, starbright" [...] hook for more than a minute, before going to the chorus. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics are repetitive and inane, revolving around the transparent ambiguity of the stars, and juxtaposition of the male character with being a heavenly body in the sky.|$|E

And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything."

In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to make a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three}} years and I met them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E
