5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam {{opened a}} {{campaign}} against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and {{decided to return to}} Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his party inadvertently encountered a band of Kurdish brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Creek {{marked the}} end of the campaign. Hayes was {{promoted}} to brigadier general in October 1864 and brevetted major general. Around this time, Hayes learned of the birth of his son, George Crook Hayes. The army went into winter quarters once more, and in spring 1865 the war quickly came to a close with Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. Hayes visited Washington, D.C. that May and observed the Grand Review of the Armies, after <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the 23rd Ohio returned to their home state to be mustered out of the service.|$|E

5|$|Growing {{weary of}} his workload, Gray {{and his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the funding sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E

Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set in the lab, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> others claim was the first to be built in the state of Georgia.

Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E

Three days later, on 21 June, came the Paris premiere of Dialogues des Carmélites at the Opéra. It was a tremendous success, to the composer's considerable relief.

The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his family had already abandoned.

5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common.

5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested much {{of their}} time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education.

In 1821 Champollion even led an uprising, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag.
