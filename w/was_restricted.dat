5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The {{mainline}} <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961.

40|$|I {{describe}} several computational complexity {{results for}} planning, {{some of which}} identify tractable planning problems. The model of planning, called &quot;propositional planning, &quot; is simple—conditions within operators are literals with no variables allowed. The different planning problems are defined by different restrictions on the preconditions and postconditions of operators. The main results are: Propositional planning is PSPACE-complete, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to two positive (nonnegated) preconditions and two postconditions, or if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to one postcondition (with any number of preconditions). It is NP-complete if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to positive postconditions, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to one precondition and one positive postcondition. It is tractable in a few restricted cases, {{one of which is}} if each operator <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to positive preconditions and one postcondition. The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. ...|$|R

5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{at the start}} of 1986–87, Gibbs <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> to 18 appearances as his team finished the season 9th in the First Division.

Gibbs lost his place shortly before Bassett's departure in January, and although he soon returned to the side under Steve Harrison, Watford were relegated in 1988. At the time of the club's relegation, Gibbs had made precisely 100 First Division appearances.|$|E
