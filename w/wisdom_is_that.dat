500|$|More recent sources {{indicate}} that White scores approximately 54 to 56 percent. In 2005, GM Jonathan Rowson wrote that [...] "the conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> White begins {{the game with}} a small advantage and, holding all other factors constant, scores approximately 56% to Black's 44%". International Master (IM) John Watson wrote in 1998 that White had scored 56% for most of the 20th century, but that this figure had recently slipped to 55%. The website Chessgames.com holds regularly updated statistics on its games database. As of January 12, 2015, White had won 37.50%, 34.90% were drawn, and Black had won 27.60% out of 739,769 games, resulting in a total White winning percentage of 54.95%.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the summer}} {{seasonal}} jobs end, just as with the winter dump months, and younger moviegoers begin to return to school. Tuition payments, and retailers' back-to-school sales further cut into movie grosses. [...] "The prevailing <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people don't go to the movies in August" [...] due to family vacations, summer camp, among other factors, Vulture complained as it pondered another potentially dreary month in 2008. While an August release can open as successfully as a film earlier in the summer, [...] "t just doesn't have the ability to run five or six weeks so there's a scramble for June and July," [...] Ted Mundorff, head of Landmark Theatres, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in 2014. The type of films that interest younger audiences in the early summer, he elaborates, do not do well after Labor Day.|$|E
50|$|The {{tree was}} well-loved {{in spite of}} its {{association}} with the examination period in November when jacarandas all over Sydney come into flower.

50|$|Prior to the Dec. rate hike he {{predicted}} {{that if the}} Fed raised rates {{the price of gold}} would rise. The conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it would fall.

50|$|Amid many {{distinguished}} male graduates was one woman. In an {{era when}} the prevailing conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no woman could withstand the intellectual and emotional rigors of a medical education, Elizabeth Blackwell, (1821-1910) applied to and was rejected - or simply ignored - by 29 medical schools before being admitted in 1847 to the Medical Institution of Geneva College.|$|R
500|$|Dragon Quest {{has become}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it {{is used as a}} common topic for conversation in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan's national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that [...] "the common <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if you ask someone from Japan to draw 'Slime,' he'll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game." [...] With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida's Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public house like its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool's Hoax, Google announced a [...] "NES version" [...] of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest.|$|E

6000|$|We may puzzle {{our minds}} with these {{and a hundred}} more curious questions, as learned men have done in all ages. But--shall we become really the wiser by so doing? More learned we may become. But being learned and being wise are two {{different}} things. True <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which makes a man a better man. And will such puzzling questions and calculations as these, settle them how we may, make us BETTER men? Will they make us more honest and just, more generous and loving, more able to keep our tempers and control our appetites? I cannot see that. Will it make us better men merely {{to know that there}} was once a flood of waters on the earth? I cannot see that. If we look at the hills of sand and gravel round us, a little common sense will show us that there have been many floods of waters on the earth, long, long before the one of which the Bible speaks: but shall we be better men for knowing that either? I cannot see why we should. Now the Bible was sent to make us better men. How then will the history of the flood do that? ...|$|E

50|$|For example, {{received}} <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> New Labour is {{all about}} spin, so the panel will try to argue that New Labour is not all about spin, and the guests {{have to try to}} make the audience change their minds.|$|E
2500|$|Redi is {{best known}} for his series of experiments, {{published}} in 1668 as Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degli Insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), which is regarded as his masterpiece and a milestone in the history of modern science.

50|$|Joining a squad that, in {{addition}} to new head coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, also featured plenty of new faces, the conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such circumstances would work in Pančev's favour in terms of fitting in. His competitors for places upfront were all new arrivals as well: Uruguayan Rubén Sosa who came from Lazio, the Italian 1990 World Cup hero Salvatore Schillaci who came from Juventus, and, depending on formation, even Russian attacking midfielder Igor Shalimov who came from Foggia.|$|R
2500|$|Australian cricket {{during the}} 1980s was {{comparatively}} unsuccessful, particularly following {{the retirement of}} players such as Marsh and Lillee.

For quite some time, the common <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Australia's score in an innings would be [...] "Border plus 100". Border achieved the feat of scoring more than 150 runs in both innings of a Test during a tour of Pakistan during this decade.|$|R
5000|$|Accepted <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "when {{it comes}} to issues of {{emotional}} importance, convincing someone to change his or her existing beliefs {{appears to be a}} virtually hopeless undertaking."

5000|$|Another {{indicator}} of the deficiency of the original translation as The Joyful <b>Wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the German Wissenschaft never indicates [...] "wisdom" [...] (wisdom = Weisheit), but a propensity toward any rigorous practice of a poised, controlled, and disciplined quest for knowledge, and is typically translated as [...] "science".|$|E

40|$|Once upon a time, {{law professors}} and {{political}} scientists {{assumed that the}} Supreme Court was, as a practical matter, the final word on matters of statutory interpretation. Although Congress as a formal matter could alter a judicial construction with a statutory amendment, the conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it rarely did so. In 1991, <b>that</b> conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> shattered by one of our 2 ̆ 7 s empirical study demonstrating that congressional overrides of Supreme Court statutory interpretation decisions blossomed in the period between 1967 and 1990.

5000|$|Within his constraints, a serf {{had some}} freedoms. Though the common <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a serf owned [...] "only his belly"—even {{his clothes were}} the property, in law, of his lord—a serf might still {{accumulate}} personal property and wealth, and some serfs became wealthier than their free neighbours, although this happened rarely.

50|$|Most organisations {{providing}} {{urban water}} services in Australia have experienced {{some degree of}} organisational reform in the 1990s, which has clarified accountabilities by separating policy, regulatory and commercial (operational) functions.

50|$|Memory {{barriers}} are low-level primitives {{and part of}} an architecture's memory model, which, like instruction sets, vary considerably between architectures, {{so it is not}} appropriate to generalize about memory barrier behavior. The conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> using memory barriers correctly requires careful study of the architecture manuals for the hardware being programmed.

5000|$|Marketing [...] is {{the number}} 1 problem for contractors, more so than estimating, administration, accounting, or {{managing}} sub trades.

50|$|An inflation-targeting {{central bank}} will raise or lower {{interest}} rates based on above-target or below-target inflation, respectively. The conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> raising interest rates usually cools the economy to rein in inflation; lowering interest rates usually accelerates the economy, thereby boosting inflation. The first three countries to implement fully-fledged inflation targeting were New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, although Germany had adopted many elements of inflation targeting earlier.|$|E
40|$|With {{the economy}} {{dominating}} today’s headlines and conversations {{it is hard}} to remember <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> preoccupied with economic events during the last decade, too. The 1990 s were mostly a time of tremendous growth and innovation, but they were not without their own trials and crises. In fact, the conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only one man truly understood what was happening, and he was leading the economy to prosperity amidst the perils of capitalism.

5000|$|All of {{the early}} models were {{designed}} by Naim founder Julian Vereker, who wanted equipment that he himself and friends could enjoy listing through.

Received <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> amplifiers <b>were</b> [...] "straight wires with gain" [...] that had no effect on the sound. But through auditioning Vereker determined that the performance of amplifiers on the market ranged from bad to abysmal.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} <b>wisdom</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his delegates {{would break}} at least 2:1 {{in favour of}} Mulroney over Clark. The conventional wisdom played out, and Mulroney was elected on the fourth ballot and declared the winner.A poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark's home province of Alberta, and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney's home province of Quebec. Mulroney's strong showing amongst Ontario delegates (65% to 34%) seemed to account {{for most of his}} margin of victory.|$|R
