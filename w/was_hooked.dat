The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs.

25|$|Moran's first {{boat was}} {{purchased}} in the 1940s; a 19-foot Chris-Craft. From that point, he <b>was</b> <b>hooked.</b> Boats and entertaining on them was Jim Moran's passion. In his lifetime, he owned more than 200, including models from Burger, Wellcraft Scarab, Hatteras, Sea Ray, Rybovich and multimillion-dollar motor yachts from Feadship. In 1983, he asked Feadship {{to design a}} boat {{large enough to be}} seaworthy for ocean cruising but elegant for entertaining business associates. Over the next 20+ years, Moran commissioned seven more vessels from the company, culminating in the 168' Gallant Lady in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 Yellow Grass {{town council}} passed a bylaw to {{appropriate}} $10,000 {{to build the}} first power plant in the town. The plant was an oil-burning 25 horsepower (19 kilowatt) direct current electrical generator. The town quickly outgrew the plant, and by 1920 a more economical coal-fired plant was built. In 1928 the plant was sold to the Montreal Engineering Company, and the town <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> into the Soo Line power grid. The electric company went {{through a number of}} changes over the next couple decades before becoming part of the Saskatchewan Power Commission, which is today known as SaskPower and supplies electricity to the entire province.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, Van Cise made it well known he was going on a long fishing {{vacation}} to the Rocky Mountains, signaling to the gang members that the heat was off their operation. While the con men plied their trade openly {{on the streets of}} Denver, Van Cise and his assistants plotted a huge roundup that required a willing victim to help catch the gang in the act. With incredible good fortune, J. Frank Norfleet showed up in Denver at precisely this moment. Norfleet was a Texas rancher who had previously been scammed twice by other gangs and was on a nationwide manhunt to bring the men who swindled him to justice. Entering the lobby of the Brown Palace Hotel, Norfleet <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> by unwitting gang members who saw him as an easy mark, and the plan was set in motion.|$|E

25|$|The Mle 1915 was a {{conventional}} design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield {{to protect the}} crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A loading tray was hinged {{to the left side}} of the cradle. It was swung into position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled limber was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the limber. For (slow) motor-traction no limber was necessary and the trail <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> directly to the tractor.|$|E

One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E

Hill took her first trip to Yosemite, a central destination for climbers, at the age of 16, where she was introduced to the climbers at Camp 4. There she met Charlie Row, her first boyfriend. Their romance flourished; with him she climbed her first 5.11 and first big wall.|$|E

500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E

[...] Moore <b>was</b> <b>hooked.</b> He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother.

500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and <b>was</b> <b>hooked</b> to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E

I still get it every time I get into a race car." [...] Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior [...] in Ancona, Italy when he was thirteen years old. However, the [...] Formula Junior story is likely apocryphal. In an interview during an , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother, Aldo, and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy.|$|E
500|$|Several {{unconfirmed}} {{reports of}} great white sharks caught {{in modern times}} with have been estimated {{to be more than}} [...] long, but these claims have received some criticism. However, J.E. Randall believed that great white shark may have exceeded [...] in length. A great white shark was captured near Kangaroo Island in Australia on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than [...] long by Peter Resiley, and has been designated as KANGA. Another great white shark was caught in Malta by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987. This shark was also estimated to be around [...] long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA. However, Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.E. Randall to suggest that the KANGA specimen was [...] long. In a similar fashion, I.K. Fergusson also used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.E. Randall to suggest that the MALTA specimen was [...] long. However, photographic evidence suggested that these specimens were larger than the size estimations yielded through Randall's methods. Thus, a team of scientists—H.F. Mollet, G.M. Cailliet, A.P. Klimley, D.A. Ebert, A.D. Testi, and L.J.V. Compagno—reviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive morphometric analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P.Resiley and J.Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out. A particularly large female great white nicknamed [...] "Deep Blue", estimated measuring at [...] was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of Shark Week [...] "Jaws Strikes Back". Deep Blue would also later gain significant attention when she was filmed interacting with researcher Mauricio Hoyas Pallida in a viral video that Mauricio posted on Facebook on 11 June 2015. A particularly infamous great white shark, supposedly of record proportions, once patrolled the area that comprises False Bay, South Africa, was said to be well over [...] during the early 1980s. This shark, known locally as the [...] "Submarine", had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well founded. Though rumors have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether, witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira, a notable shark expert in South Africa, and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it <b>was</b> <b>hooked).</b> Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book [...] "Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior".|$|E
