Arthur sought out Ranger as someone with [...] "moral guts", who would take [...] "a stand against the type of operations we were engaged in".

40|$|Abstract When low growth started {{since the}} first oil crises, the {{importance}} of the R&D section was re-estimated for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of chemical corporations in Japan. A new business isn’t achieved easily if there is no cooperation with R&D. To connect research with product development directly, the R&D section was put in the business section. As a result, the disorganization of Central Research Institute had to be measured. And the ratio of corporate research has decreased, too. In this paper the history of the R&D system of Tokuyama Corp. is analyzed. The existence of a leader who can adopt the best investment is important; Yuuji Fujii, director in the planning division, succeeded polysilicon business. He was both an engineer and a manager, and his standpoint worked effectively. He organized the project team, and this business was completed from the start for three years. Though the process from R&D to a new business is difficult, it is not to be done spending a long time. This is a case shown that the concentration in a short term is good. And it is <b>worth</b> bringing up <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of talents through forcibly researching, developing and making the business...|$|R
