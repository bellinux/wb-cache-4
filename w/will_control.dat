5|$|In Resident Evil 5, {{the primary}} player {{controls}} Redfield, whom Alomar follows throughout {{the game as}} an ally controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). In the game's co-operative gameplay mode, a second player <b>will</b> <b>control</b> Alomar. When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. During {{the events of the}} game, Alomar and Redfield stop the Tricell corporation, who were continuing Umbrella's work, from infecting the world with a new BOW. In the end, they kill the series' villain Albert Wesker.|$|E

The national government <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the destination of the resources and guarantees transparency in the whole spending process. According to the minister, Colombia should already have reached full drinking water coverage, given the past investments in the sector.|$|E

5|$|After the Black Order is rebuilt, Lenalee and {{her friends}} learn Allen is the vessel of the 14th Noah; {{eventually}} the Noah <b>will</b> <b>control</b> his body forcing the other exorcists to kill him if he becomes a Noah. Later, when Allen is imprisoned because of his transformations and escapes from the Order {{with the other two}} Noah, Lenalee tries to make him return. However, she fails as Allen confirms he still considers the Order his home before his departure. Three months later, Lenalee tries to conceal Yu Kanda's journey to find Allen from Komui. When Allen's mind is about to disappear from his body {{as a result of the}} Noah, Lenalee appears in an illusion allowing him to regain his desire to live.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn <b>will</b> <b>control</b> our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|In the {{governor}}'s absence, or if {{the governor}} dies or is unable to perform the executive duties, the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico takes control of the executive position, as Acting Governor during a temporary absence or inability, and as Governor in case of death, resignation or impeachment and conviction. The elected governor must designate a number of secretaries and other agency heads that <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the individual administrative agencies during his time in office, the selected secretaries {{are in charge of}} the island's health, natural resources, economy, correctional and judicial agencies and the department of consumer concerns, among others. The Governor's four-year term begins on January 2, the day after the New Year's Day holiday.|$|E

Special teams quality <b>control</b> <b>will</b> figure out what players are used in various special situations such as kickoff and punt.|$|R
25|$|Moving light {{programs}} are often {{much more complex}} than that of stationary instruments. While {{it is possible to}} operate them with any console that uses the DMX512 Protocol, many lighting board operators find a console dedicated to moving light operation to be much more efficient. Oftentimes there will be encoder wheels which <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the Pan, Tilt, Focus, Zoom, Color, and Effects. Many people find visualization software (such as WYSWIG, VectorWorks, and others) to be helpful when programming while other people prefer a hard tactile control.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernization}} of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system – which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room – rather than a fixed block system. This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems.|$|E
25|$|Some predators, such as dolphins, hunt {{in groups}} of their own. One {{technique}} employed by many dolphin species is herding, where a pod <b>will</b> <b>control</b> a school of fish while individual members take turns ploughing through and feeding on the more tightly-packed school (a formation commonly known as a bait ball.) Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin takes this one step further with what {{has become known as}} strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.|$|E

25|$|About {{halfway through}} the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to {{consider}} two different {{ways of looking at}} the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|Group {{practice}} {{is the most}} traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists <b>will</b> <b>control</b> a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and clinical pathology, which allows them to supervise blood banks, clinical chemistry laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.|$|E
25|$|In coxless pairs, quadruple sculls and coxless fours, {{one of the}} rowers will be {{designated}} to steers. They <b>will</b> <b>control</b> the rudder using lines attached to the toe of one shoe, which pivots around the ball of the foot. The rower who steers is chosen according to experience {{and the nature of}} the course on which the boat is rowing: bow has a clear view ahead when looking over one's shoulder, whereas stroke may be able to steer well on a straight course by pointing the stern at a reference point. A rower steering in the middle of a four or quad is not uncommon, since bow and stroke have other duties already.|$|E
