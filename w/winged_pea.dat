The sequential application of the glycosidases (neuraminidase, alpha-L-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase and alpha-mannosidase) and lectins (peanut, <b>winged</b> <b>pea,</b> wheat germ and soybean) seem promising as an effective method for characterising, in situ, the structure of complex carbohydrate chains. The data obtained after digestion with neuraminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase indicate {{the presence of a}} continuous layer of sialoglycoconjugates and fucoglycoconjugates that completely covers the luminal surfaces of the ampulla. The different reactivity of the glycocalyx and the secretory products indicates a different chemical composition of glycoconjugates in the glycocalyx and secretions. Although {{it is very difficult to}} explain the lectin affinity and the functional significance of the positive cells, some hypotheses have been advanced...|$|E

40|$|Grain legumes such as soya beans, {{groundnuts}} {{and common}} beans are major world crops. Others, such as cow peas lentils and mung beans are regionally important, especially in hot areas, {{where they are}} rapidly increasing in economic significance. There is considerable scope for improving and stabilising the yields of all these crops and international research on them has expanded dramatically {{over the past few}} years. An 880 -page reference book, entitled Grain Legume Crops brings together the results of national and international research on the subject. It has been compiled from the work of forty-nine leading experts in the field and aims to present the latest information in one volume. The first part of the book covers the following topics: general relations, taxonomy of grain legumes, domestication and evaluation, biochemical and nutritional attributes, rhizobium, nodulation and nitrogen fixation. The second part deals with thirteen individual species of grain legume: pea, faba bean, lentil, chick pea, soya bean, common bean, lima bean, cowpea, mung bean, <b>winged</b> bean, pigeon <b>pea,</b> lupin and groundnut. The book also contains an appendix on recent trends in internationally-orientated research on grain legumes.

The antioxidant potential of 75 % methanol extract, ethyl acetate and chloroform soluble fractions of P. tetragonolobus was screened for in-vitro antioxidant activity using total phenolic content, ferric reducing power, 2, 2 ’-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assay, Ferric Thiocyanate (FTC) and Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA) tests. It was found that ethyl acetate fraction have maximum amount of polyphenolics compounds (1. 69 mg/g GAE in concentration 0. 5 mg/mL) higher than methanol and chloroform fractions. Antioxidant concentration was found highest in ethyl acetate extract (27. 12 mM) using FRAP method, while chloroform extract has the highest antioxidant level (4. 48 mM) using ABTS assay. Ethyl acetate extract of P. tetragonolobus was found to have highest antioxidant activity (7. 27 %) compared to methanol and chloroform using FTC method.

40|$|The gastric glands of Triturus carnifex (Amphibia, Caudata) {{have been}} {{examined}} by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods with particular regard to hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen secretion. Fundic glands consist of mucous neck cells, endocrine cells and oxynticopeptic cells producing both pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid. The neck cells showed an unexpected distribution pattern which was only observed in the oral fundus, and produced neutral mucins with glycosidic residues of GalNAc and Gal b 1, 3 GalNAc, and in this respect they differ from the neck cells of anuran amphibians. The secretion of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid as demonstrated by immunolabelling with anti-H,K-ATPase and with anti-pepsinogen, respectively, seems not to vary significantly along the longitudinal axis of the stomach. The mechanism of gastric acid secretion seems to be mediated by an ATPase, having similar features to the mammalian gastric H,K-ATPase, and is localised in the luminal membrane and in the subapical cytoplasm of the oxynticopeptic cells. Unusually, the same cytoplasmic areas revealed binding specificity for the <b>winged</b> <b>pea</b> lectin (WPA) from Lotus tetragonolobus, even after b elimination, indicating the presence of fucosyl residues in N-linked oligosaccharidic chains in glycoproteins of b-H,K-ATPase subunits...|$|E
