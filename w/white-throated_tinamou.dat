50|$|The <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Tinamus guttatus) is {{a species}} of bird native to the Amazon {{rainforest}} of Brazil, northern Bolivia, southeastern Colombia, northeastern Ecuador, eastern Peru and southern Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The black tinamou has a tremulous and {{descending}} whistle lasting {{about one}} second. The whistle {{is similar to}} that of a <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou,</b> even sharing the same first note.|$|E
50|$|Some birds {{described}} by Pelzeln are the orange-breasted thornbird, the spot-winged antbird, the red-legged tinamou, the <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou,</b> the short-billed leaftosser, the yellow-margined flatbill and the New Zealand rockwren.|$|E
50|$|All {{tinamous}} {{are from}} the family Tinamidae {{and members of the}} infraclass Palaeognathae. Tinamous are the only members from their infraclass that aren't ratites, and can even fly, albeit poorly. All paleognaths evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds. The <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{is a member of the}} genus Tinamus, which consists of some of the larger tinamous, the <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> being the smallest member of the genus. It was first described by Austrian ornithologist August von Pelzeln in 1863. It is a monotypic species, meaning it doesn't branch off into subspecies.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{relatively}} abundant species in its habitat and the main threat to it is deforestation. As of 2012 {{the status of the}} <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> is Near Threatened, and it has a range occurrence of 4000000 km2. Its eggs are prized possessions to some collectors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name for the}} <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou,</b> Tinamus guttatus, originates from two different languages. Tinamus was the name given to the tinamou by the Kalina people. Guttatus means [...] "speckled" [...] in Latin. This may be {{in reference to the}} yellowish-white spots on a white-throated tinamou's lower back.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> has chestnut-brown upperparts with blackish {{streaking}} {{on lower}} back and small yellowish-white spots. It has paler underparts with wider, dark barring on flanks. It has a grey head and neck, {{with a white}} throat, brown eye, and brown bill. These birds measure between 32 and 36 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|Like other tinamous, the <b>white-throated</b> <b>tinamou</b> eats fruit off {{the ground}} or low-lying bushes, as well as invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from {{as many as four}} {{different}} females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually two to three weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} modern birds {{are among the}} most challenging to understand in systematic biology and have been debated for centuries. To address this challenge, we assembled or collected the genomes of 48 avian species spanning most orders of birds, including all Neognathae and two of the five Palaeognathae orders, and used the genomes to construct a genome-scale avian phylogenetic tree and perform comparative genomics analyses (Jarvis et al. in press; Zhang et al. in press). Here we release assemblies and datasets associated with the comparative genome analyses, which include 38 newly sequenced avian genomes plus previously released or simultaneously released genomes of Chicken, Zebra finch, Turkey, Pigeon, Peregrine falcon, Duck, Budgerigar, Adelie penguin, Emperor penguin and the Medium Ground Finch. We hope that this resource will serve future efforts in phylogenomics and comparative genomics. FINDINGS The 38 bird genomes were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and assembled using a whole genome shotgun strategy. The 48 genomes were categorized into two groups according to the N 50 scaffold size of the assemblies: a high depth group comprising 23 species sequenced at high coverage (> 50 X) with multiple insert size libraries resulting in N 50 scaffold sizes greater than 1  Mb (except the <b>White-throated</b> <b>Tinamou</b> and Bald Eagle); and a low depth group comprising 25 species sequenced at a low coverage (30 X) with two insert size libraries resulting in an average N 50 scaffold size of about 50  kb.

40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that thymus is a targeted immune organ in malnutrition, and high-boron stress is harmful for immune organs. African ostrich is the living fossil of ancient {{birds and the}} food animals in modern life. There is no report {{about the effect of}} boron intake on thymus of ostrich. The purpose of present study was to evaluate the effect of excessive boron stress on ostrich thymus and the potential role of TLR 3 / 4 signals in this process. Histological analysis demonstrated that long-term boron stress (640 mg/L for 90 days) did not disrupt ostrich thymic structure during postnatal development. However, the numbers of apoptotic cells showed an increased tendency, and the expression of autophagy and proliferation markers increased significantly in ostrich thymus after boron treatment. Next, we examined the expression of TLR 3 and TLR 4 with their downstream molecular in thymus under boron stress. Since ostrich genome was not available when we started the research, we first cloned ostrich TLR 3 TLR 4 cDNA from thymus. Ostrich TLR 4 was close to <b>white-throated</b> <b>Tinamou.</b> Whole avian TLR 4 codons were under purify selection during evolution, whereas 80 codons were under positive selection. TLR 3 and TLR 4 were expressed in ostrich thymus and bursa of fabricius as was revealed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). TLR 4 expression increased with age but significantly decreased after boron treatment, whereas TLR 3 expression showed the similar tendency. Their downstream molecular factors (IRF 1, JNK, ERK, p 38, IL- 6 and IFN) did not change significantly in thymus, except that p 100 was significantly increased under boron stress when analyzed by qRT-PCR or western blot. Taken together, these results suggest that ostrich thymus developed resistance against long-term excessive boron stress, possibly by accelerating intrathymic cell death and proliferation, which may bypass the TLR 3 / 4 pathway. In addition, attenuated TLRs activity may explain the reduced inflammatory response to pathogens under boron stress...|$|E

Repetitive elements comprised 4 %- 22 % of the bird genomes. The assembled scaffolds allowed the homology-based annotation of 13, 000 [*]~[*] 17000 protein coding genes in each avian genome relative to chicken, zebra finch and human, as well as comparative and sequence conservation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Here we release full genome assemblies of 38 newly sequenced avian species, link genome assembly downloads for the 7 of the remaining 10 species, and provide a guideline of genomic data that has been generated and used in our Avian Phylogenomics Project. To the best of our knowledge, the Avian Phylogenomics Project is the biggest vertebrate comparative genomics project to date. The genomic data presented here is expected to accelerate further analyses in many fields, including phylogenetics, comparative genomics, evolution, neurobiology, development biology, and other related areas...|$|E
