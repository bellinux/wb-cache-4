5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E

Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal.

Later on, Doggett approaches Regali. Regali tells him a [...] "hypothetical" [...] story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home. A [...] "businessman" [...] then <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the incident, realized that the boy has seen his face, and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime.

500|$|On Easter weekend 1991, Kennedy {{was at a}} get-together at the family's Palm Beach, Florida, estate when, {{restless and}} maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son Patrick and nephew William Kennedy Smith to {{accompany}} him. Patrick Kennedy and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman. [...] Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> her and Patrick, dressed only in a nightshirt and with a weird look on his face. Smith and Bowman {{went out on the}} beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual and she said was rape. The local police made a delayed investigation; soon Kennedy sources were feeding the press with negative information about Bowman's background and several mainstream newspapers broke a taboo by publishing her name. The case quickly became a media frenzy. While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on The Tonight Show and other late-night television programs. Time magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a [...] "Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque" [...] while Newsweek said Kennedy was [...] "the living symbol of the family flaws".|$|E

Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she put so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience.

2500|$|His first pop/soul single was [...] "Lovable" [...] (1956), {{a remake}} of the gospel song [...] "Wonderful".

However, it fooled no one—Cooke's unique and distinctive vocals were easily recognized. Art Rupe, head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and producer Bumps Blackwell were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, Little Richard. When Rupe <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a recording session and heard Cooke covering Gershwin, he was quite upset.
