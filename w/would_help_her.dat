5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

She travelled to the Riviera and Italy, sometimes with Maitland, at other times with her husband, hoping in vain that a different climate <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> recover. In July 1887, she settled in London in a house she and her husband rented at 15 Wynnstay Gardens, Kensington, and waited to die, although she remained mentally active.|$|E

She employed a number of literary assistants who <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> in preparing her writings for publications. She also carried on an extensive correspondence with church leaders. She traveled to Europe on her first international trip. Upon her return she promoted the message of righteousness by faith presented by young ministers E. J. Waggoner and A. T.

There she lived first in Melbourne and later moved to Cooranbong, New South Wales; co-founding Avondale College. After almost 9 years {{she returned to the}} US.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins with}} Morgana cruelly murdering the court priest of King Arthur's castle of Camelot, located just as Gawain {{was about to}} be given his knighthood. She plots to reveal Sir Lancelot Du Lac and Lady Guinevere's affair to the world, which <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> {{overthrow}} Arthur and take over. The court wizard Merlin has discovered her nefarious plans, and the unknowing Gawain is used by Merlin to force Morgana into appearing before the king. Morgana is tried for treason and sentenced to be banished from the kingdom, but she then openly declares war on him and uses her supernatural powers to kill the guards and vanish. After Morgana's later attempts to assassinate Arthur is thwarted by Merlin, the king finally decides she needs to be stopped once and for all, and orders her to be found and put to death. Merlin then handpicks Gawain to be instrument of Morgana's destruction.|$|E

500|$|After 326 performances, Leigh {{finished}} her run, {{and she was}} soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in {{the film version of}} the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that [...] "she had a small talent." [...] As work progressed, however, he became [...] "full of admiration" [...] for [...] "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> performance." [...] Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me." [...] Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's Carrie (1952).|$|E
500|$|Accompanying Duff's {{new musical}} style, the record label began {{promoting}} {{her with a}} more mature image. Duff dyed her hair dark and [...] "sexed-up" [...] her image. According to Duff, she wanted to [...] "try new things", but the image change [...] "just happened. It is not like a conscious change. People think it is so different because they have watched me grow up but that is just what happens in life." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Duff's new look as comprising [...] "dark mane, dental veneers, luxe and vampy fashions". In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> singles to garner mainstream radio play. Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for Top 40 radio, explained that [...] "radio has a stigma about playing [...] acts, considering them teen and preteen in their appeal", and that Duff's provocative image would [...] "definitely {{have a positive effect on}} the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image". A bonus EP containing five bonus remixes was released exclusively to US WalMart stores as a package with the album.|$|E
500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E

500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Toyah {{received}} a letter from Phil asking her to visit him in prison and in return he would plead guilty to raping her. Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E
500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. She felt as a location it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of whether or not you like the content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey's {{performance}} was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for [...] "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle {{was chosen as the}} sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song [...] "Emotions" [...] Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was [...] "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said [...] "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For [...] "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it <b>would</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began [...] "Vision of Love", her [...] "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, [...] "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began [...] "piling their vocals" [...] over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more [...] "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals: ...|$|E
