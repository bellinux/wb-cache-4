40|$|Abstract — Optimization of {{machining}} {{parameters for}} improving the machining efficiency is become important, when high capital cost NC machines have been employed for high precision and efficient machining. The strategy is to minimize the production time and cost by optimizing feed per tooth, speed, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> depth of cut and tool diameter by satisfying all the constraints such as maximum machine power, maximum cutting force, maximum machining speed, feed rate, tool life and required surface roughness. The optimal End milling cutter diameter and radial depth of cut (step over) are also the key issues for minimization of total production cost. Therefore, in this paper an attempt {{has been made to}} include all major parameters such as feed per tooth, speed, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> (Step-over) and depth of cut along with diameter of tool for minimising the time and production cost during 2. 5 D milling.

Optimal values of machining parameters have been calculated for benchmark problems and compared with handbook recommendations. It has been found that approximately 13 % of production cost can be reduced by choosing optimal cutter diameter and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Besides this 50 % reduction in cost per unit volume and 61 % increment in material removal rate has also been reported by selecting optimal cutting parameters over the handbook recommendations...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for reducing milling exit burrs is to prevent the tool from exiting the workpiece. Exit here refers the condition in which a cutting edge is moving out of the workpiece while removing material. Only entrance burrs can occur under this circumstance, which are usually considered burr-free. This study proposes a set of geometric algorithms for avoiding tool exits in planar milling. Two distinct approaches are developed for tool path planning of 2 -D polygons. The first approach generates exit-free tool paths by offsetting the workpiece edges with appropriate <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> The second one adjusts tool positions locally on given tool paths. In addition, a two-stage algorithm is designed for 2 -D free-form contours. The cutter locations causing the tool to exit the workpiece are first detected; then a heuristic scheme is applied to generate new cutter locations with no tool exits.

40|$|Excessive noise {{generation}} often occurs during the face-milling of thin-walled aluminum workpieces. It {{has been suggested}} that such noise can be reduced by utilizing milling cutters which employ non-uniform insert pitch. This report presents the results of a test series undertaken to determine the noise reduction potential of four different non-uniform insert pitch cutters used to machine the engine mounting face of an aluminum transmission housing. The tests were performed using the actual high volume, transfer-line machinery. It is shown that the use of non-uniform insert pitch does not necessarily reduce overall {{noise generation}}. There is, however, often a reduction in noisiness. To better understand the structural response of the workpiece a complete modal analysis is performed. In addition, noise frequency response functions are generated and are shown to form a basis on which to predict the noise radiation characteristics of the workpiece. A hybrid digital-analog computing system is developed and then used to simulate the workpiece response and to demonstrate the influence of various parameters such as forcing function definition, natural frequency, damping, and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> on system response. A more realistic forcing function definition, than the often used force impulse model, is developed. It is subsequently shown that significant differences in workpiece response occur for excitations based on these two models. It is also demonstrated that variation in <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> has a significant influence on the forcing function definition. Several techniques for improving 2 ̆ 2 quiet cutter 2 ̆ 2 design strategies are illustrated. In particular, a technique of sectoring the workface into sections with constant 2 ̆ 2 effective 2 ̆ 2 <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> is described.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of aerospace components are manufactured from titanium and nickel alloys {{that are difficult to}} machine due to their thermal and mechanical properties. This limits the metal removal rates that can be achieved from the production process. However, under these machining conditions the phenomenon of process damping can be exploited to help avoid self-excited vibrations known as regenerative chatter. This means that greater <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> can be taken so as to increase the metal removal rate, and hence offset the cutting speed restrictions that are imposed by the thermo-mechanical properties of the material. However, {{there is little or no}} consensus as to the underlying mechanisms that cause process damping.

A signal processing procedure is employed to identify flank/workpiece interference from experimental data. Meanwhile, the short regenerative model is solved using a new frequency domain approach that yields additional insight into its stabilising effect. However, analysis and signal processing of the experimentally obtained data reveals that neither of these models can fully explain the increases in stability that are observed in practice.

The predictions were in error at low cutting speeds, indicating that the force oscillations are not superposable at this condition...|$|R
5000|$|Set: The {{degree to}} which the teeth are bent out {{sideways}} away from the blade, usually in both directions. In most modern serrated saws, the teeth are set, so that the kerf (the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cut)</b> will be wider than the blade itself. This allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding (getting stuck). The set may be different depending on the kind <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> the saw is intended to make. For example, a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel, so that it rips or tears the material apart. A [...] "flush-cutting saw" [...] has no set on one side, so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it. The set of the blade's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set.|$|R
50|$|On June 16, 1972, several minor slips of mud were noticed along Po Shan Road. The {{road was}} blocked off by falling mud at a {{construction}} site and several cracks started to appear in a retaining wall. Inspections were performed on many structures but as it was raining, ultimately no major evacuation or alert measures were undertaken. On June 17, a slip had occurred over the whole <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cut</b> slope at the southern face of Inland Lot 2260 on Po Shan Road, carrying away nearly all the bamboo framing and metal sheet covering. In addition, authorities noticed severe subsidence of several buildings around IL 2260. Residents were then urged to leave their houses and apartments as a precaution.|$|R
