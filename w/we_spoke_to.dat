5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
2500|$|A {{phone call}} from Pakistan to a Karnataka {{journalist}} claimed {{there would be more}} blasts in Kerala on Sunday. Kerala police chief Raman Srivastava said: [...] "I have been informed by the DGP of Karnataka about the terror threat to Kerala. <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the journalist concerned, who said he had received two calls today – one at 1pm and another at 3:30pm." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} the street {{which led to}} Philip's hotel, <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{each other for the}} first time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, it is a mournful place; I {{never did}} {{anything}} so good-natured. And, with the widow's knowledge, I am to do as I please till the girl's eyes are opened. I think it will need that stratagem <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> of <b>to</b> open them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you did {{you would}} wrong me," [...] Margaret answered, [...] "for I never once during {{all the years}} that <b>we</b> lived {{together}} <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Walter one word about his money." ...|$|R
60|$|Felix and I couldn't {{keep our}} eyes off her. Crimson-cheeked, shining-eyed from her haste, {{her face was}} like a rose of youth. But when the Story Girl <b>spoke,</b> <b>we</b> forgot <b>to</b> look at Felicity.|$|R
60|$|Maud and I {{went about}} our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had {{overtaken}} him,—how fearful we were yet fully to realize. There was the awfulness of retribution about it. Our thoughts were deep and solemn, and <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> each other scarcely above whispers.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear; {{but as we}} all {{believed}} that {{there was such a}} will, we were naturally unwilling to let the matter rest. Still, the chance of finding it seemed very remote. You remember <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you about it when they offered you that hundred a year." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} is apart from the moral I wished to draw from the incident. The true inwardness of the {{situation}} lay in the indignation of this Britisher at finding a German railway porter unable to comprehend English. The moment <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him he expressed this indignation in no measured terms.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be no}} use {{trying to}} do that. They will guard the {{entrance}} gates, give the alarm, and set all the priests on duty in the temple in search. No, come along quickly. They cannot be {{sure that it is}} <b>we</b> who <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them, and will probably wait until one has ascended the stairs to see that no one is lurking there. I think we are safe for the moment; but there are no good hiding-places. I think you had better walk straight to the entrance, Chebron. Your presence here is natural enough, and those they post at the gates would let you pass out without suspicion. I will try and find myself a hiding-place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We must rest here as best <b>we</b> can,' <b>spoke</b> Covan <b>to</b> the cows. And they bowed {{their heads}} and lay down {{in the place where}} they stood. Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag, whose eyes never closed, and whose wings never tired; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty, and soft moss for a bed.|$|R
6000|$|Summer {{and winter}} our eyes had {{rested on the}} dim outline of the {{mountains}} in our horizon, to which distance and indistinctness lent a grandeur not their own, so that they served equally to interpret all the allusions of poets and travellers; whether with Homer, on a spring morning, we {{sat down on the}} many-peaked Olympus, or, with Virgil and his compeers, roamed the Etrurian and Thessalian hills, or with Humboldt measured the more modern Andes and Teneriffe. Thus <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> our mind <b>to</b> them, standing on the Concord cliffs.-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Springrove came fifth; Manston seventh. When the {{examination}} of all was ended, and the last man had retired, Nyttleton, again as at the former time, blandly asked his client which of the eight she personally preferred. 'I still think the fifth <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to,</b> Springrove, the man whose letter I pounced upon at first, to be {{by far the best}} qualified, in short, most suitable generally.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{crossed the}} road, and were {{pressing}} on towards her, when {{it occurred to}} me that she might be more disposed to feel a woman's interest in the lost girl, if <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her in a quieter place, aloof from the crowd, and where we should be less observed. I advised my companion, therefore, that we should not address her yet, but follow her; consulting in this, likewise, an indistinct desire I had, to know where she went.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{go to bed}} at eight:thirty this evening," [...] Mr. Crockett retorted. [...] "And {{you don't}} get any hundred. The lady <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you about will be here before six. She is to have, as we explained, daily and hourly charge of you. At six-thirty, as usual, you will dine, and she will dine with you and see you to bed. As we told you, she will have to serve the place of a mother to you--see that your ears are clean, your neck washed--" ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} storylines surrounding the couples union was the aftermath of John Paul and Craigs affair being revealed to other characters within the series, particularly Craigs girlfriend (Sarah). [...] "A lot of the aftermath stuff is really good," [...] Burnet cited. [...] "We changed {{a hell of a lot}} of it. It came out initially script stage and its in the same week as another major storyline so <b>we</b> went and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> producers and manipulated the scripts slightly with the director, Nigel Keane, and the consequence was a fantastic four episodes to end it on, I think. Something real." ...|$|R
6000|$|Césarine {{smiled at}} my evident surprise. [...] "Papa and I met Miss Latham this {{afternoon}} in Bond Street," [...] she said gaily, {{in answer to}} my mute inquiry, [...] "and <b>we</b> stopped and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> one another, of course, about last night; and papa said you couldn't come round to tea {{with us in the}} Crescent, because you were engaged already to Miss Latham. And Miss Latham very kindly asked me to drive over and take tea with her, as I was so anxious to thank you once more for your great kindness to me yesterday." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{a mischievous}} sense of humour, he would often pull pranks {{on the rest}} of the cast during recordings. Despite this, however, Trevor Bannister held him in very high regard, saying of him that he was a [...] "wicked old man but a {{wonderful}} man." [...] David Croft recalls the time Arthur would disappear from the set. 'Whenever we were rehearsing he'd vanish at about three minutes to eleven. For a while we wondered where he went, but eventually discovered that he'd nip next door to the pub for a quick Pink Gin. We'd watch from the window as this little figure hurled towards the pub - <b>we</b> never <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him about it. One day when he returned, John Inman asked where he'd been. He made some excuse, but what he'd forgotten was that it was pouring with rain and his bald head was soaking wet!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} to run all risks, Victor, but I see no chance of success in it. The very first man <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> might {{denounce}} us, and if we were seized {{there would be no}} one to look after the safety of Mademoiselle de St. Caux and her sisters. My first duty is towards them. I gave my promise to their father, and although it is not probable that I can be of any use to them, I will at any rate, if possible, be at hand should occasion arise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> no one {{until we}} got to the village, beyond asking a woman which was the turning from the main road. There didn't seem to be a soul about in the village, and we had to wait about some time before I could get hold of a boy to tell me which was the revenue officer's cottage. I left Hogan outside when I went in; but he saw no one, nor did any one speak to us on our return beyond one or two men we met passing the time of night, which Hogan answered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} long story," [...] Malcolm said in a drawling voice, [...] "and I {{would not}} say for sure but that I may forget one or two, seeing that I have spoken with so many. We came across the hills, and the first person <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> was Master Fenwick, who keeps the Collie Dog at Appleswade. I don't know whether your worship knows the village. I greeted him as usual, and asked him how the wife and {{children}} had been faring since I saw him last. He said they were doing brawly, save that the eldest boy had twisted his ankle sorely among the fells." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} {{understand}} me, nor did she. We were not as ordinary lovers. We were not as man and maid who, meeting and being drawn each to the other, fence and trifle in a pretty game of dalliance until the maid opines that the appearances are safe, and that, her resistance having been of a seemly length, she may now make the ardently desired surrender with all war's honours. Nothing of that was in our wooing, a wooing which seemed to us, now that <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> of it, <b>to</b> have been done when we had scarcely met, done in the vision that I had of her, and the vision that she had of me.|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins]December 30, 1943 Bryant Service Club: Please {{accept my}} sincere {{thanks for the}} box of candy and the Christmas letter. They were both welcome and gratefully received. For the Christmas {{holidays}} I {{had the good fortune}} to be home. While in Providence I had the opportunity of visiting Bryant for a short time on the day before it closed for the holidays. Athough [sic] I didn 2 ̆ 7 t have the opportunity to see all of my professors because they are now in the service, it seemed good to get a look at the buildings again and to visit with the professors remaining. My chum, also on furlough at the same time, and I enjoyed very much our little chat with Mr. Gulski, Mr. Appleby, and Mr. Naylor. <b>We</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> jolly Mr. Richards a short time between class sessions.

5000|$|NG Jayasimha, HSI India's MD, visited Nepal {{to ensure}} the ban is being adhered to. In an {{interview}} to the Times of India he said, [...] "I am very pleased {{that we were able}} to sit down with the Nepali politicians, to speak up for the hundreds of thousands of innocent animals who are condemned to an utterly unjustified beheading at Gadhimai. <b>We</b> also <b>spoke</b> directly <b>to</b> the Gadhimai temple and the local magistrate, so they can be in no doubt of the overwhelming call for compassion. We sincerely hope that they will act to stop this unnecessary bloodshed".|$|R
6000|$|Jim pitied {{him ever}} so much, {{and so did}} I. We tried to comfort him, {{but he said it}} warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we was a mind to {{acknowledge}} him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him, and say [...] "Your Grace," [...] or [...] "My Lord," [...] or [...] "Your Lordship"--and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain [...] "Bridgewater," [...] which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Conway helped him. [...] "I {{may tell}} you, Mr. Johnson, that the foreman hinted to Mr. Tallboys {{that he thought}} you and the upper housemaid were likely {{one of these days}} to come together, and that is principally why <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you instead of to one of the others who were there. We thought, you see, that she might {{probably}} be leaving her place one of these days, and that perhaps this twenty-five pounds might enable you and her to marry earlier than you otherwise would have done. In that case, you see, it would suit us all. You and she would, moreover, have the satisfaction of knowing that you were aiding to right a great wrong, and to restore to those who have been defrauded the property Mr. Penfold intended for them. What do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We had got to {{that best}} part of Surrey not yet colonized by wealthy men from the City, but where all things are as they were of old, when, late in the day, {{we came to a}} {{pleasant}} straggling village with one street a mile long. Here we resolved to stay, and walked the length of the street making inquiries, but were told by every person <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> that the only place we could stay at was the inn--the [...] "White Hart." [...] When we said we preferred to stay at a cottage they smiled a pitying smile. No, there was no such place. But we were determined not to go to the inn, although it had a very inviting look, and was well placed with no other house near it, looking on the wide village green with ancient trees shading the road on either side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] He stole {{up to my}} {{side with}} a noiseless, animal movement, and whispered in my ear. His eyes were burning; his face was full of evil meaning. Yet I did not shrink from him. I welcomed him with a smile. He whispered into my ear. It was like the hiss of a snake; but I smiled. I whispered back again. He nodded. Ah! the way before me was growing clear at last. Was it not fate that had brought Gomez ready to my hand? Ay! fate! A good fate! A kind fate! We stood close {{together}} in that dimly lit room; and though we {{were alone in the}} house, <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> in whispers <b>to</b> one another. When I moved to the door, Gomez followed me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> of the governor-generalship, {{at least}} I <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> [...] Granville who stayed {{a little after}} Hartington, and I said [...] Goschen’s {{position}} as to the franchise would prevent his being in [...] the cabinet now, but he should be in great employ. Granville had [...] had {{the lead in the}} conversation, and said the Queen requested [...] him to carry the message to me.|$|R
5000|$|At halftime, Crompton had {{completed}} only four passes for 62 yards. Still, thanks to {{some success in}} the Vols' 2-minute offense, he finished 20 for 43 for 259 yards and two touchdowns. [...] "There were drops. It was bad. There was no rhythm," [...] Kiffin said. [...] "We're {{not good enough to}} overcome drops. You start adding those drops in, and we're going to struggle." [...] Todd, who completed 19 of his 32 attempts, had his choice of receivers, completing passes to eight different targets. The Tennessee defense was noticeably frustrated, and defensive end Chris Walker and tackle <b>Wes</b> Brown <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the entire team in a huddle at the sideline after Tate's touchdown run. [...] "We have to make those plays because the defense was on the field {{a lot of time in}} the first half, and that goes somewhat on us," [...] Hardesty said. [...] "We've got to stay on the field on third downs. We've got to keep drives going." [...] Auburn went on to go 8-5 and finish tied for 4th in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference.|$|R
60|$|A little {{south of}} east was Palos, where Columbus weighed anchor, and farther yet the pillars which Hercules set up; {{concerning}} which when we inquired {{at the top}} of our voices what was written on them,--for we had the morning sun in our faces, and could not see distinctly,--the inhabitants shouted Ne plus ultra (no more beyond), but the wind bore to us the truth only, plus ultra (more beyond), and over the Bay westward was echoed ultra (beyond). <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them through the surf about the Far West, the true Hesperia, [Greek: eô peras] or end of the day, the This Side Sundown, where the sun was extinguished in the Pacific, and we advised them to pull up stakes and plant those pillars of theirs on the shore of California, whither all our folks were gone,--the only ne plus ultra now. Whereat they looked crestfallen on their cliffs, for we had taken the wind out of all their sails.|$|E
6000|$|The {{people of}} those foreign {{countries}} are very, very ignorant. They [...] looked curiously at the costumes we had {{brought from the}} wilds of [...] America. They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes. [...] They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we [...] conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the [...] mischief we came from. In Paris they just simply opened their eyes [...] and stared when <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them in French! We never did succeed in [...] making those idiots understand their own language. One of our [...] passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return [...] to buy a pair of gloves, [...] "Allong restay trankeel--may be ve coom [...] Moonday;" [...] and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born [...] Frenchman, had to ask {{what it was that}} had been said. Sometimes it [...] seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference between [...] Parisian French and Quaker City French.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was down}} on the floor, {{crouched}} up in a corner--a dark little woman, smartly dressed in gay colors. Her black hair and her big brown eyes made the horrid paleness of her face look even more deadly white than perhaps it really was. She stared straight at us without appearing to see us. <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her, and she never answered a word. She might have been dead--like her husband--except that she perpetually picked at her fingers, and shuddered {{every now and then}} as if she was cold. I went to her and tried to lift her up. She shrank back with a cry that well-nigh frightened me--not because it was loud, but because it was more like the cry of some animal than of a human being. However quietly she might have behaved in the landlady's previous experience of her, she was beside herself now. I might have been moved by a natural pity for her, or I might have been completely upset in my mind--I only know this, I could not persuade myself that she was guilty. I even said to Mrs. Crosscapel, [...] "I don't believe she did it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ferez's parents Françoise and Olivier, of Prouzel, appealed: [...] "Please help us {{to reveal}} the truth. Help us to know, to {{understand}} and {{to come to terms}} with our loss." [...] They also stated: [...] "Rest assured that we will not leave you in peace; and you will not be able to live in hiding forever." [...] DCI Mick Duthie stated: [...] "I also want to reiterate an appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious throughout that day, last Sunday, June 29. Just to repeat what <b>we</b> know: Laurent <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> his fiancee around 01:00 BST on the Sunday morning. After that, no-one heard from Laurent or Gabriel or saw them. It is important to stress that the attack could have taken place at any time during Sunday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{they were}} for making our country Austrian, my friend," [...] he cried. [...] "Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor. Because the {{most of them were}} immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be by {{morality}} and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued. And so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs. We swore to live {{by the standards of the}} great Jahn, of whom you <b>spoke.</b> <b>We</b> swore <b>to</b> strive for the freedom of Germany with manly courage. And when we were not duelling with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Here ʿan yad (from/for/at hand), is {{interpreted}} {{by some to}} mean that they should pay directly, without intermediary and without delay. Others say that it refers to its reception by Muslims and means [...] "generously" [...] as in [...] "with an open hand," [...] since the taking of the jizya {{is a form of}} munificence that averted a state of conflict. al-Ṭabarī gives only one explanation: that ‘it means “from their hands to the hands of the receiver” just as <b>we</b> say “I <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him mouth to mouth”, we also say, “I gave it to him hand to hand”’. M.J. Kister understands an yad to be a reference to the [...] "ability and sufficient means" [...] of the dhimmi. Similarly, Rashid Rida takes the word Yad in a metaphorical sense and relates the phrase to the financial ability of the person liable to pay jizya.|$|R
