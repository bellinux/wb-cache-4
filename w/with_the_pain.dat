5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, {{in the context}} of an acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many of these drugs have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E
5|$|Pain {{medication}} such as NSAIDs and paracetamol (acetaminophen) {{helps in}} the management of pain associated with strep throat. Viscous lidocaine may also be useful. While steroids may help <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> they are not routinely recommended. Aspirin may be used in adults but is not recommended in children due to the risk of Reye syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an epidural patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E

5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, Harris was {{diagnosed}} with a torn labrum in her right hip which occurred during a goal kick. Harris did not miss any games following the injury and instead switched to mainly using her left leg and dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Dorrance again employed the two-goalkeeper method, as Harris split time with junior goalkeeper, Anna Rodenbough. The two goalkeepers alternated starts and played for half of each game. Harris played in 19 games and made 9 starts, playing a total of 1120 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 29 saves, giving a 0.763 save percentage. UNC lost their match against Notre Dame in the third round of the 2007 NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament on November 24, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.|$|E
25|$|With {{insufflation}} {{the effects}} are more abrupt and intense but have a significantly shorter duration, while oral usage results in a milder, longer experience. When insufflated, the onset happens very rapidly, usually reaching the peak at about 20–40 minutes and plateauing for 2–3 hours. 2C-B is also {{considered one of the}} most painful drugs to insufflate, with users reporting intense nasal burning lasting as long as 30 minutes. The sudden intensity of the experience combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> can often start the experience with a negative imprint and nausea is also increased with insufflation, compounding the issue.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might wonder why a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} {{increasing}} back pain for several seasons, Braves starter Tim Hudson underwent back surgery on November 28, 2011. Hudson {{stated that he}} had been using anti-inflammatory medication {{for the past two years}} to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> After the procedure, Hudson's mobility has greatly improved and he anticipates that the surgery will prolong his career. Because the procedure requires three to six months for proper recovery, Hudson does not expect his 2012 debut to come until early May. In his absence Randall Delgado will occupy his rotation spot. Recovering with haste, Hudson started the final exhibition game in Florida on April 2 against the New York Mets. In two scoreless innings of work, Hudson allowed only one hit and struck out two while throwing every pitch in his arsenal.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that, {{in addition to}} its base functions, the insula {{may play a role in}} certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. The right anterior insula aids interoceptive awareness of body states, such as the ability to time one's own heartbeat. Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the amount of effort a person believes he/she is exerting.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s most American {{schools of}} {{architecture}} {{broke away from}} the Beaux-Arts tradition and began to establish their own curricula and teaching methods.

His goal was to encompass the surrounding terrain in line with contemporary art. Art historian Solvita Krese called the project successful and lauded the design for avoiding exaggeration of themes at hand. She also noted that the memorial fit well with the terrain. Architect Ausma Skujiņa also said the project was successful among many other less successful ones. She stressed its positive nature and how the memorial [...] "reconciles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> and evens it out."
