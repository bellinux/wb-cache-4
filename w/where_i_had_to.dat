You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. I just held her hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Tyler {{played the}} object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. In {{discussion}} of the role, {{she said it was}} [...] "definitely the first part <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} for Rowland’s segment in the iheartradio concert series, {{it was revealed that}} [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] had made Rowland cry. [...] She said “the first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wear rose colored glasses,” in particular noting her past “toxic relationships” and “situations where I needed to leave” as the causes of her Rowland’s tears. Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] She also expressed her pleasure at being able to sing about her experiences.|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire Water Burn" [...] {{played a}} major role in the slow build of {{interest}} that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. Because the band could not afford financially solvent national tours, they promoted themselves by sending their music to alternative rock-based radio stations across the country. Eventually, an intern brought the band to the attention of the music director of 107.7 The End in Seattle. The director, liking what he heard, played [...] "Fire Water Burn" [...] on his Friday night show. After airing, the station was flooded with phone calls asking about the song and the band and the director passed the song onto the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles. This snowball effect eventually overwhelmed the band with demands for their new record. After hearing of the underground success One Fierce Beer Coaster was receiving, many record labels began courting the band. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick [...] "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell Madonna that I couldn’t put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop." [...] The band eventually signed a record deal with Geffen Records.|$|E

500|$|She next starred {{alongside}} Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal in Siddharth Malhotra's moderately successful family drama We Are Family, {{an official}} {{adaptation of the}} Hollywood tearjerker Stepmom (1998). Kajol {{played the role of}} Maya, a character originally played by Susan Sarandon, and which she described as [...] "a control freak", believing it [...] "is something which every woman would identify with." [...] While reviewing the film for Hindustan Times, critic Mayank Shekhar stated, [...] "The premise is stuff dry tissues are made for. Yet, the pathos here is produced not from moments, but from performances alone: a stunning Kajol's in particular. She appears superior to Susan Sarandon, I suspect." [...] New York Timess Rachel Saltz wrote, [...] "The always appealing Kajol knows how to play melodrama without being melodramatic, and her naturalism gives the movie a genuine emotional kick." [...] Her final release of the year was Toonpur Ka Super Hero, a live-action animated film, opposite Ajay Devgn. In an interview with The Express Tribune, Kajol mentioned that it was difficult to work on the film. She added, [...] "Dubbing and shooting was equally frustrating. You had to keep so many things in mind and there were a few action sequences too <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do action in front of a green space, so I was smiling, scowling, laughing– all in the wrong places!" [...] The film was a critical and commercial failure and fetched Kajol mostly negative reviews for playing a role that provided her with [...] "no scope" [...] to perform.|$|E
2500|$|Petrović needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League {{could not}} offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrović in 1986. However, {{he decided to}} {{postpone}} his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million. The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who {{played a key role}} in Petrović's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: [...] "I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay up in order to circumvent this law".|$|E
2500|$|A local admirer {{arranged}} {{for her to}} go to Nashville when she was 14 to audition for Capitol Records. In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, [...] "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation. She said, [...] "After high school, I pretty much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'". She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism. She spent part of one of her summers as a page for Oklahoma State Representative Bobby Frame. She also waited tables at a pizzeria, worked at a zoo, and at a veterinary clinic.

2500|$|Ester Dean and Dr. Luke {{also worked}} on the album, {{respectively}} writing and producing the other US lead single [...] "Rose Colored Glasses". The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the thought of all the [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to come out of their shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production. It features a [...] "tinkling piano" [...] melody and light R beat.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Holter's {{previous}} studio album, Loud City Song (2013), {{a concept}} album loosely {{inspired by the}} 1958 film, Gigi, Have You in My Wilderness is not linked by a unified narrative. Prior to the album's release, Holter noted: [...] "It's more like Ekstasis than the last record. ...
