5|$|With 35 shotgun pellets {{still in}} his body, {{including}} three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. He missed the Tour {{for the second year}} running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{repair work}} is {{interrupted}} by a recurrence of grey smoke from the south-east side of unit 3 (the general area of the spent-fuel pool) seen at 15:55 and dying down by 17:55. Employees are evacuated from unit 3, but no changes in radiation measurements or reactor status are seen. No work <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time (such as restoring power) which might have accounted for the fire. White smoke, probably steam, is also seen coming from unit 2 at 18:22 JST, accompanied by a temporary rise in radiation levels. A new power line is laid to unit 4 and unit 5 is transferred to its own external power from a transmission line instead of sharing the unit 6 diesel generators.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{due to a}} {{perceived}} need for Circassian ports and a view that an independent Circassia would impede their plans to extend into the Middle East (plans which were never achieved), Russia soon moved to annex Circassia. Tensions culminated in the devastating Russian-Circassian War, which in its later stages was eclipsed by the Crimean War. Despite {{the fact that a}} similar war <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> {{the other side of the}} Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan fighting against Russia to preserve their states' existence), as well as the attempts of some (ranging from Circassian princes to Imam Shamil to Britain) to connect the two struggles, connections between the Circassians and their allies with their Eastern Caucasian counterparts were quashed by an Ossetian alliance with Russia.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, he {{published}} Omul periculos, a pamphlet attacking the regnant House of Hohenzollern, accusing {{the king of}} abusing his prerogatives and allowing his ministers to ignore the constitution while suggesting he abdicate. Sued for lèse-majesté, {{he was sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment and a fine of 5000 lei. After writing an article to explain he was not fleeing but going into exile, he left for Vienna in May and was returned in absentia to the Assembly the following January, as an opposition member. In February, he was arrested but soon released, having gained parliamentary immunity. A government crisis <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the same time, and Panu, both in parliament and in Lupta, bitterly attacked the new government of Theodor Rosetti and the continued influence of Junimea. Later that year, he put forth a program for his party, which touched on subjects such as the peasantry, industrial development, relations between owners and workers, social insurance and universal suffrage. He shared these objectives with the socialists, along with an anti-dynastic outlook and calls for an eight-hour workday and Sundays off. However, his Radicals began to diverge from the socialists during the 1888 crisis: while the former took an active role both in parliament and in the streets, the latter kept its distance in the belief that the situation did not concern them.|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We {{wanted to get rid of}} the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. We wanted the fun and liveliness back." ...|$|E

We were the laughingstock of the world. The world's greatest democracy that couldn't conduct an election. We didn't know who our next president was going to be. The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{alternative}} {{rock bands}} have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence. The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan {{was influenced by}} Isn't Anything upon its release and attempted to recreate its sound on the band's debut album Gish (1991), particularly the closing track [...] "Daydream" [...] which Corgan described as [...] "a complete rip-off of the My Bloody Valentine sound." [...] The Smashing Pumpkins two successive studio albums, Siamese Dream (1993) and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), were also influenced by the band. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails praised Loveless musical diversity and production, Courtney Love cited the band as an influence on Hole's third album Celebrity Skin (1998) and the album has also been said {{to have made a}} considerable influence on Radiohead, particularly influencing the band's textured guitar sound. The Edge, guitarist of U2, cited Loveless as a major influence on the guitar sound on Achtung Baby (1991) and referred to My Bloody Valentine as [...] "head and shoulders above a lot of what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E

Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly. Washington exclaimed [...] "Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us." [...] Mifflin explained that he had been told that {{it was his turn to}} evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lee told MTV News {{that she}} pushed her own limits, doing things she didn't {{have the courage to}} do in the making of Fallen. She told The Sun the main themes of The Open Door are freedom and her {{personal}} life. The lyrics delve on [...] "what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time" [...] in her life and about [...] "the experimenting and fun stuff" [...] the band tried on The Open Door. Lee described the songs on the album as [...] "very dark", and said they show how to pass the tough moments in life. When comparing the songs with the material from the group's previous album Fallen, she described them as [...] " [...] very different. The chords are still there but it's just a more mature version." [...] She also said her goal was to make a record that she loved even more than Fallen, rather than to copy the formula which made the previous record successful. Incorporating classical influences and several new elements in the music, [...] the sound of the record was inspired by the works of Portishead and Björk.|$|E

500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, [...] "we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard {{had to pick up}} his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I was my mother and [...] was me. We were playing in our backyard again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{was shot}} {{multiple}} {{times in a}} drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 7, 1996, and died six days later on September 13, 1996 of complications from the gunshot wounds. Rumors of Wallace's involvement with Shakur's murder were reported almost immediately. A two-part series Chuck Philips wrote for the Los Angeles Times in 2002, [...] "Who Killed Tupac Shakur?", based on police reports and multiple sources reported that [...] "the shooting {{was carried out by}} a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier" [...] and that Wallace paid for the gun. His family publicly denied the report, producing documents purporting to show that the rapper was in New York and New Jersey at the time. The New York Times called the documents inconclusive, stating: The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called Nasty Boy on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace wrote half the session, was In and out/sat around and laid down a ref, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, {{said in an interview that}} he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. We would have heard about it, Mr. Alfred said." [...] Moreover, Philips' article was based on multiple sources. As the Assistant Managing Editor of the LA Times Mark Duvoisin wrote: [...] "Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ... remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying." [...] Faith Evans remembered her husband calling her the night of Shakur's death and crying due to him being in shock. Evans added, [...] "I think it’s fair to say he was probably afraid, given everything that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> that time and all the hype that was put on this so-called beef that he didn’t really have in his heart against anyone." [...] Wayne Barrow, Wallace's co-manager at the time, said Wallace was recording the song [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] the night Shakur was shot. Shortly after Shakur's death, he met with Snoop Dogg, who claimed that Wallace played the song [...] "Somebody Gotta Die" [...] for him, in which Snoop Dogg was mentioned, and declared he never hated Shakur.|$|E

The GOC 60th Division, Major-General John Shea, ordered the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade and two batteries of mountain guns to Amman. After they arrived early on 28 March, Chaytor decided to attack again. The assault began at 13:00 and was again defeated by heavy gunfire. On 29 March, having repaired the railway track, a train of Turkish reinforcement arrived at Amman from the north. Chaytor decided to order a night attack and at 02:00 on 30 March, the division attacked and had some success, but eight hours later, by 10:00 it was clear the attack would not succeed.

2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred.

[...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives.
