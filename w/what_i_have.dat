5|$|We are at {{this moment}} in doubt whether during the first shock we shall not say she is gone to Ireland to her aunts, a thing that had been in contemplation... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> most of all in horror is the public papers; & I thank you for your caution as it might act on this.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers were suffering great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some businesses were short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates the necessity of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed--since you are you?" [...] quoth he. [...] "It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped in you, and yet--and yet <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> almost feared to hope." ...|$|R
60|$|Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial {{discrepancy}} did exist, just then, between <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{said and}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not {{the courage to}} say--between <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> half a mind to do.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} an account of my stock as faithfully, that is to say, of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken to carry with me, for I was resolved, {{whatever}} should happen, to keep <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left with my governess in reserve; that in case <b>I</b> should die, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> with me was enough to give him, and that which was left in my governess's hands would be her own, which she had well deserved of me indeed.|$|R
25|$|I {{confess to}} God Almighty, before the whole company of heaven, and to you, my {{brothers}} and sisters, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed; in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done and in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> failed to do, by my fault, by my fault, by my most grievous fault; wherefore I pray God Almighty to have mercy on me, forgive me all my sins, and bring me to everlasting life. Amen.|$|E
25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done already.|$|E
25|$|Everyone who meets me {{wants to}} talk about the culture of fear and I {{understand}} that, fine, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be talking about or I won’t be effective in this role, is {{what we can do to}} move forward.|$|E
5000|$|Until {{you spoke}} to Estella the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, I did not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} spoken. Even if <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> done so, <b>I</b> would not <b>have</b> {{recalled}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just said; but still, I trembled {{in spite of}} myself as I expressed in plain, blunt words <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only rapturously thought over, or delicately hinted at to Margaret, up to this time.|$|R
60|$|The {{freshness}} of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen before; <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen before, was the saddened, softened {{light of the}} once proud eyes; <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.|$|R
25|$|To sum up in a {{few words}} {{the result of this}} Instruction, you will see, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> stated, that the British Government demands from that of China {{satisfaction}} for the past and security for the future; and does not choose to trust to negotiation for obtaining either of these things; but has sent out a Naval and Military Force with orders to begin at once to take the Measures necessary for attaining the object in view.|$|E
25|$|I am {{therefore}} compelled in self-defence, {{to place}} certain facts before the public, to prove beyond {{the fear of}} contradiction, that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> asserted is the truth, {{and that it is}} Mr. Ainsworth who is labouring under a delusion, or has unfortunately lost his memory... ever since these works were published, and even when they were in progress, I have in private society, when conversing upon such matters, always explained that the original ideas and characters of these works emanated from me.|$|E
25|$|I {{have nowhere}} in any thing I may have written {{declared}} {{myself to be}} a Republican; nor should I think it worth while to be a martyr and a confessor to any form or mode of government. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> staked health and wealth, name and fame upon, and am ready to do so again and to the last gasp, is this, {{that there is a}} power in the people to change its government and its governors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Until {{you spoke}} to her the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, I did not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done!" [...] And so again, twenty, fifty times over, What had she done! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done--or, no, of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tried to do--in that {{interval}} between half-past ten and half-past eleven, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left unnoticed in my diary--and the deadly sickness of terror, which I never {{felt at the}} time, came upon me now. I sat down again, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been told, without speaking to Midwinter, and without looking at him.|$|R
60|$|I was {{relieved}} when I reached M'Leod's City office, and could tell him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done--not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought.|$|R
25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been about. I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. I try to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney {{acted as if}} we had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, being the first London lady with whom I had the pleasure of acquaintance, I saw in her <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
60|$|I sat {{and gazed}} at Miss Laniston without comprehending <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know he is," [...] I returned. [...] "Let me {{tell you}} <b>what</b> {{evidence}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen of it." [...] And <b>I</b> told him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with the other convict.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{repeated}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written, {{word for}} word. It failed to satisfy her.|$|R
25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|Philipp's {{response}} was [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I categorically refuse to {{allow myself to}} be held to such advice; I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to do!" ...|$|E
500|$|It became {{apparent}} that his comments condemning Holocaust denial had been printed in a neo-Nazi magazine, and {{that most of the}} anonymous calls and letters were [...] "From people who tried to prove that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen with my own eyes, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> experienced in Auschwitz was a big, big mistake, a big hallucination on my part because it hadn't happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thank God, that {{faithful}} love helped me, and I {{sat down}} again without saying a word. SHE knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> suffered and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> suppressed. She ran round to me, with the tears streaming from her eyes. [...] "Oh, Marian!" [...] she whispered softly. [...] "If {{my mother had been}} alive, she could have done no more for me!" ...|$|R
60|$|The reply being exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected, <b>I</b> {{was not in}} {{the least}} disappointed.|$|R
500|$|On Sept 21, 1937, Hugo Black was “besieged” by reporters. He said, “If I {{make any}} {{statement}} {{it will be}} in a way the people can hear me and understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say, and not have to depend on some parts of the press which might fail to report all I have to say.” ...|$|E
500|$|According to Henderson, {{since the}} {{intelligent}} design movement uses ambiguous references to a designer, any conceivable entity may fulfill that role, including a Flying Spaghetti Monster. Henderson explained, [...] "I don't {{have a problem}} with religion. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a problem with is religion posing as science. If there is a god and he's intelligent, then I would guess he has a sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{have decided}} to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because I have any illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because {{there are things that}} I must say to you. I have spent many days and nights behind bars {{thinking}} about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} in the plainest words <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen on his child's frock, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feared <b>had</b> {{happened}} at Browndown. He turned deadly pale. If I ever yet set my two eyes on a man thoroughly frightened, Reverend Finch was that man.|$|R
60|$|The singing went on upstairs. Major Fitz-David still waited impenetrably to hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to say--to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{resolved}} {{on doing}} next.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew from}} the added warmth of her kiss <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said had pleased her.|$|R
