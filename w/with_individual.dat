40|$|Background: The ComFor {{study has}} {{indicated}} that <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show enhanced visual local processing compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID only. Items of the ComFor with meaningless materials provided the best discrimination between the two samples. These results {{can be explained by}} the weak central coherence account. The main focus of the present study is to examine whether enhanced visual perception is also present in low-functioning deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> and without ASD compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, and to evaluate the underlying cognitive style in deaf and hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Method: Different sorting tasks (selected from the ComFor) were administered from four subsamples: (1) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID (n = 68); (2) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD (n = 72); (3) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and deafness (n = 22); and (4) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, ASD and deafness (n = 15). Differences in performance on sorting tasks with meaningful and meaningless materials between the four subgroups were analysed. Age and level of functioning were taken into account. Results: Analyses of covariance revealed that results of deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD are in line with the results of hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD. Both groups showed enhanced visual perception, especially on meaningless sorting tasks, when compared <b>with</b> hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, but not compared <b>with</b> deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID. Conclusions: In ASD either with or without deafness, enhanced visual perception for meaningless information can be understood within the framework of the central coherence theory, whereas in deafness, enhancement in visual perception might be due to a more generally enhanced visual perception as a result of auditory deprivation. status: publishe...|$|R
