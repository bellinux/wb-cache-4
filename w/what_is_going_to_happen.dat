25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E
25|$|A {{villager}} (Vichare) {{brings his}} 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) {{to a doctor}} in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes. They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child {{as a victim of}} retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and {{so there would be}} nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It is not clear <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will {{have to go to the}} local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E

500|$|Sam Wollaston, also {{writing for}} The Guardian, wrote {{positively}} of the scare {{factor in the}} episode, {{as well as the}} sadness. Neela Debnath of The Independent described it as a [...] "wonderful swansong to the duo" [...] and particularly praised the [...] "stylish" [...] cinematography and sense of danger. However, she considered the [...] "only flaw" [...] to be [...] "the rule that time cannot be changed if one knows <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> ... though it is probably best not to question the timey wimey side of things and just accept it and enjoy the adventure". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, writing that it [...] "stood strong as a heartfelt, emotional end for the TARDIS' longest serving companions (since the show's noughties' return at least), and the best episode of the season thus far". Risley also praised the three leads, though he did admit the episode [...] "left a few nitpicky questions".|$|E
500|$|Some sources {{describe}} {{the subjects of}} Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in {{the sense that they}} are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic). Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> after it. [...] Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in their second episode for this season, and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, also his second episode this season, {{during the course of}} the second production season.

[...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble, it is later established that he has a gambling addiction. The idea of Elaine asking Isaac <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> with his old apartment was added during rehearsals. The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24, 1990, and a run through was held two days later.

500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> is the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd get turned on by macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E

De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.'
