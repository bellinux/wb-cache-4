5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide everyday of my life {{for the last ten}} years until I heard that song and I realized after all I can be my own hero.' And that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, y'know?... It meant something to someone.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the show was generally negative: writing in The Times following the broadcast of [...] "Conversations with the Dead", Andrew Hislop wrote that [...] "Star Cops has neither the campiness of Star Trek nor the imagination of Dr. Who to overcome its technological limitations". Also in The Times, reviewing [...] "Intelligent Listening for Beginners", Martin Cropper found that [...] "some of the individual plot-lines show invention of a sort, but the script is uniformly feeble". Meanwhile, in The Sunday Times, Patrick Stoddart was confused by the plot of [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" [...] asking readers [...] "if you are following any of this, please <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and explain". Letter writers to the Radio Times were split {{on the merits of}} the show: some such as P. Tricker of Alpheton, Suffolk praising it for having [...] "brilliant special effects, well-written scripts and actors who were convincing" [...] while others like Martin Bower of Allendale, Northumberland slated the [...] "dated designs, poor music [...] cheap sets" [...] and P. Curwen of Balloch, Dunbartonshire described it as [...] "boring – too much talk and not enough action". Science fiction fandom at the time was more positive with Anthony McKay in Time Screen describing the series as [...] "one of the most refreshing telefantasy series for years" [...] while the British Science Fiction Association gave the show their Media Award in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{in early}} 2009, the BBC {{broadcast}} an Attenborough one-hour special, Charles Darwin and the Tree of Life. In {{reference to the}} programme, Attenborough stated that [...] "People <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that evolution is only a theory. Well, {{it is not a}} theory. Evolution is as solid a historical fact as you could conceive. Evidence from every quarter. What is a theory is whether natural selection is the mechanism and the only mechanism. That is a theory. But the historical reality that dinosaurs led to birds and mammals produced whales, that's not theory." [...] He strongly opposes creationism and its offshoot [...] "intelligent design", saying that a survey that found a quarter of science teachers in state schools believe that creationism should be taught alongside evolution in science lessons was [...] "really terrible".|$|E

2500|$|Olivia {{restricted}} {{contact between}} the two after the trip. [...] Days before Pound was to leave for an extended stay in the US, Dorothy wrote him promising to abide by her mother's stricture and exhorting him to follow her lead: [...] "In case I do not see you alone on Wednesday, I take it that during your 'exile' you have been forbidden to <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me?....</b> if you have promised—don't break your word—don't write to me!" [...] Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published—that he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy—the only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Sharkespear biographer, [...] writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
