500|$|In 1948, the National Collegiate Athletic Association {{passed a}} set of {{regulations}} called the Purity Code, later renamed the Sanity Code, which permitted student-athletes free tuition and meals, but required that part-time jobs be legitimate and their pay commensurate with the work. Schools found to be in violation could be expelled from the NCAA. In 1950, seven schools, called the [...] "Sinful Seven"Virginia, Maryland, VMI, Virginia Tech, The Citadel, Boston College, and Villanovaadmitted they were {{in violation of the}} code. Time magazine asserted violators were far more widespread than those seven that had confessed. Maryland was the only Sinful Seven school that was also a major football power with eighty scholarship players, and Byrd led them in their stand against the Sanity Code. University of Virginia president Colgate Darden called the code hypocritical, and The Citadel's leadership refused to [...] "lie to stay in the association" [...] and requested termination of its NCAA membership. At the convention to decide Virginia's fate, Byrd said, [...] "Does Ohio State <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> expulsion of Virginia, when Ohio State has facilities to take care of four or five as many athletes as Virginia?" [...] The ensuing vote fell 25 short of the needed two-thirds majority to expel the Sinful Seven.|$|E
2500|$|The 'Red Shirts' {{membership}} rose {{to about}} 200,000 activists, which shows its fame and popularity. The Khudai Khidmatgar, 'Red Shirts', and Bacha Khan himself joined {{hands with the}} Congress against the Pakistan Movement. During the 1945 general elections, the Muslim League could only managed to win 17 seats against Congress who secured 30 seats. The Muslim League was highly benefited with its activists who played crucial role in gathering support for the Pakistan Movement, specifically Jalal-u-din Baba, an ethinc Hazarewal. His strong activism with the Muslim League captured a strong mandate of Hazara District and Attock District. Many activists, such as Roedad Khan, Ghulam Ishaq, Sartaj Aziz, and Abdul Qayyum Khan, helped up lifted the cause and image of the Muslim League in the province. Finally, a referendum was held in 1946 to decide {{the fate of the}} NWFP as to whether the people of the NWFP ( [...] now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Pakistan or India. In this referendum, majority of vote was cast in favour of Pakistan, despite Bacha Khan wanting to accede with India.|$|E

In fact, only Bulgaria and Spain (in addition to the US and UK) declared outright that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the U.S./UK resolution, while a few more nations, such as Chile and Guinea, had only said they would consider supporting it.|$|R

50|$|The {{elections}} are held using open list proportional representation, with seats allocated using the Hare quota. Any remaining seats are allocated to lists that won {{at least one}} seat or parties that received at least 3.6% of the vote. In the open list system, voters first select the list they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for,</b> and then select a number of candidates equal to {{a quarter of the}} number of seats in the constituency. The first candidate on the list is not required to receive preferential votes to be elected. Voting is mandatory, and anyone who fails to vote can be fined or imprisoned.|$|E

Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was re-elected with 216 votes. 24 Republicans voted for another candidate and Babin voted [...] "present", effectively abstaining from the vote. Two days later, Babin explained his vote. He said that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Boehner, to reflect dissatisfaction with the Speaker in his district, particularly over the Cromnibus. However, he declined to vote for another candidate because [...] "he {{would have preferred to}} see Boehner denied reelection on the first ballot, forcing a closed-door GOP caucus meeting at which a replacement might emerge." ...|$|E

50|$|Shortly afterward, Jackie sees a {{group of}} people smoking {{marijuana}} on the street. Two police officers appear and promptly arrest them, to Jackie's bewilderment. The police officers explain that smoking marijuana is against the law, and that's why they are arresting the marijuana smokers. One of the officers tells her that “a small but powerful group decided to make a law against marijuana.” She comes to the conclusion that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the legalization of marijuana when she is older.|$|R
50|$|Ward {{made his}} maiden speech {{in a debate}} on capital {{punishment}} in December 1969, declaring that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> abolition {{of the death penalty}} with a clear conscience but that there was inadequate evidence that it was safe to do so. In January 1970 he initiated a debate on housebuilding, insisting that half a million houses needed to be built every year in order to solve the housing problem; he called on the Labour government to apologise for failing to meet that target.|$|R
50|$|By this time, the {{government}} was deeply unpopular {{for a range of}} reasons including Muldoon's antagonistic style, the huge range of economic controls put in place by {{the government}}, its reluctance to reflect the increasingly liberal social mood of the electorate, and the simple fact that it had been in power for nine years. National's position was made worse with the formation of the New Zealand Party, led by maverick property developer Bob Jones. The party supported free markets and a general dramatic reduction of government interference in economic and social life; National's founding principles. The New Zealand Party thus took many votes from former National voters who disliked the government but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Labour. Labour was helped by the contrast between the older and bad-tempered Muldoon and the young, witty David Lange.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goals of}} the SPP were not new - similar sentiments had been present in Cieszyn Silesia since the Revolutions of 1848 - {{but this was the}} first time that {{supporters}} of Silesian independence were organized into a distinct political party. Silesian nationalist positions were first advocated by the Union of Austrian Silesians, which was founded in 1848 by Silesian deputies of the Austrian Parliament: Franz Hein, Hans Kudlich and Johann Demel von Elswehr. Such sentiments were also voiced informally by community institutions, like the paper Nowy Czas (New Time), edited by preacher Theodor Haase. [...] "The Szlonzakian movement had expanded in the nineties of the 19th century, collecting Slavic people who didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Poles or Czechs and chose attachment to a separate Silesian nation". Silesian nationalism achieved successes mainly in the judicial districts of Skoczów, Strumień and Frydek.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, Eggers {{registered}} one of {{the stronger}} Republican gubernatorial showings. Eight years earlier, in the 1962 Republican race against then Democrat John Connally, the Houston oilman Jack Cox, a former Democrat, ran nearly as well as Eggers in 1970. Eggers ultimately finished with about the same 46 percent margin as his ticket-mate, George H. W. Bush, who lost to Democratic former U.S. Representative Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., also of Houston. Eggers trailed Bush by 34,000 votes. In 1964, Bush had also fallen short in the U.S. Senate race against Democrat Ralph Yarborough. In the 1970 campaign, Bush defended his support in Congress for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which forbade discrimination in the sale and rental of most housing in the United States. Eggers recalls Bush's admonition to opponents of open housing in that campaign: [...] "If you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> me because of open housing, then don't vote for me." ...|$|E

The faction stated Korolevska {{was expelled}} [...] "for breach of parliamentary ethics and cooperation with the Presidential Administration"; she had been reprimanded previously. Two deputies of the “Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna”-faction, who were like Korolevska members of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party, resigned from the faction in protest against Korolevska's expelling the same day.|$|R
50|$|Some English {{people and}} parties go further {{by calling for}} the {{dissolution}} of the Union entirely, such as One England, the English Independence Party and the English Radical Alliance. However, the approach favoured by the current Labour government was (on the basis that England is too large to be governed as a single sub-state entity) to propose the devolution of power to the Regions of England. Lord Falconer claimed a devolved English parliament would dwarf the rest of the United Kingdom. Referendums would decide whether people <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> regional assemblies <b>to</b> watch over the work of the non-elected RDAs.|$|R
5000|$|In European seats, {{the secret}} ballot was {{introduced}} in 1870. However, Māori continued to use a verbal system - whereby electors had to tell the polling official which candidate they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for.</b> Māori were not allowed a secret ballot until 1938 and even voted on a different day. According to NZ History online: [...] "Up until 1951 Maori voted on a different day from Europeans, often several weeks later." [...] It was not until 1951 that voting in the four Māori electorates was held {{on the same day}} as voting in the general election.|$|R

5000|$|Villano himself {{observed}} voting at {{the five}} clustered precincts of Taluksangay. He immediately noticed {{that almost all}} voters, whether they appeared to have a disability or not, were helped by {{a small group of}} people stationed inside the precinct. When Villalon asked election officers about them, he was told they were “liners” there to assist PWDs. LENTE records show that 80 to 90 percent of all who voted were assisted. Villano thinks that the people assisted might have been illiterate rather than PWDs. “I asked them in both Tagalog and in the native dialect Tausug and they understood. I asked them who they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> and they pointed at the names.” When he asked the voters how they were related to the “liners,” they replied, “Sila ang magvo-vote para sa amin (They were the ones who voted for us).” When Villano told the election officers that this was illegal, the Board of Election Inspectors replied that she cannot assist the voters herself because she is [...] "busy".|$|E

On 22 June 2012, his {{resignation}} for his ministerial post was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Živko Budimir. However, Radivojević later claimed that he never offered a resignation.

50|$|Biaggi was {{released}} in 1991 by the sentencing judge {{on the grounds of}} ill health (heart problems, arthritis, broken bones from four falls in prison). In 1992, Biaggi attempted a political comeback. He sought his old seat in Congress, challenging his successor, Engel, in the Democratic primary. Biaggi claimed that many of his former constituents asked him to run, and that Engel had a poor record on constituent service. Despite the enthusiasm of some of his supporters, Biaggi raised little money. Engel, who raised more money and cited Biaggi's criminal convictions, won easily. After the election, the Bronx News reported that some of Biaggi's former constituents <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> him but could not. In the redistricting after the 1990 census, parts of Biaggi's old district (Throggs Neck and Morris Park) had been shifted to other districts.|$|R
