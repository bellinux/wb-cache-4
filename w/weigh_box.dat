25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can gill box (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle gill box (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle <b>weigh</b> <b>box,</b> 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E

Preslaughter and abattoir procedures were observed and evaluated. Carcasses were split in half, weighed, and broke into wholesale primal cuts of chuck, rib, loin, and hindquarter. Each primal cut was <b>weighed,</b> <b>boxed,</b> and frozen. Each half carcass of primal cuts was later dissected into lean tissue, bone, and the three compartments of fat: subcutaneous, intermuscular, and peritoneal. A portion of the loin was collected from each animal in order to obtain data on pH and shear force. Sensory panel analysis was performed on loin steaks. Due to management and environmental effects, pH values were high and the meat was dark in colour. Carcasses from adult male reindeer contained significantly lower levels of fat than carcasses of adult females. Data indicated that yearling reindeer are of greatest economic value for meat production. </p...|$|R

30|$|However, {{we believe}} “be informative” is presumably {{applicable}} to all scalar particles {{rather than a}} special property of hai per se. As stated in Liu (2000), the temporal use of hai constitutes a sharp contrast between the implicatures produced with hai and without hai. For example, 老王八點還在睡覺 laowang badian hai zai shuijiao ‘Laowang is still asleep at 8 o’clock’, the sentence without hai only suggests the proposition that “Laowang is asleep at 8 o’clock”. By contrast, the sentence with hai will produce the same proposition {{as well as an}}other entailment that “Laowang is asleep at times that are earlier than 8 o’clock”. However, the informativeness is not a special property of hai per se but is an intrinsic requirement of any words that could trigger a scalar interpretation. For instance, the restrictive adverb only also has the scalar use. The sentence “he can only lift a <b>box</b> <b>weighing</b> 5 kg” could produce the proposition that “he can lift a <b>box</b> <b>weighing</b> 5 kg” as well as an entailment that “he can lift a <b>box</b> that <b>weighs</b> less than 5 kg”. In this sense, the abstract generalization that hai is always associated with more informativity is too broad to capture the uniqueness of hai.|$|R

2500|$|Einstein {{considers}} a box (called Einstein's box; see figure) containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls {{the opening of}} a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box. The shutter uncovers the hole for a time [...] which can be chosen arbitrarily. During the opening, we are to suppose that a photon, from among those inside the box, escapes through the hole. In this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created, following the explanation given above. In order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy, it is necessary {{to find a way to}} determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it. At this point, Einstein turns to his celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity: [...] From this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy. The argument is therefore very simple: if one <b>weighs</b> the <b>box</b> before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box, the box will be lighter.
