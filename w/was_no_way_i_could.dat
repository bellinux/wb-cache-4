But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can’t be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{talk about}} Beatrice," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to tell you {{everything}} about her. I know that you will understand. We were brought up together in the same country place. We were both thrown upon the world about the same time. That was one thing, I suppose, which made us kindly disposed towards one another. We corresponded always. I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London. I lived--I can't tell you how--week by week, month by month. I ate coarse food, I was a hanger-on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me, fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries. I met no one of my own station--I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk--or tastes. I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself, no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows, no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with--and I wasn't always the gloomy sort of person I have become; in my younger days I loved companionship. And the women--my landlady's daughter, with dyed hair, a loud voice, slatternly in the morning, a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night! Who else? Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men? I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna. Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together. We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes. She was a teacher at the national school. The children weren't pleasant, their parents were worse. The drudgery was horrible, and there wasn't any escape for her. Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side. She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us. I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery. We talked endlessly of a way out. For me what was there? There was no one to rob--I wasn't clever enough. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> earn money, honestly or dishonestly. And for her, buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries, where there was scarcely a person who hadn't the taint of the place upon them--what chance was there for her? There was nothing she could do, either. I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape. And we couldn't. So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we. We read poetry. We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes. It was a morbid, unhealthy existence, but I plodded along and so did she. Then her weekly letters became different. For the first time she wrote me with reserves. I took a day's vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2002 {{there were}} no {{pumpkins}} on the Venetucci farm {{for the first time}} in 66 years, as drought conditions kept the 91-year-old Nick Venetucci from planting. [...] "I can't control the weather," [...] Venetucci lamented. [...] "With the drought, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> grow pumpkins.

5000|$|Since [...] "It Doesn't Matter Anymore" [...] swept me off my feet, I {{had become}} a raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds. I kept thick {{notebooks}} packed with copies of the weekly charts, adverts for new products, pages of predictions of future hits, reviews and comments about current artistes.

30|$|One father interviewed {{identified}} {{the question of}} gender {{as a source of}} difficulty: relations with the school are mostly undertaken by mothers and the teachers are for the most part women. This fact is closely connected to the question of school hours, often incompatible with work schedules: “I work from 5.30 to 18.00, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can ever accompany my daughter to school, or pick her up” (Parent, school 3).|$|R

5000|$|Unlike other {{cheating}} methods, cheat {{codes are}} {{implemented by the}} game developers themselves, often {{as a tool to}} playtest certain aspects of the game without difficulty. One of the earliest known examples of this type of cheat is the Konami Code, created in 1986 by Konami developer Kazuhisa Hashimoto as he worked on porting the 1985 arcade game Gradius for use on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Hashimoto is quoted as saying [...] "The arcade version of Gradius is really difficult, right? I never played it that much, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> finish the game, so I inserted the so-called Konami code." ...|$|E

In his 1977 autobiography, 'Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder', Arnold tells of their first encounter: [...] "Then for the first time, I saw Sergio Oliva in person. I understood why they called him the Myth. It was as jarring, as if I'd walked into a wall. He destroyed me. He was so huge, he was so fantastic, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even think of beating him. I admitted my defeat and felt some of my pump go away. I tried. But I'd been so taken back by my first sight of Sergio Oliva that I think I settled for 2nd place before we walked out on the stage... I never like to admit defeat, but I thought Sergio was better.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence - for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent {{is the only way}} to untangle themselves from demands.|$|R
