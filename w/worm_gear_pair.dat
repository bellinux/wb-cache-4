In {{order to}} prolong the life of steel worm pair used in track tension adjuster, a test method was {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of hardness on the fretting wear behavior of steel worm gear on a SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. Through this method the fretting wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel- 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel with different hardness matching was studied under dry sliding condition at room temperature. The results show that in the steel <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> composed of 40 CrNiMoA steel and 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel, the fretting wear volume loss of 40 CrNiMoA steel decreased {{and that of the}} 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel worm material increased with the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel increasing. When the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel is about HRC 49, fretting wear volumes of the worm specimen was equal to that of the worm wheel specimen. Based on the experimental results, reasonable hardness matching for prolonging the life of steel worm pair used in track tension adjuster was proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} {{fretting}} wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel on a SRVoscillating friction and wear tester. The {{results indicate that}} with the frequency and load increasing, both the friction coefficient and fretting wear volume increase. With the amplitude increasing, the fretting wear volume increased too, but the effect of amplitude on friction coefficient was not simple positive correlation according to the experimental results.

In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed.

In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73).
