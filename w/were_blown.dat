5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage was widespread {{throughout the area}} and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the most severe in years at Jersey City, New Jersey, {{despite the fact that}} its damage was moderate. Trees <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> down and cellars filled with water there and in nearby areas, such as Hoboken.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, the Dukes <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders led {{the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.|$|E
60|$|O, what a nice, smooth {{floor to}} dance upon! The wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> on the waving reeds, The wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> {{on the heart}} of man.|$|R
50|$|It {{was bombed}} on 17 July 2009. The {{facade of the}} Ritz-Carlton <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> away by the blast and windows had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> out of the Airlangga Restaurant on the second storey.|$|R
60|$|During {{the night}} an {{unexpected}} gale {{came up and}} the schooner <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> far out of her course. The gale came from the westward, so the vessel <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> to the east.|$|R
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses <b>were</b> <b>blown,</b> and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
6000|$|The wind? True. It <b>was</b> <b>blowing</b> hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and {{the surging}} noise! To {{have been out}} in such a wind, and not to have known it <b>was</b> <b>blowing!</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of electronic deer whistles in scaring away sika deer {{that are likely to}} run onto roads, resulting in accidents. These whistles have been used in the U. S. A. and other countries. In this study, two types of deer whistles were tested: one that has a continuous tone with a fixed frequency (Whistle A) and the other that has an intermittent tone with a modulated frequency (Whistle B). To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the whistles in alerting deer, the deer's reactions to the whistles <b>were</b> observed by <b>blowing</b> the whistle from a fixed place that is visible to the deer when they appear by the roadside. For the control sample, deer's behavior when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>was</b> observed. When no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 51 % of the deer were on alert about the observers. When Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> 67 % of the deer were on alert; this figure increased to 95 % when Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown.</b> The time durations for which the deer were alert when no whistle <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> Whistle A <b>was</b> <b>blown,</b> and Whistle B <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>were</b> 20 %, 42 %, and 73 %, respectively. These results indicated that the deer whistles are effective in alerting deer, and that Whistle B is more effective than Whistle A. Vehicles can be equipped with deer whistles to alert deer about on-coming vehicles so as to prevent them from crossing roads, and consequently reduce deer-vehicle collisions. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Whim Creek Hotel was a tin-roofed structure which <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> {{down in a}} cyclone in the 1890s. The {{hotel was}} resurrected, and has <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> down twice since; in the mid-20th century and in the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War Lysaker Station {{was hit by}} five {{sabotage}} missions by the Norwegian resistance movement, {{in which}} tanks of gasoline, attached or not attached to railroad cars, <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> up. The sabotages took place on 16 December 1944 and 9, 10, 12 and 13 January 1945. On 13 January a tanker truck was attacked as well. There were three additional attacks on Lysaker in 1944 and 1945, two of them against factories and workshops. Also, the Lysaker Bridge sabotage {{took place in the}} immediate vicinity of the station.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself. With Southampton being attacked, the halls of residence were also under siege: at South Stoneham windows <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> in by bombs. The School of Navigation at the College was relocated to the communal rooms of South Stoneham House {{for the duration of}} the war, and afterwards was moved to Warsash; in 1970 the school became independent of the University (instead it is affiliated to Southampton Solent University) and is known as the Warsash Maritime Academy.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of the}} city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
6000|$|... “It was {{followed}} by another and a much louder one,” he said. “We thought the whole city had <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> to pieces. Some said the insurgents were entering Havana. Others cried out that Morro Castle <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up.|$|R
50|$|Tailors, you <b>be</b> <b>blowed.</b>|$|R
25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> by bellows or fans.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage. Though no one was injured, windows <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss. A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to Terry Schrunk Plaza. No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.|$|E
5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day, Warren's {{squadron}} closed {{from the}} north-east while Bompart made frantic {{efforts to reach}} open water. Both fleets were hindered by a gale which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of Hoches topmasts <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and forcing them to hold back in her defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French Résolue sprang a severe leak and HMS Anson lost her mizzenmast and several topmasts.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the direction the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nearly all wind {{turbines}} are of an upwind design, meaning the rotor {{is in front}} of the nacelle when the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> Some turbines <b>are</b> of a downwind design, meaning the rotor is behind the nacelle when the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "And {{the trumpet}} shall <b>be</b> <b>blown,</b> so all {{those that are}} in the heavens and all those {{that are in the}} earth shall swoon, except him whom Allah will then it shall <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> again, then they shall stand up awaiting." [...] —Qur'an (39.68).|$|R
5|$|William mustered {{his forces}} at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, {{and was ready}} to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the {{crossing}} was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local fyrd. After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> up.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself remained silent. From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5000|$|Third, Luke {{states that}} when they got behind Clauda, the sailors were afraid that they would <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> onto the Syrtis sandbanks of north Africa. However, {{for them to have}} <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> onto those banks from Clauda, Euraquilo would have had to have <b>been</b> <b>blowing</b> from a point somewhere between east 18 degrees north and east 37 degrees north. The point midway between these figures is east 27 degrees north. This figure is only 1/4 point off the mean figure of the {{previous}} calculation.|$|R
60|$|It is now midnight, and, cunningly wedged into my bunk, {{unable to}} sleep, I am writing these lines with flying dabs of pencil at my pad. And no more shall I write, I swear, until this gale <b>is</b> <b>blown</b> out, or we <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> to Kingdom Come.|$|R
60|$|This had {{scarcely}} {{been done}} {{when the house}} <b>blew</b> up--its walls <b>were</b> driven outwards, its roof <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> off, its bottles were shattered, all its baleful contents were scattered around, and, amid an appropriate hurricane of blue fire, that drinking and gambling saloon <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> to atoms.|$|R
5|$|As the Anzac Mounted Division {{approached}} Um Zughla at 02:00 on 21 December, a halt {{was called}} until 03:30 when the column continued on to El Arish. At 07:45, the advanced troops entered the town, unopposed, {{to contact the}} civil population and arrange water supplies for the mounted force. One prisoner was captured, while lines of observation were set up, which maintained a close watch over the country east {{and south of the}} town. By 16:00 the 1st and 3rd Light Horse, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Brigades were in bivouac at El Arish, the only casualties during the day being two members of the 1st Light Horse Brigade, who <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> up by a stranded mine on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in French Polynesia. Over 700homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed. The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed. Furthermore, many roadways and highways were blocked due to flooding. In addition, 77homes on the island were destroyed. All but threehomes that belonged to Mormons on the island were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{from the}} {{hurricane}} was severe and widespread. Initially forecast to remain offshore, the system curved northeast and moved ashore, {{becoming one of}} Mexico's worst natural disasters at the time. Up to 150 boats were submerged. Countless homes in Colima and Jalisco were damaged or destroyed, large portions of the states were inaccessible by flash flooding, and hundreds of residents were stranded. All coconut plantations <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> down during the storm, leaving thousands without work and instating fear {{that it would take}} the economy years to recover. Torrential rainfall across mountain terrain contributed to numerous mudslides that caused hundreds of fatalities. In the aftermath of the cyclone, convoys delivering aid were hindered by the destruction. Residents were vaccinated {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Overall, the hurricane inflicted at least $280 million (1959 USD) in damage.|$|E
