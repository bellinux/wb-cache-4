5|$|Tornadoes {{may seem}} rare in {{downtown}} areas because downtown areas cover {{such a small}} geographical area. Considering {{the size of a}} central business district is very small compared to the city limits, tornadoes <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> outside of the downtown area more often.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} {{the company does}} not file an annual return or annual accounts, and the company's file remains inactive, in due course, the Registrar at Companies House <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the company off the register.|$|E
50|$|Will drives {{with his}} new girlfriend Kira to the Hollywood Hills home of his ex-wife Eden, who is hosting a dinner party with her new husband David. Will and Eden {{divorced}} while {{trying to cope with}} their young son Ty's accidental death. Eden met David at a grief support group, and their party {{will be the first time}} any of their friends have seen the couple in over two years. On the way, <b>Will</b> <b>strikes</b> and mercy-kills a coyote.|$|R

25|$|Usually seen in {{the summer}} sunning {{themselves}} or crossing the road later in the day. The tiny rattle makes a buzzing sound {{that can only be}} heard from a few feet. Some individuals are very aggressive and <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> furiously, while others seem lethargic and do not even attempt to rattle. They do not dig their own burrows, but rather use those dug by small rodents or gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus).|$|E
25|$|A {{straight}}-running torpedo has a gyroscope-based {{control system}} that {{ensures that the}} torpedo will run a straight course. The torpedo can run on a course {{different from that of}} the submarine by adjusting a parameter called the gyro angle, which sets the course of the torpedo relative to the course of the submarine (see Figure 2). The primary role of the TDC is to determine the gyro angle setting required to ensure that the torpedo <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the target.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the events}} are placed along {{the axis of}} train movement, their time {{coordinates}} become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's inertial frame. Events which occurred at space coordinates {{in the direction of}} train movement (in the stationary frame), happen earlier than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of train movement. In the moving train's inertial frame, this means that lightning <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the front of the train car before two observers align (face each other).|$|E

25|$|In the {{rejected}} Treaty {{establishing a}} Constitution for Europe the charter was integrated {{as a part}} of the treaty itself. In the Lisbon Treaty, however, the charter is incorporated by reference and given legal status without forming part of the treaties. The EU must act and legislate consistently with the Charter and the EU's courts <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> down EU legislation which contravenes it. The Charter only applies to EU member states as regards their implementation of EU law and does not extend the competences of the EU beyond its competences as defined in the treaties.|$|E
25|$|The path of {{the righteous}} man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who {{in the name of}} charity and {{goodwill}} shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.|$|E
25|$|Like a canter, {{the horse}} <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> off with its non-leading hind foot; {{but the second}} stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the {{striking}} off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.|$|E

25|$|For the {{observer}} {{standing on the}} platform, on the other hand, {{the rear of the}} traincar is moving (catching up) toward {{the point at which the}} flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the ends of the traincar at different times.|$|E
25|$|The various {{techniques}} of fast bowling {{lend themselves to}} three ways of getting the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught LBW either by speed, the yorker or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman {{in which case the}} ball <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the outside edge of the bat and may be caught in the slips. A badly-played bouncer will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.|$|E
25|$|The {{primarily}} nocturnal anaconda species tend {{to spend}} most of its life in or around water. Anacondas are also sometimes known as the water boa; they spend more time in water than any of the boas. They seem rather slow and sluggish when traveling on land due to their size, although they have the potential to reach high speeds in the water. They tend to float {{beneath the surface of the}} water with their snouts above the surface. When prey passes by or stops to drink, the anaconda <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> (without eating or swallowing it) and coil around it with its body. The snake will then constrict until it has suffocated the prey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{have to buy}} or borrow it, my man. Supposing I {{give you}} two dollars {{for the use of}} the horses and another dollar for the lantern, how <b>will</b> that <b>strike</b> you?" ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike most vipers, {{members of}} this genus <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> and then hold on and chew. In one case, a machete was used to pry off the jaws. March (1929) wrote that A. mexicanus (A. nummifer) will hang on and make half a dozen {{punctures}} unless quickly and forcibly removed. However, {{the effects of the}} venom include only transient pain and mild swelling. In one part of Honduras the locals even insist that the snake (A. nummifer) is not venomous. Laboratory studies suggest that Atropoides venoms are unlikely to lead to consumption coagulopathy and incoagulable blood in humans. However, other research revealed that of ten different Costa Rican pit viper venoms tested on mice, that of A. picadoi was the most hemorrhagic.|$|E
25|$|A {{stallion}} {{will defend}} his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues {{a warning to}} the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still {{on the ground as}} if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{has broken}} up with Hunter and has found out that Ciaran is her true birth father, making Killian her half-brother. The council of witches sends Eoife, an elderly witch, to Morgan to ask her for her {{assistance}} for the rescue of the Starlocket coven, which the International Council of Witches thinks the mysterious dark wave <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> next. Morgan has {{to get close to}} Killian to get closer to Ciaran so she called Killian to Widow's Vale and asked him to contact Ciaran. She feels apprehensive and hesitant about facing Ciaran, but at the same time, has a strange urge to hug him since she has finally found her true father. She refuses to hug the same man that killed her mother Maeve Riordan and Angus, her lover, however. Near the end of the book, she shape shifts into a wolf, with Ciaran, and learns his true name, which can control him. Morgan is faced with a choice between the people she loves and the powerful and seemingly dark magick her father can teach her.|$|E

500|$|When {{the middle}} {{horizontal}} wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 1 li and the wooden {{figure in the}} lower story <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the drum. When the upper horizontal wheel has made 1 revolution, the carriage will have gone 10 li and {{the figure in the}} upper storey <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> the bell. The number of wheels used, great and small, is [...] in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the [...] "dog-teeth" [...] mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point.|$|E
500|$|Skírnir {{turns to}} threats; {{he points out}} to Gerðr that he holds a sword {{in his hand and}} he threatens to cut her head from her neck unless she agrees. Gerðr refuses; she says that she will not endure the {{coercion}} of any man, and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected. Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr's jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by [...] "the sons of men". From early morning, Gerðr will sit on an eagle's mound, looking outward to the world, facing Hel, and that [...] "food shall be more hateful to you than to every man is the shining serpent among men".|$|E
500|$|August 2008 saw {{the release}} of Devil's Due's Halloween: 30 Years of Terror to {{celebrate}} the thirtieth anniversary of the Halloween franchise. This comic book one-shot {{is a collection of}} short stories inspired by John Carpenter's original. [...] "Trick or Treat" [...] features the MacKenzies, unseen characters from the first film who Tommy and Lindsey run to for help. [...] "P.O.V." [...] shows a murder from the point of view of both Michael and his victim, [...] "Visiting Hours" [...] sees Laurie Strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978, while [...] "Tommy and the Boogeyman" [...] reveals that Tommy Doyle grew up to write comic books featuring Michael Myers. In the final story, [...] "Repetition Compulsion", Dr. Loomis tries to predict where Michael <b>will</b> <b>strike</b> next on Halloween, 1989. Writer Hutchinson explains that H30 came about because, unlike previous decades, there was no Halloween film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge the occasion.|$|E
