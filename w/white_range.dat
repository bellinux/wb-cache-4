Stars and snips may lopsided, off-center, or otherwise strangely placed. Blazes are usually blocky or straight-edged, and bottom-heavy. Splashed white blazes may also be crooked or skewed to one side.

60|$|Outside, shabby frame houses {{ran down}} {{hill to the}} angry green river where {{drifting}} ice-floes shocked. Dark woods rolled up the other bank and trails of mist crawled among the pines. Patches of snow checkered the rocks above; in the distance a <b>white</b> <b>range</b> glimmered against leaden cloud. The settlement looked strangely desolate in the driving rain, but the small ugly houses were the last Jim's party would see for long. The wagon road ended there and a very rough pack trail led into the wilds. There was another hotel, to which the men Jim had engaged had gone.|$|E

Though it was some distance off, probably a day's journey, allowing for the difficulty of the march, Vane gazed at it earnestly. The trees were bare--there was no doubt of that, for the dwindling ranks, diminished by the distance, stood out against the snow-streaked rock like rows of rather thick needles set upright. Their straightness and the way they glistened suggested the resemblance.|$|E

It was a picture that a man unused to the wilderness might have shrunk from, but Gordon understood his comrade. They were engaged in a great struggle, with the powers of savage Nature arrayed against them; but it was with a curious quickening of all the strength that was in them, mental and physical, that they braced themselves for the conflict.|$|E

The <b>white</b> <b>range</b> is the normal range of operating speeds for the aircraft with the flaps extended as for landing or takeoff. The green range is the normal range of operating speeds for the aircraft without flaps extended. The yellow range is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air, and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement.|$|E

30|$|The “cup” {{image of}} Fig. 11 is also of low {{contrast}} {{but most of}} the pixels of this image are too bright (in scale of 255, D= 81.70, μ= 204.86). The most frequent intensity of the cup image is 255 which is also the maximum intensity of this image whereas the minimum intensity is 111. In case of HE and EHS, some of the pixels become too dark which is not desirable. CVC, LDR, and HMF fail to extract detail information in a few cases. AGCWD transforms most of the intensities into a <b>white</b> <b>range</b> ([128, 255]) and makes the image brighter than expected. On the other hand, AGC appropriately transforms (using Eqs (3), (4), (5), and (7)) a large number of the brighter pixels into darker ones, enhancing the contrast. The proposed AGC performs superior than others because one pixel does not influence other neighboring pixels’ transformation directly. Rather, information such as image mean and standard deviation from the whole image influence the transformation of AGC.|$|E
40|$|Stick-nest rat middens are {{preserved}} piles of macrofossils that record changes in {{plants and animals}} during the late Holocene at <b>White</b> <b>Range.</b> The builders, Lesser Stick-nest Rats (Leporillus apicalis), after at least 2500 years in the area, became extinct during the Modern radiocarbon period. The rats' collection {{of plant and animal}} material provides an ecological survey of the site during this period. The species composition of the vegetation has apparently responded to increased Aboriginal populations, ire incidence or rainfall in the last 2500 years. A dramatic increase in tree and shrub material between 2510 &PLUSMN; 40 BP and 835 &PLUSMN; 62 BP at the expense of herbs is possibly related to increasing moisture availability. The middens record a collapse of trees and shrubs by 606 &PLUSMN; 136 BP then a strong recovery. Grasses have generally decreased in importance throughout the record. Bones of the Central Rock Rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus), which is currently restricted to the western MacDonnell Ranges, were found in middens dated at 433 &PLUSMN; 60 BP. Information about long-term changes in Australia's and areas is accessible using the middens of stick-nest rats and provides a useful long-term perspective for environmental management...|$|E
