25|$|Plumbers use {{equipment}} that forces pressurised liquid CO2 into a jacket around a pipe.

25|$|Woodworkers {{seem to be}} {{evenly divided}} {{on the subject of}} bench positioning. Some {{like to be able to}} access their benches from all sides, while others like their bench against a wall. The {{advantage}} of wall placement - besides the saved space - is that tools can be stored on the wall over the bench, within easy reach. This keeps the tool storage out of the way, and the tools can still be reached <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> around or bending down.|$|E
25|$|Neither Lupo nor Placido {{had seen}} their attacker, but two {{witnesses}} reported a tall, dark-haired {{man in a}} leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave {{in a car and}} even supplied a partial license plate number. Another report described a blond man with a mustache who drove from the scene in a Chevy Nova <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> on its headlights. Police speculated that the dark-haired man was the shooter, and that the blond man had observed the crime.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{cottonseed}} oil was marketed by Procter & Gamble as a creamed shortening in 1911. Ginning mills {{were happy to}} have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and can it under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter & Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to stir into a recipe, and could be stored {{at room temperature for}} two years <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> rancid.|$|E

25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E
25|$|The ferries are {{catamarans}} constructed out of aluminium, {{which was}} quite rare when the initial two crafts were {{constructed in the}} 1970s. The ferries are double-ended {{so that they can}} travel in either direction <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> around. There are four diesel engines in each vessel, one for each propeller. The propulsion system uses a marine version of the same diesel engine used to power many of the diesel buses on the transit system. The ferries can operate with only three engines if required. The ferries are equipped with radar, allowing them to operate in dense fog.|$|E
25|$|After a short career {{supporting}} German {{troop movements}} in central Africa, she was unexpectedly challenged by two motor boats, named HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou, {{which had been}} transported from Britain to the lake by an expedition led by Lieutenant-Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson. The faster and more nimble motor boats were able to chase down Kingani, which was unable to bring her larger weapon {{to bear on the}} small vessels <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> to face them. After being hit several times and crippled, and with her commanding officer and several men dead, she surrendered and was brought back to the British base. Brought into British service as Fifi, she became the first German warship to be captured and transferred to the Royal Navy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{large bore}} double pancake coil(DPC) was {{designed}} and tested with 2 G HTS wire to develop the conduction cooled superconducting magnet with central field intensity of 3 T at 20 K operating temperature and clear bore of 100 mm at room temperature. The effect of insulation between turns of double pancake coils was tested. Two double pancake coils with and <b>without</b> <b>turn</b> to turn insulation were wound using 4 mm wide 2 G conductor. A temporary result suggests that the coil wound without electrical insulation can be protected from higher over current and shows improved stability...|$|R

25|$|New levies {{were imposed}} to finance these {{large-scale}} projects. Lack of manpower, however, caused the Company {{to rely on}} local chieftains as agents for revenue collection. Among those who cooperated with the Company, some abused their authority and overtaxed the natives, exacerbating dissatisfaction among local people already burdened by other new laws imposed by the Company. Mat Salleh viewed the Company’s new rules as an infringement of native rights, refused to acknowledge the Company's authority, and continued to collect taxes from traders traveling via the Sugut River as he had before the rules were imposed, <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> {{them over to the}} Company. Numerous other local chiefs shared Mat Salleh's strong opinions against the Company's new rules. Many of them later joined his cause.|$|E

500|$|In 1918, several PHC {{members who}} wanted stricter {{standards}} concerning dress, amusements, tobacco, and {{association between the}} sexes withdrew to form the Pentecostal Fire-Baptized Holiness Church. In 1920, another schism came into the Pentecostal Holiness Church over divine healing {{and the use of}} medicine. Some pastors believed that while divine healing was provided in the atonement, Christians still had the right to turn to medicine and doctors. [...] The majority of the church—as did many Pentecostals of the time—believed in trusting God for healing <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> to earthly means. The minority withdrew and formed the Congregational Holiness Church in 1921.|$|E
500|$|McHale – {{known from}} the E! comedy The Soup – was also, like Chase, {{impressed}} by Harmon's writing. He commented that [...] "after reading Dan's script it was so {{head and shoulders above}} everything else that I was reading." [...] McHale appealed to Harmon because of his likable quality, which allowed the character to possess certain unsympathetic traits <b>without</b> <b>turning</b> the viewer against him. For the role of Annie, Harmon wanted someone who would resemble Tracy Flick, Reese Witherspoon's character from the 1999 movie Election. Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, for greater diversity, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting Alison Brie, known from her role as Trudy Campbell on Mad Men.|$|E
