Most of the buildings in the district are residences built between about 1850 and 1900, although there are examples of older and newer buildings. The oldest buildings in the district are probably Mann House at 16 Rockwood Road (c. 1806), and the Darius <b>Ware</b> <b>House</b> at 29 Rockwood Road, which dates to about 1814. The only originally non-residential building in the district is the Norfolk Grange Hall, which was built as a Baptist church in 1863, and was the first church to be built away from the historic Town Hill area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} review article various control methods for stored grain insects are {{discussed}} in detail and an emphasis was made to use non-chemical methods. Stored grain infestation {{is a very serious}} problem as various life stages of insects cause economic damage and deteriorates the quality of food grains and food products. There are number of stored grain insect pests that infest food grains in farmer stores and public <b>ware</b> <b>houses</b> and massively surge due to un-controlled environmental conditions and poor <b>ware</b> <b>housing</b> technology used. However, for suppression of multiplying insect population highly specific and more appropriate modern methods are to be used. Few important methods such as microwave and ionizing irradiation, pheromone baited traps, IGRs and use of entomopathogens are proved highly effective against stored grain insects. Over these methods, repellents and oviposition inhibitors isolated from various plant speices are considered as much safer in comparision to synthetic pesticides. These natural pesticides have no side effect and are biodegradable in natural environment. However, non-residual non-persistent and less toxic bio-organic pesticides should be used that may not affect the quality of food grains. Besides this, low pressure and low temperature treatments are proved much safer pest management tools that represent a potential alternative of fumigants to control coleopteran and lepidopteran insects. However, for an effective control of stored grain insects various parasitoids, predators, pathogens and other living organisms are employed in natural conditions to suppres...|$|R
