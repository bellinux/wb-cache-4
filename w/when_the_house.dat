5|$|Sir Edward Phelips' {{descendants}} {{occupied the}} house {{until the early}} 20th century. Following a brief period, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was let to tenants (one of whom was Lord Curzon who lived at the house with his mistress, the novelist Elinor Glyn), it was acquired by the NT in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building is also similar to how it appeared <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was constructed. However, a few changes have been made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses.|$|E
5|$|Across the way, Mr. Speaker, sit the {{purveyors of}} gloom who would {{endeavour}} for political purposes, to panic the Canadian people... They had a warning... Did {{they tell us}} that? No. Mr. Speaker, why did they not reveal this? Why did they not act <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information... You concealed the facts, {{that is what you}} did.|$|E
40|$|A {{deformable}} {{bearing seat}} is described for seating {{a bearing assembly}} in a <b>housing.</b> <b>The</b> seat includes a seating surface in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> having a first predetermined spheroidal contour <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> is in an undeformed mode. The seating surface is deformable to a second predetermined spherically contoured surface <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> is in a deformed mode. The seat is particularly adaptable for application to a rotating blade and mounting ring assembly in a gas turbine engine...|$|R

5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E
5|$|In his {{campaign}} for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E
5|$|Kingship had its ritual aspects. The {{kings of}} Dál Riata were inaugurated by putting their {{foot in a}} {{footprint}} carved in stone, signifying that they would {{follow in the footsteps}} of their predecessors. The kingship of the unified kingdom of Alba had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practices. Iona, the early centre of Scottish Christianity, became the burial site of the early kings of Scotland until the eleventh century, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Canmore adopted Dunfermline near Scone.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} by archaeologists in 1980. A number of finds {{are now in}} the Kirkcaldy Museum. A steading and cottages were once associated with <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> although these were demolished <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> estate was built.|$|R

40|$|One or more linear and/or {{curvilinear}} mounting rails are {{coupled to}} a structure. Each mounting rail defines a channel {{and at least}} one cartridge assembly is engaged in the channel. Each cartridge assembly includes a housing that slides within <b>the</b> channel. <b>The</b> <b>housing</b> defines a curvilinearly-shaped recess longitudinally aligned with <b>the</b> channel <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> is in engagement therewith. The cartridge assembly also includes a cleat fitted in the recess for sliding engagement therealong. The cleat can be coupled to a fastener that passes through the mounting rail and <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> is so-engaged in the channel. The cleat is positioned in the recess by a position of the fastener...|$|R
5|$|The last operatic {{music to}} be heard in the old house had been the finale of Falstaff, {{conducted}} by Solti with the singers led by Bryn Terfel, in a joint opera and ballet farewell gala in July 1997. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> reopened in December 1999, magnificently restored, Falstaff was the opera given on the opening night, conducted by Haitink, once more with Terfel in the title role.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliamentary}} clerk {{continued to}} live alongside the tower, except during the interregnum of 1649 and 1660, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Lords was temporarily abolished. The sewer feeding into the moat was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E
5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and {{dovecote}} {{were retained}} at the public's request <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 {{to celebrate the}} Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E

50|$|The Department {{has been}} {{restructured}} numerous times during its existence, {{and the present}} Department of Buildings dates from 1972, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Housing</b> and Development Administration was split into the Department of Buildings and <b>the</b> Department of <b>Housing</b> Preservation and Development.|$|R
5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter {{subsided}} into a genteel poverty, {{using the}} Guardian {{as an ongoing}} voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in Congress, with limited success. Even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to {{the total population of}} the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> {{convened in}} December 1849, a member from Mercer County {{nominated}} Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs. After receiving 39 votes—8 {{short of a}} majority—on the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic floor leader during the session. Davis wrote that his most important work during the session was bank reform.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and sketches and interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> {{were first}} built, {{customers}} met with homebuilders and determined which style <b>the</b> <b>house</b> would use. This {{led to a}} variety in <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> architecture. Many of the homes are of the mid-century ranch style. Katherine Feser of the Houston Chronicle said that all of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> had [...] "quality workmanship and materials." ...|$|R
50|$|Largely rural {{for most}} of its history, and home to {{agricultural}} businesses including the Winchester Cheese Company, Winchester experienced rapid growth during <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> construction boom in the early to mid-2000s. However, construction and growth slowed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> bubble burst in 2007, resulting in a housing market correction.|$|R
5000|$|St. Nicholas Houses, {{often called}} [...] "St. Nick," [...] {{were built in}} 1954 under <b>the</b> Taft-Ellender-Wagner <b>Housing</b> Act of 1949. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> {{initially}} began seeking applicants, World War II veterans received priority. The buildings are managed by the New York City Housing Authority.|$|R
5|$|After the curacy {{was placed}} under the {{patronage}} of Christ Church, the incumbents were mostly scholars or members of the college; from 1616 to 1640 the curacy was held by Robert Burton, author of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who enlarged the church. In the English Civil War the medieval stained glass in the church was destroyed, {{partly due to the}} vandalism of Parliamentarian troops captured at Cirencester in 1642 and imprisoned in the church. Following the Restoration the holders of the curacy changed rapidly, often remaining in the position for only a few years at a time. From at least 1713 Christ Church leased a house in High Street to parish trustees and the profits were used for repairing the church. This continued until 1923, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was sold.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. These features were already popular in England <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of these features had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E
5|$|Burges {{bought the}} lease on {{the plot of}} land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with {{interior}} decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.R.B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it. Following a period <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> stood empty and suffered vandalism, it was purchased and restored, first by Lady Jane Turnbull, later by the actor Richard Harris {{and then by the}} musician Jimmy Page.|$|E
5000|$|In 1882, the Gevangenpoort {{became a}} prison museum. The [...] "gate" [...] {{function}} {{was lost in}} 1923 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> adjoining <b>the</b> Hofvijver were taken down to build the street that now allows busy traffic to run by it.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being {{next in line}} to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E
5|$|Desha entered {{politics}} in 1797, {{when he was}} elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Kentucky House of Representatives. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> debated the Kentucky Resolutions in 1798, he chaired the Committee of the Whole. He again served in the House from 1799 to 1802, and was elected to the Kentucky Senate from 1802 to 1807. Concurrent with his legislative career, he continued to serve in the state militia. On January 23, 1798, he was appointed as a major in the 29th Regiment. He was promoted to colonel on March 23, 1799, and on September 5, 1805, he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Brigade of the Kentucky Militia. On December 24, 1806, he was made a major general, remaining with the 7th Brigade.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, however, 84 Lumber’s profits {{plummeted}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market {{crashed and}} brought the building supplies market down with it. Vast spending and impulsive decisions contributed to a tough financial situation as well, placing 84 Lumber {{on the brink of}} bankruptcy in 2009.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> {{were ready}} for occupancy, the company allotted them to {{employees}} recommended by their foremen. It only charged minimal rent, to cover operating expenses and amortization. The company provided snow removal services, lawn mowing, and rubbish removal. The company divested itself of the properties in 1948-49, with most of <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> purchased by their occupants.|$|R
25|$|During the Kargil Conflict in 1999, however, {{land was}} given to those that participated in the war and to those that gained gallantry awards.
