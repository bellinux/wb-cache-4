5|$|The {{arrival of}} Mercator on the cartographic scene {{would have been}} noted by the cognoscenti who {{purchased}} Gemma's globe—the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> important source of income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine's father, Nicholas Perrenot, the Chancellor of CharlesV.|$|E

5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates argue that the construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also argue that the dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E

5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> answer.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E
5|$|The CCE's {{two bills}} were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce won {{the presidential}} election, and in 1853 made Davis his Secretary of War. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys {{in order to}} {{determine}} various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed, and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, and maintained that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale, and added four regiments which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in January 1999, he {{immediately}} replaced two top officials, and {{one-third of the}} remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials. In his first year, he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, {{in an effort to}} reduce court backlogs and lower recidivism rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year. Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001. In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.|$|E

5|$|When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised {{questions}} about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is {{too far from the}} planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).|$|E
