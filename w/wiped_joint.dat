50|$|Lead burning is {{not used}} as part of {{plumbing}} work for installed pipework. Lead piping has long been considered obsolete, owing to the health aspects. Even where lead piping, or lead-sheathed cable, {{still needs to be}} jointed, this is carried out with a <b>wiped</b> <b>joint,</b> rather than a burned joint. Wiping a lead joint is a soldering process, using plumber's solder (80% lead / 20% tin) and is carried out at low temperature, with a natural-draught propane blowtorch. Today, even wiped joints are rare and where an existing lead pipe must be connected to, a proprietary mechanical joint {{is more likely to be}} used.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wiped</b> <b>joints</b> {{continue}} {{to be made for}} {{as long as there are}} lead pipes in service. Although lead pipework is now rare, for health reasons, <b>wiping</b> a <b>joint</b> remains the usual way of joining it. Commonly though a joint is to be made by shortening the old lead and installing new copper or plastic piping beyond the joint. These joints are usually made today with a proprietary mechanical joint, sealing onto the soft lead by some mechanical compression ring.|$|R
50|$|Before this, leadworking used either manual bossing or <b>wiped</b> {{soldered}} <b>joints</b> to seal it.|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a <b>wiped</b> <b>joint</b> is that the soldering process involves mechanically working or 'wiping' the joint. As well as heating solder and applying it to the joint, the solder is shaped into place manually, wiping it with a non-metallic tool to form a smooth-surfaced outer shape. This relies {{on the use of}} a lead-tin solder with a wide eutectic range. This is an alloy composition that when heated and melted has a large range where it is neither fully solid nor fully liquid, but is an equilibrium mixture of both solid and liquid simultaneously. The resultant 'pasty' texture and mechanical fluidity allows the joint to be wiped to shape.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wiped</b> <b>joints</b> {{were used}} for centuries to install water {{plumbing}} and similar joints {{can be seen in}} Roman plumbing. As the wiping technique allowed a great deal of on-site flexibility for the style and dimensions of the work produced, this meant that plumbers needed few parts other than pipe, lead sheet and solder. Large and complex joints could all be made by the artisan's skill alone. With the development of copper plumbing, many different types and sizes of factory-made plumbing fitting were needed, which would be assembled on site rather than fabricated from raw materials.|$|R

50|$|Lead-sheathed cables {{were also}} used for {{telephone}} cables, as the lead outer sheath lasted well buried in wet ground. Jointing such cables could also require <b>wiped</b> lead <b>joints.</b> A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall joint wrapped in lead sheet and soldered. Such jointing continued until the 1960s {{and the availability of}} polyethylene sheathed cables.|$|R
25|$|The mushy {{state is}} desired where {{a degree of}} {{plasticity}} is beneficial for creating the joint, allowing filling larger gaps or being <b>wiped</b> over the <b>joint</b> (e.g. when soldering pipes). In hand soldering of electronics it may be detrimental as the joint may appear solidified {{while it is not}} yet. Premature handling of such joint then disrupts its internal structure and leads to compromised mechanical integrity.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be <b>wiped</b> over the <b>joint</b> to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (food-grade applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see Lead-free solder.) ...|$|R
