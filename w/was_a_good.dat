5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision maker, had {{a talent for}} selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life.

[...] As thus put, the question admits of but one reply. But as thus put, it assumes the point at issue. We contend that, as appetite <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to all the lower creation--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the infant--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the invalid--as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide to the differently-placed races of men--and as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for every adult who leads a healthful life; it may safely be inferred that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guide for childhood.

To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, {{and for the next}} year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E

5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
5|$|Gracy Singh as Gauri. Several actresses {{had offered}} {{to act in the}} film, but Aamir needed someone who matched the {{description}} of the character given in the script. After considering Rani Mukerji who did not have dates, Sonali Bendre, Nandita Das and Ameesha Patel for the role, Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala. Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{was born}} in Watertown, Jefferson County, New York, on November 22, 1814 to Robert Collins Hastings and Patience Brayton. Robert Collins Hastings <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend and {{supporter}} of DeWitt Clinton, whom Serranus gets his middle name from. When Robert died in 1824, {{the family moved to}} St. Lawrence County, New York. He completed a six-year course at Gouverneur Academy, and in 1834, he became taught and became the principal at Norwich Academy, located in Chenango County, New York. He introduced the Hamiltonian system of instruction and the Angletean system of mathematics to the academy. In 1835, he resigned from his position at the academy to study law.|$|E

5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production.

As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E
5|$|In about 50CE, a Roman vexillatio built a large timber {{fortress}} on {{a hilltop}} (near {{the site of}} the current church) at Letocetum. This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of governor Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defensive position, but the poor farmland surrounding the fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers. During the Neronian period this initial fortress was replaced with a smaller one and Letocetum then developed into a large-scale posting station. Most of the troops moved to the fortress at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58CE.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines.
