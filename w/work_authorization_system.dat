Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), {{responsible}} for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity in Nigeria is being {{faced with an}} apparent huge maintenance problem which seemingly contributes greatly to the power demand problem of the country. This apparent maintenance problem is investigated by surveying its root causes through interviews, questionnaires and data gathered from selected case studies. Questionnaires were used scientifically with a confidence level of 95 % and interval of +- 5 % and +- 4. 4 % to establish {{a high level of}} integrity on data gathered. Findings and deliverables are compared to South Africa’s power utility company Eskom for validation of the final deliverable. With the findings of this survey, the research problem was overcome by developing a new maintenance strategy and <b>work</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> for the company while making some recommendations on the training being given to its maintenance personnel. The New strategy called ‘Utility Availability Centered Maintenance Strategy’ or UACMS is presented {{in the form of a}} flow chart/ block diagram with its different sections fully explained. It mainly combines preventative, predictive and corrective maintenance strategies alongside other modern maintenance techniques. It’s all linked to a computer database support to ensure high effectiveness. Furthermore, the <b>work</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> called ‘Internal Task Authorization form’ serves to ensure responsibility in task execution within the company. During the course of this research, an excessive application of corrective maintenance strategy, lack of root cause analysis and unavailability of computer based applications were discovered in PHCN.

40|$|Abstract. While {{much of the}} Grid {{security}} {{community has}} focused on developing new <b>authorization</b> <b>systems,</b> the real challenge is often integrating legacy <b>authorization</b> <b>systems</b> with Grid software. The existing <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> might not understand Grid authentication, might not scale to Grid-level usage, {{might not be able}} to understand the operations that are requested to be authorized, and might require an inordinate amount of &quot;glue code &quot; to integrate the native language of the legacy <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> with the Grid software. In this paper, we discuss several challenges and the resulting successful mechanisms for integrating the Globus Toolkit and WSRF. NET with AzMan, a role-based <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> that ships with Windows Server 2003. We leverage the OGSA GGF Authorization Interface and our own SAML implementation so that the enterprise can retain their existing AzMan mechanism while resulting in new, scalable mechanisms for Grid authorization. ...|$|R

Authorized users can deploy the resources {{as if they were}} in the same organization. This resource sharing environment is called a Virtual Organization (VOs). To enable an open Grid to support resource sharing between multiple heterogeneous VOs, an authorization policy management framework is required to support authorization for VOs using heterogeneous <b>authorization</b> <b>systems.</b> The challenges include dynamic Grid memberships, VO trust relationships, and heterogeneous <b>authorization</b> <b>systems.</b> To solve these problems in a loose-coupling way, we propose a dynamic, distributive and heterogeneous authorization policy management framework. The framework is called Dynamic Policy Management Framework (DPMF). DPMF groups VOs of the same <b>authorization</b> <b>systems</b> to form a virtual cluster. Authorization policy management is divided into inter-cluster heterogeneous policy management, and intra-cluster homogeneous policy management. Inside a virtual cluster, the workloads of policy management can be distributed among the VOs according to their trust relationships. The Conflict Analysis with Partial Information (CAPI) mechanism is developed to make authorization decisions in open environments without complete policy information. A Heterogeneous Policy Management mechanism is developed for DPMF to support inter-cluster heterogeneous policy management. Traditional authorization policy management frameworks <b>work</b> well in <b>authorization</b> for a single VO where the participating hosts agree to follow a global <b>authorization</b> <b>system.</b> However, they are not capable of authorization policy management for multiple VOs which deploys heterogeneous <b>authorization</b> <b>systems.</b> Yu, Chiu Man.

In the design of an <b>authorization</b> <b>system,</b> sometimes we just implement the accessenforcement without having a precise semantics for it. In this dissertation we show that, there exists a precise semantics that improves the efﬁciency of access-enforcement over the accessenforcement without precise semantics. We present an algorithm to produce an Access Control List (ACL), in a particular <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> for version control syatems called gitolite, and we compare the implementation of our algorithm against the implementation that is already being used. As another design problem, we consider least-restrictive enforcement of the Chinese Wall security policy. We show that there exists a least-restrictive enforcement of the Chinese Wall Security Policy. Our approach to proving the thesis is by construction; we present an enforcement that is least-restrictive. We also prove that such an enforcement mechanism cannot be subjectindependent. We also propose a methodology that tests the implementation of an <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> to check whether it has properties of interest.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to study {{what is needed to}} create a multi-domain <b>authorization</b> <b>system,</b> allowing applications to access e-Infrastructure resources. A multi-domain <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> allows different autonomous providers to chain their services automatically to create an end-to-end service, whilst retaining the ability to define their own access policies. The research was performed in the context of e-Science communities that use infrastructures at global scale, which capture, process, transport, store, visualise, etc. large amounts of scientific data. Such infrastructures became known as e-Infrastructures. The study contributes to the understanding of what is needed by defining two frameworks and an authorization architecture. The first framework provides a way to articulate authorization scenarios; the second framework helps to understand the role of trust within <b>authorization</b> <b>systems.</b> A generic <b>authorization</b> architecture was defined as a way to help guide the solution design of an <b>authorization</b> <b>system.</b> The generic architecture was validated in collaboration with pioneering Internet research organisations to show its applicability. To allow authorization transaction to happen, involved parties must trust each other. To be trusted in a chain, each service provider must know that any policy rule it executes is correct. Such trust emerges from a common set of rules that may need to be enforced depending on the risk involved. The research on the second framework indicates that the complexity of an <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> can decrease if organisational trust and power is considered along with its design, allowing the use of simple tokens...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research is}} {{in the area of}} attribute-based <b>authorization</b> <b>systems.</b> We address two specific research problems in this area. First, evaluating authorization policies in multi-authority systems where there are multiple stakeholders in the disclosure of sensitive data. The research proposes to consider all the relevant policies related to authorization in real time upon the receipt of an access request and to resolve any differences that these individual policies may have in authorization. Second, to enable a lot of entities to participate in the authorization process by asserting attributes on behalf of the principal accessing resources. Since it is required that these asserted attributes be trusted by the <b>authorization</b> <b>system,</b> it is necessary that these entities are themselves trusted by the <b>authorization</b> <b>system.</b> Two frameworks are proposed to address these issues. In the first contribution a dynamic <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> is proposed which provides conflict detection and resolution among applicable policies in a multi-authority <b>system.</b> The <b>authorization</b> <b>system</b> is dynamic in nature and considers the context of an access request to adapt its policy selection, execution and conflict handling based on the access environment. Efficient indexing techniques are used to increase the speed of authorization policy loading and evaluation. In the second contribution, we propose a framework for service providers to evaluate trust in entities asserting on behalf of service users in real time upon receipt of an access request. This trust evaluation is done based on a reputation system model, which is designed to protect itself against known attacks on reputation systems. Ph. D.
