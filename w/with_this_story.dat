5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> It {{was basically a}} succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E

However, King Arthur dug up the head, declaring {{the country would be}} protected only by his great strength. There have been attempts in modern times to link the still-current practice of keeping ravens at the Tower of London under the care of Yeomen Warder Ravenmaster <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> of Brân, whose name means crow (cigfran means Raven).|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} major {{problems}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and {{had the potential to}} ascend the throne. Indeed, since Hongshi was the son forced to commit suicide, it would have been far more logical for him to be the adopted son, if any of them were.|$|E

The actress connected with Silver through their shared dedication to their careers and their decisions to re-prioritize their lives. When approaching her character, Doherty felt that Silver's story arc was about [...] "honoring her grandfather and finding good friends, a sense of community and love"; she connected <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> line because of her close connections to her own family.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (played by Matthew Fox) leads most of the survivors to the island's radio tower to communicate with a nearby ship.

500|$|Thompson {{felt that}} the {{inclusion}} of slavery as a key theme led to this book being [...] "one of Hergé's more adult-oriented adventures". Nevertheless, Farr noted that the story contained [...] "a good measure of humour" [...] to balance out these darker elements. Farr drew comparisons with Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, a series of novels that was contemporary to The Red Sea Sharks and which was similarly inspired by Balzac's The Human Comedy. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that The Red Sea Sharks represented [...] "the culmination of his golden age", which had begun with The Blue Lotus. He also commented that [...] "it almost seemed as if Hergé had regained the pace and rhythm of his most creative period" [...] <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

500|$|While {{researching the}} book, Taraborrelli {{realized}} {{that one of}} the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships. The opposite proved true; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable, and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy, and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic. Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty. The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna, and the relationship ended with her heart being broken. Taraborelli observed, [...] "So, what I think will surprise people <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> are the many times that Madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected. She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility. But at least in her personal life, and again, I make that distinction, because this isn't necessarily true in her business life, {{she is one of the}} most fragile subjects I've ever written about...This book is really about placing her life into the proper historical context, and once again answering the why questions about her." ...|$|E

Ward quickly retooled the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than feature the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that he believed defined the original pilot. Initially, Ward submitted a rough storyboard that featured Finn and an [...] "oblivious" [...] Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. However, the network was not happy <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> and specifically asked for an episode that contained the same things that had [...] "made the short so special, like the crazy opening dance, the 'Abe Lincoln moment,' funny catchwords, and the awkward princess/kiss moment at the end. Ward then created an early storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original short. Eventually, Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] became the first episode to enter into production.|$|E

500|$|... "Zebras" [...] {{was written}} by Amanda Green and Daniel Truly, and {{directed}} by Peter Leto. The surprise twist in the episode, in which forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran is killed by fellow technician Dale Stuckey, was conceived by Neal Baer, the series executive producer and showrunner. Baer said the decision to kill the character in the story [...] "just came to [...] one day" [...] and thought that [...] "this may be a really interesting way to bring [...] cast together and deal <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> point". In particular, Baer {{said he wanted to}} kill a long-recurring character so the show could [...] "explore characters' reactions to a death in an interesting way". Mike Doyle, the actor who played O'Halloran, was notified about the decision by Baer in a phone call {{a few weeks before the}} episode was filmed in May 2009. Baer said Doyle and the rest of the cast took the news well because, in his words, [...] "I think everybody knew that somebody was going, so they weren't shocked." [...] During a May 2009 interview, Baer hinted at the twist by telling media outlets that the season finale would include a surprise ending: [...] "One of our own is murdered." ...|$|E
500|$|The Colour of Magic is {{the second}} live-action {{adaptation}} of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, following the highly successful Hogfather, which was broadcast over Christmas 2006 {{to an audience of}} 2.6 million. After the success of Hogfather, Pratchett was easily persuaded to release the rights for The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. Vadim Jean was employed to adapt the two literary works into a three-hour, two-part screenplay. [...] While Pratchett was given [...] "carte blanche" [...] to [...] "turn up whenever [...] wanted", he was happy to see a more liberal interpretation of his first two works than he had been for Hogfather. Speaking to Sky Magazine, Pratchett said that, [...] "There [...] not so much emotional baggage... riding on The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic. It was just this book of mine that suddenly started selling incredibly well". Jean's main challenge was to streamline the plot and remove the many irrelevant, but highly amusing, tangents that are an iconic feature of Pratchett's work, without destroying the appeal of the books. [...] Jean said that [...] "there [...] a real danger, <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> that one could strip out the 'Pratchett-ness'... I had to fight to keep [...] in". Pratchett was pleased with the final script, saying [...] "it wasn't the slaughter job I thought it would have to be", and [...] " [...] to keep the soul... it's still recognisably [...] book".|$|E

It aired in January 2007 and again as part of Frederator Studios' Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008. After its release, the short video became a viral hit on the internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, but the network passed on it twice. The studio approached Cartoon Network, which {{said it would be}} willing to produce a series if Ward could prove the short could be expanded into a full series while maintaining elements of the original's pilot. Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network {{to take a chance on}} the show; he recognized the series as [...] "something that felt really indie...comic book-y [...] really new". Ward quickly rethought the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than be characterized by the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that permeated the original film. Ward's college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto helped him produce a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date.

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E

[...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to her—Tucker was the love of her life—but it meant so little to him that he doesn't even recognize Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's so much they can do <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>story.</b> The relationship between Tucker and Devon—my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony.
